   abstract = {© 2016, The Author(s). Since recently, the potential of torrential downpour is increased and the flood damage shows increasing trend, in this study, the method to assess the flood vulnerability was established for the industrial parks, which is the driving power of the economic growth in Korea, and the results were analyzed. The vulnerability of each industrial parks was analyzed using three indicators: climate exposure, sensitivity and the adaptation ability, and the indicator value was calculated by selecting the proxy variable by each indicator. Among the primarily indicators, the final indicators were selected through the site investigation and in-depth interview. The vulnerability assessment was performed not only for the present but for the future (2020s, 2050s and 2100s). In the analysis results, Ulsan Mipo National Industrial Park was the most vulnerable for the present but in 2020s, Gwangyang National Industrial Park and Myeongji-Noksan National Industrial Park in 2050s and 2100s were assessed as most vulnerable. In the results of flooding vulnerability assessment, south coast industrial parks are the most vulnerable region during baseline and future. In addition, such industrial parks mostly built in the early phase of industrialization and they have advantage in import and export but were represented to be highly vulnerable due to aged infrastructures. In the industrial parks, as the enterprises are concentrated, it is easy to exchange the information and logistics, but the damage of natural disasters due to flooding can be aggravated due to the characteristics of the concentration. Actually, there are some cases that the industrial parks and the enterprises received the flooing damage in the highly vulnerable area by the torrential downpour. In this study, the vulnerability assessment was performed for the flooding damage by the torrential downpour for the industrial parks and the potential that the this study can be used as a useful decision-making tool in deciding the priority of adaptation ability was confirmed.},

   abstract = {The present research aimed at analyzing temporal trends in thermal
discomfort indices for a period of 46 years from 1969 to 2014 over
western coastal region of India for seven urban centers during the
months of pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Direct thermal discomfort
indices employed for this purpose were thermo-hygrometric index (THI)
and heat index (HI). Statistical techniques applied for obtaining
temporal trends were linear regression model and Mann-Kendall (MK) rank
test. Statistical significance of the obtained trends was evaluated at
95% confidence level. Sequential MK (SQ-MK) test was used for change
point detection. To investigate actual incidences of thermal discomfort,
daily index values were averaged for standard meteorological weeks
(SMWs) over the study period and decadal percentage of thermal
discomfort during SMWs was estimated. Trend analysis of selected
meteorological parameters such as dry bulb temperature (DBT), wet bulb
temperature (WBT), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS) were
investigated, which might be responsible for variation in thermal
discomfort over the period. The results obtained depicted significant
increase in thermal discomfort over the cities located on the southern
part of west coast, while significant increase was observed during
monsoon season months compared to pre-monsoon season. Decadal variation
in percentage of SMWs falling in various discomfort categories was
studied. At majority of the stations, moderate and high-risk SMWs have
increased over the last two decades. The results of change point
detection for THI and HI denoted significant increase at most of the
stations after 1990s. The study validates increase in thermal discomfort
vulnerability, particularly at thriving urban centers of western coastal
region of India.},

Because of the difficulty in making continuous, accurate measurements of wet bulb globe temperature outdoors, the authors have developed a model of the wet bulb globe temperature that relies only on standard meteorological data available at each storage depot for input. The model is composed of separate submodels of the natural wet bulb and globe temperatures that are based on fundamental principles of heat and mass transfer, has no site-dependent parameters, and achieves an accuracy of better than 1 degree C based on comparisons with wet bulb globe temperature measurements at all depots.},

This study used ﻿natural wet bulb temperature Tw, the globe temperature Tg, and the dry bulb (ambient) temperature Ta to deduce Wet Bulb Globe Temperature(WBGT). <br/>The author describes the model according to 3 parts: Tw, Tg, and Ta. The author calculated Tw based on a model calculating the loss of energy by using pressure(evaporation). Tg is calculated by ﻿the radiative and convective heat transfer process. Tg part illustrates the energy gain by solar radiation. Ta represents ambient temperature. <br/>The author compared the model result from the observation data from several places. The author included a grass area, dessert, and cities. WBGT shows significant bias in the desert area. The authors believe that it caused by ﻿the measured natural wet bulb temperature. However, the model result has less error range than the previous research. The author concluded that the WBGT results are varied in the area because of cloudiness. The author insists that including solar radiation data is likely to reduce the biased results of WBGT.  <br/>This research illustrated the limitation of previous research’s WBGT model. The result shows that Tg is the most important factor and the variations are caused by solar radiation. I think this is the reason why among many other WBGT models, this model has fewer errors and is widely used.},

   abstract = {The study of geography as a discipline has often employed a top-down approach that examines the output of the field's most prominent members. In this paper, we provide a bottom-up approach by analyzing geography dissertations. We start by assembling a database that includes the title, author, date, and university for every geographic doctoral dissertation written in the United States over the last 120 years. The database allows us to track the rise and fall of regions of interest and specific topics. It gives a broad overview of the different schools in geography and their influence within separate historical periods. And it permits a more empirically based delineation of geo-graphical " eras " based on the commonality of words in dissertation titles. This work is at the convergence of the quantitative and qualitative; we quantify and visualize textual data to provide a more robust history of geography. The result is a new, more compre-hensive way to look at the changing discipline of geography. Keywords: history of geogra-phy, textual analysis, dissertations, digital humanities. The essence of contemporary geography—its disciplinary DNA—is bound up in its connections to the past: rich branches of a growing family tree of Ph.D.s, advisors, and institutional homes. Many trace how we arrived at the current state of our discipline. These histories describe shifting paradigms (James and Martin, 1993), subfields (Gaile and Wilmott 2003), or geography's " key think-ers " and their representation of, and influence on, the discipline as it changed over time (Johnston and Sidaway, 2004). Recounting of core geographical debates and profiles of prominent geogra-phers can be quite useful. But at the same time, it is an elite exercise in which changes in geography are examined from the standpoint of its most outstand-ing participants. Characterizing the trends in geography from the bottom up— witnessing the interests of the emergent junior cadre of geographers – is an equally if not more valuable endeavor. In this paper we expand current under-standings of the institutional and disciplinary nature of geography, and its change over time by examining the over 10,000 dissertations produced during the 120+ years that geography has been a doctoral-level discipline in the United States. A digital humanities approach to the history of the discipline allows us to examine this large database of Ph.D. production. We argue that dissertations offer a broad view of the field, which allow us to track the overall output of geographical scholarship by university, take into account the different eras of geography based on dissertation topics, chart *We would like to acknowledge Mark Revell at the Association of American Geographers for providing us with some of the data on dissertations.

Reanalysis data have been widely used, but a comprehensive validation using surface measurements is still highly needed. In this study, we evaluated the Rs estimates from six current representative global reanalyses (NCEP–NCAR, NCEP-DOE; CFSR; ERA-Interim; MERRA; and JRA-55) using surface measurements from different observation networks [GEBA; BSRN; GC-NET; Buoy; and CMA] (674 sites in total) and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) EBAF product from 2001 to 2009. The global mean biases between the reanalysis Rs and surface measurements at all sites ranged from 11.25 W/m2 to 49.80 W/m2. Comparing with the CERES-EBAF Rs product, all the reanalyses overestimate Rs, except for ERA-Interim, with the biases ranging from −2.98 W/m2 to 21.97 W/m2 over the globe. It was also found that the biases of cloud fraction (CF) in the reanalyses caused the overestimation of Rs. After removing the averaged bias of CERES-EBAF, weighted by the area of the latitudinal band, a global annual mean Rs values of 184.6 W/m2, 180.0 W/m2, and 182.9 W/m2 were obtained over land, ocean, and the globe, respectively.},

   abstract = {American Football players are among the most susceptible athletes to heat-related illnesses. Environmental conditions are an important factor when considering risk rates for these illnesses. Thus, we examine the spatio-temporal variations in the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a commonly used metric for heat exposure, and quantify the hazard for extreme heat using safety thresholds specifically derived for athletes from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The objective is to provide better information on heat-related hazards to help mitigate the risk of exertional heat illnesses (EHI) among football players. We created a unique 15-year climatology (1991-2005) of August WBGTs for 217 locations across the contiguous United States using weather station observations and a WBGT model. Thirteen 3-hoverlapping training session times ranging from 6-9 a.m. to 6-9 p.m. were examined to identify how the WBGT varies with the time of day the practice session was held and how frequently the WBGT during those sessions posed a hazard for extreme heat by exceeding two ACSM safety thresholds (30.1°C and 32.3°C). Maximum hazards for extreme heat are located in an arc across the Southern tier of the country, stretching from eastern Texas through to South Carolina as well as across southern Arizona and southeastern California. Climatologically, practice sessions early in the morning and later in the evening were best for minimizing heat exposure while those held from late morning through afternoon, particularly the noon-3 p.m. and 1-4 p.m. periods, had the highest WBGT values and were the practice periods that most frequently exceeded safety thresholds. Delaying the start of afternoon practices a few hours, however, may substantially reduce the likelihood of oppressive conditions and reduce the risk for heat illnesses. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {On August 1, 2001, Korey Stringer, a Pro Bowl offensive tackle for the Minnesota Vikings, became the first and to date the only professional American football player to die from exertional heat stroke (EHS). The death helped raise awareness of the dangers of exertional heat illnesses in athletes and prompted the development of heat safety policies at the professional, collegiate, and interscholastic levels. Despite the public awareness of this death, no published study has examined in detail the circumstances surrounding Stringer's fatal EHS. Using the well-documented details of the case, our study shows that Stringer's fatal EHS was the result of a combination of physiological limitations, organizational and treatment failings, and extreme environmental conditions. The COMfort FormulA (COMFA) energy budget model was used to assess the relative importance of several extrinsic factors on Stringer's EHS, including weather conditions, clothing insulation, and activity levels. We found that Stringer's high-intensity training in relation to the oppressive environmental conditions was the most prominent factor in producing dangerous, uncompensable heat stress conditions and that the full football uniform played a smaller role in influencing Stringer's energy budget. The extreme energy budget levels that led to the fatal EHS would have been avoided according to our modeling through a combination of reduced intensity and lower clothing insulation. Finally, a long delay in providing medical treatment made the EHS fatal. These results highlight the importance of modern heat safety guidelines that provide controls on extrinsic factors, such as the adjustment of duration and intensity of training along with protective equipment modifications based on environmental conditions and the presence of an emergency action plan focused on rapid recognition and immediate on-site aggressive cooling of EHS cases.},

   abstract = {Context: Weather-based activity modification in athletics is an important way to minimize heat illnesses. However, many commonly used heat-safety guidelines include a uniform set of heat-stress thresholds that do not account for geographic differences in acclimatization. Objective: To determine if heat-related fatalities among American football players occurred on days with unusually stressful weather conditions based on the local climate and to assess the need for regional heat-safety guidelines. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Data from incidents of fatal exertional heat stroke (EHS) in American football players were obtained from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research and the Korey Stringer Institute. Patients or Other Participants: Sixty-one American football players at all levels of competition with fatal EHSs from 1980 to 2014. Main Outcome Measure(s): We used the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and a z-score WBGT standardized to local climate conditions from 1991 to 2010 to assess the absolute and relative magnitudes of heat stress, respectively. Results: We observed a poleward decrease in exposure WBGTs during fatal EHSs. In milder climates, 80% of cases occurred at above-average WBGTs, and 50% occurred at WBGTs greater than 1 standard deviation from the long-term mean; however, in hotter climates, half of the cases occurred at near average or below average WBGTs. Conclusions: The combination of lower exposure WBGTs and frequent extreme climatic values in milder climates during fatal EHSs indicates the need for regional activity-modification guidelines with lower, climatically appropriate weather-based thresholds. Established activity-modification guidelines, such as those from the American College of Sports Medicine, work well in the hotter climates, such as the southern United States, where hot and humid weather conditions are common.},

   abstract = {Heat stress, an environmental and occupational hazard, is associated with a spectrum of heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, which can lead to death. CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes recommended occupational exposure limits for heat stress (1). These limits, which are consistent with those of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (2), specify the maximum combination of environmental heat (measured as wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT]) and metabolic heat (i.e., workload) to which workers should be exposed. Exposure limits are lower for workers who are unacclimatized to heat, who wear work clothing that inhibits heat dissipation, and who have predisposing personal risk factors (1,2). These limits have been validated in experimental settings but not at outdoor worksites. To determine whether the NIOSH and ACGIH exposure limits are protective of workers, CDC retrospectively reviewed 25 outdoor occupational heat-related illnesses (14 fatal and 11 nonfatal) investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from 2011 to 2016. For each incident, OSHA assessed personal risk factors and estimated WBGT, workload, and acclimatization status. Heat stress exceeded exposure limits in all 14 fatalities and in eight of 11 nonfatal illnesses. An analysis of Heat Index data for the same 25 cases suggests that when WBGT is unavailable, a Heat Index screening threshold of 85°F (29.4°C) could identify potentially hazardous levels of workplace environmental heat. Protective measures should be implemented whenever the exposure limits are exceeded.

Results Respondents recorded a total average of 6.4 sleep hours during workdays divided over 2.4 sleep periods. Caregivers rated sleep quality as lower while at work; over 40% indicated excessive daytime sleepiness. Female caregivers reported worse sleep outcomes than their male counterparts. Some variations in sleep outcomes were found by employment arrangements. Conclusion Live-in caregivers experience frequent sleep interruptions at all hours of the day and night to attend to patients' needs.

   abstract = {the products. Despite these uncertainties, gridded station data are often treated as observations by users for a par-ticular application. There is a risk that many users are unaware of the accuracy of the gridded product they choose and whether another choice might be more suitable for their purposes. Users will expect downscaled climate products to produce data that match local station data as closely as possible, particularly if gridded data have relatively high spatial resolution. The overall goal of our study is to evaluate the ability of eight widely used, gridded data sets to represent actual weather conditions in the conterminous United States, including extreme weather events. Specifically, our purpose is to evaluate how closely the gridded data match the original station data and thus what information may be altered when a user substitutes a gridded data set in place of meteorological station data. This concern is especially pertinent to extreme weather, which tends to be more localized than general weather phenomena, especially precipitation extremes. To achieve our goal, we focus on four major research questions. Our first question is how well gridded data sets capture temperature and precipitation, based on the expectation that performance may differ greatly between these vari-ables, because precipitation is generally more heteroge-neous than temperature in both space and time. Thus, we anticipated that gridded temperature data would resemble point measurements from nearby weather stations more closely than gridded precipitation data. Our second question is how the accuracy of different downscaled data sets varies among ecoregions. Climate differs considerably among ecoregions, as does topog-raphy, posing challenges for any one-size-fits-all downs-caling algorithm. Therefore, we expected that while one data set would perform best, for instance, in desert ecore-gions, another would be optimal in temperate forest regions. Similarly, given that topography will increase the spatial heterogeneity of both temperature and pre-cipitation, one data set may provide the highest accu-racies in mountainous ecoregions, while another may be optimal in flatter areas. Our third question is how well downscaled data sets capture means vs. extremes. Both mean climate and weather extremes are important for ecological research. Means are typically used to predict the effects of future climate change, but extremes may exert more immediate and profound effects on ecosystems (Jentsch et al. 2009). However, mean climate patterns are more homogeneous in both space and time than extremes, suggesting that differences in interpolation methods may result in dif-ferent accuracies, and we expected accuracies for means to be higher than for extremes. Our fourth and final question is how much the accuracy of the gridded products depends on their spatial resolution. Finer resolution is typically desirable for ecological applications, because many ecological patterns and processes vary at fairly fine resolutions (e.g., less than 1 km). However, while it is technically straightforward to create downscaled weather data sets at any spatial resolution, the question is whether the accuracy of the predicted patterns improves when inter-polated to finer scales. We expect that as their resolution becomes finer, gridded products will more closely align with nearby weather stations and be better able to account for topography, thus matching observational data more realistically, but that improvement could come with a greater risk of false precision and overfitted interpolation models. data and methodS},

Reanalysis data have been widely used, but a comprehensive validation using surface measurements is still highly needed. In this study, we evaluated the Rs estimates from six current representative global reanalyses (NCEP–NCAR, NCEP-DOE; CFSR; ERA-Interim; MERRA; and JRA-55) using surface measurements from different observation networks [GEBA; BSRN; GC-NET; Buoy; and CMA] (674 sites in total) and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) EBAF product from 2001 to 2009. The global mean biases between the reanalysis Rs and surface measurements at all sites ranged from 11.25 W/m2 to 49.80 W/m2. Comparing with the CERES-EBAF Rs product, all the reanalyses overestimate Rs, except for ERA-Interim, with the biases ranging from −2.98 W/m2 to 21.97 W/m2 over the globe. It was also found that the biases of cloud fraction (CF) in the reanalyses caused the overestimation of Rs. After removing the averaged bias of CERES-EBAF, weighted by the area of the latitudinal band, a global annual mean Rs values of 184.6 W/m2, 180.0 W/m2, and 182.9 W/m2 were obtained over land, ocean, and the globe, respectively.},

To quantify the future loss of labor productivity, we used the relationship between the wet-bulb globe temperature and work-rest cycles with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 as the climate change scenarios. If only climate factors are considered, then future labor productivity is expected to decline in most regions from the middle of the twenty-first century onwards (2041-2070). From the late twenty-first century onwards, the productivity of heavy outdoor work could decline by 26.1% from current levels under the RCP 8.5 climate scenario. Further analysis showed that regional differences in labor characteristics and the working population had noteworthy impacts on future labor productivity losses. The heat stress caused by climate change thus has a potentially substantial negative impact on outdoor labor productivity in South Korea.},

While there are more specific methods based on individual physiological measurements to determine heat strain in an individual worker, the WBGT index is used in international and national standards to specify workplace heat stress risks. In order to assess time trends of occupational heat exposure at population level, weather station records or climate modelling are the most widely available data sources. The prescribed method to measure WBGT requires special equipment which is not used at weather stations. We compared published methods to calculate outdoor and indoor WBGT from standard climate data, such as air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. Specific criteria for recommending a method were developed and original measurements were used to evaluate the different methods. We recommend the method of Liljegren et al. (2008) for calculating outdoor WBGT and the method by Bernard et al. (1999) for indoor WBGT when estimating climate change impacts on occupational heat stress at a population level. © 2012 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.},

With many heat-related incidents left unreported, it is often difficult to determine the underlying causal factors. This study aims to provide insights into perceptions of potentially unsafe or uncomfortably hot working conditions that can affect occupational health and safety using information provided by the public and workers to the safety regulator in South Australia (SafeWork SA). Details of complaints regarding heat exposure to the regulator’s “Help Centre” were assembled in a dataset and the textual data analysed thematically. The findings showed that the majority of calls relate to indoor work environments such as kitchens, factories, and warehouses. The main themes identified were work environment, health effects, and organisational issues. Impacts of hot working conditions ranged from discomfort to serious heat-related illnesses. Poor management practices and inflexibility of supervisors featured strongly amongst callers’ concerns. With temperatures predicted to increase and energy prices escalating, this timely study, using naturalistic data, highlights accounts of hot working conditions that can compromise workers’ health and safety and the need for suitable measures to prevent heat stress. These could include risk assessments to assess the likelihood of heat stress in workplaces where excessively hot conditions prevail.},

   abstract = {Background: Farmworkers working in hot and humid environments have an increased risk for heat-related illness (HRI) if their thermoregulatory capabilities are overwhelmed. The manifestation of heat-related symptoms can escalate into life-threatening events. Increasing ambient air temperatures resulting from climate change will only exacerbate HRI in vulnerable populations. We characterize HRI symptoms experienced by farmworkers in three Florida communities. Methods: A total of 198 farmworkers enrolled in 2015-2016 were asked to recall if they experienced seven HRI symptoms during the previous work week. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between selected sociode-mographic characteristics and reporting three or more symptoms. Latent class analysis was used to identify classes of symptoms representing the HRI severity range. We examined sociodemographic characteristics of the farmworkers across the latent classes. Results: The mean age (±SD) of farmworkers was 38.0 (±8) years; the majority were female (60%) and Hispanic (86%). Most frequently reported symptoms were heavy sweating (66%), headache (58%), dizziness (32%), and muscle cramps (30%). Females had three times the odds of experiencing three or more symptoms (OR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.18-6.89). Symptoms fell into three latent classes, which included mild (heavy sweating; class probability = 54%), moderate (heavy sweating, headache, nausea, and dizziness; class probability = 24%), and severe (heavy sweating, headache, nausea, dizziness, muscle cramps; class probability = 22%). Conclusions: Farmworkers reported a high burden of HRI symptoms that appear to cluster in physiologic patterns. Unrecognized accumulation of symptoms can escalate into life-threatening situations if untreated. Our research can inform interventions to promote early recognition of HRI, on-site care, and appropriate occupational health policy. Administrative or engineering workplace controls may also reduce the manifestation of HRI.},

   abstract = {Heat stress, an environmental and occupational hazard, is associated with a spectrum of heat-related illnesses, including heat stroke, which can lead to death. CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes recommended occupational exposure limits for heat stress (1). These limits, which are consistent with those of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) (2), specify the maximum combination of environmental heat (measured as wet bulb globe temperature [WBGT]) and metabolic heat (i.e., workload) to which workers should be exposed. Exposure limits are lower for workers who are unacclimatized to heat, who wear work clothing that inhibits heat dissipation, and who have predisposing personal risk factors (1,2). These limits have been validated in experimental settings but not at outdoor worksites. To determine whether the NIOSH and ACGIH exposure limits are protective of workers, CDC retrospectively reviewed 25 outdoor occupational heat-related illnesses (14 fatal and 11 nonfatal) investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from 2011 to 2016. For each incident, OSHA assessed personal risk factors and estimated WBGT, workload, and acclimatization status. Heat stress exceeded exposure limits in all 14 fatalities and in eight of 11 nonfatal illnesses. An analysis of Heat Index data for the same 25 cases suggests that when WBGT is unavailable, a Heat Index screening threshold of 85°F (29.4°C) could identify potentially hazardous levels of workplace environmental heat. Protective measures should be implemented whenever the exposure limits are exceeded. The comprehensive heat-related illness prevention program should include an acclimatization schedule for newly hired workers and unacclimatized long-term workers (e.g., during early-season heat waves), training for workers and supervisors about symptom recognition and first aid (e.g., aggressive cooling of presumed heat stroke victims before medical professionals arrive), engineering and administrative controls to reduce heat stress, medical surveillance, and provision of fluids and shady areas for rest breaks.},

   abstract = {Objectives-This report examines heat-related mortality, cold-related mortality, and other weather-related mortality during 2006-2010 among subgroups of U.S. residents. Methods-Weather-related death rates for demographic and area-based subgroups were computed using death certificate information. Adjusted odds ratios for weather-related deaths among subgroups were estimated using logistic regression. Results and Conclusions-During 2006-2010, about 2,000 U.S. residents died each year from weather-related causes of death. About 31% of these deaths were attributed to exposure to excessive natural heat, heat stroke, sun stroke, or all; 63% were attributed to exposure to excessive natural cold, hypothermia, or both; and the remaining 6% were attributed to floods, storms, or lightning. Weather-related death rates varied by age, race and ethnicity, sex, and characteristics of decedent's county of residence (median income, region, and urbanization level). Adjustment for region and urbanization decreased the risk of heat-related mortality among Hispanic persons and increased the risk of cold-related mortality among non-Hispanic black persons, compared with non-Hispanic white persons. Adjustment also increased the risk of heat-related mortality and attenuated the risk of cold-related mortality for counties in the lower three income quartiles. The differentials in weather-related mortality observed among demographic subgroups during 2006-2010 in the United States were consistent with those observed in previous national studies. This study demonstrated that a better understanding of subpopulations at risk from weather-related mortality can be obtained by considering area-based variables (county median household income, region, and urbanization level) when examining weather-related mortality patterns.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Data on the health impacts of heatwaves in infants are limited, and this study aimed to examine how heatwaves affect hospital admissions in infants. 

METHODS
A quasi-Poisson generalized additive model was used to assess the effects of heatwaves on hospital admissions in infants from 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2015 in Brisbane, Australia, using a series of heatwave definitions after controlling for possible confounders. A case-only analysis was conducted to examine the possible modification effects of personal and community characteristics on the heatwaves effects on infants' hospital admissions. 

RESULTS
There was no significant increase in infants' hospital admissions when heatwave intensity was defined as mean temperature ≥90th percentile or ≥95th percentile of the mean temperature across the study period. When heatwave intensity increased to ≥97th percentile, infants' hospital admissions increased significantly (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10), and this increase raised with the increase of heatwave duration. No modification effect of gender, indigenous status, or Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) level on heatwave effect was observed. 

CONCLUSIONS
Infants in Brisbane were sensitive to intense heatwaves, and future heat early warning system based on a local evidence-based heatwave definition is needed to protect infants from heatwave impacts. Community-based heatwave adaptation programs aiming at raising the awareness of the adverse health impacts of intense heatwaves among infants' caregivers may relieve the postnatal health care demand in infants.},

   abstract = {Sauter, D. P., 2013: A wet-bulb globe temperature validation study using standard meteorological inputs and modeled solar irradiance. ABSTRACT Heat-stress-related injuries and deaths are a serious concern to the military. A joint Army/Air Force publication (TB MED 507) provides heat stress guidance based on the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), soldier work rate, and clothing level. In a military environment, however, accurate WBGT measurements or predictions (for planning purposes) may not be available or practical to obtain; thus, a physics-based model provides the WBGT value from standard meteorological inputs. Likewise, the surface solar irradiation value (required for the WBGT computation) is determined from a model as a function of cloud amount and type, surface albedo, geographic location, and date/time. The author performed an experimental study to determine the validity of using the two models for obtaining the WBGT. The WBGT and solar irradiation models, as well as the TB MED 507 guidance, have been hosted on an Android-based smartphone to provide heat stress guidance on a highly portable solution for the Army. One advantage of the current capability over WBGT instrumentation is its ability to be used as a planning tool via entry of forecast input parameter values into the algorithm.},

In this study, we analysed 4363 responses to a global online survey on the WPL during heat waves in 2016. The participants were from both developed and developing countries, facilitating estimates of the heat-related WPL across the world for the year. The heat-related WPL for each country involved was then deduced for increases of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C in the global mean surface temperature under the representative concentration pathway scenarios in climate models. The average heat-related WPL in 2016 was 6.6 days for developing countries and 3.5 days for developed countries. The estimated heat-related WPL was negatively correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. When global surface temperatures increased by 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C, the corresponding WPL was 9 (19), 12 (31), 22 (61) and 33 (94) days for developed (developing) countries, quantifying how developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change from a particular point of view. Moreover, the heat-related WPL was unevenly distributed among developing countries. In a 2°C-warmer world, the heat-related WPL would be more than two months in Southeast Asia, the most influenced region. The results are considerable for developing strategy of adaptation especially for developing countries.},

   abstract = {Despite the active applications of thermal comfort indices for heat wave definitions, there is lack of evaluation for the impact of extended days of high temperature on health outcomes using many of the indices. This study compared the impact of heat waves on health outcomes among different heat wave definitions based on thermal comfort and air temperature. We compared heat waves in South Korea (cities and provinces) for the warm season for 2011–2014, using air temperature, heat index (HI), and web-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Heat waves were defined as days with daily maximum values of each index at a specified threshold (literature-based, the 90th and 95th percentiles) or above. Distributed lag non-linear models and meta-analysis were used to estimate risk of mortality and hospitalization for all-causes, cardiovascular causes, respiratory causes and heat disorders during heat wave days compared to non-heat wave days. WBGT identified 1.15 times longer maximum heat wave duration for the study periods than air temperature when the thresholds were based on 90th and 95th percentiles. Over the study period, for heat waves defined by WBGT and HI, the Southwestern region showed the highest total number of heat wave days, whereas for air temperature the longest heat wave days were identified in the southeastern region. The highest and most significant impact of heat waves were found by WBGT for hospitalization from heat disorders (Relative risk = 2.959, 95% CI: 1.566–5.594). In sensitivity analyses using different structure of lags and temperature metrics (e.g., daily mean and minimum), the impacts of heat waves on most health outcomes substantially increased by using WBGT for heat wave definitions. As a result, WBGT and its thresholds can be used to relate heat waves and heat-related diseases to improve the prevention effectiveness of heat wave warnings and give informative health guidelines according to the range of WBGT thresholds.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Heat illness (HI) is a growing global concern; its incidence has risen dramatically across the world in recent years. The individual factors whereby elevated core temperature produces HI are not well-understood. Given known physiological differences between men and women pertaining to temperature regulation, we hypothesized that women would be at increased risk of HI than men. 

OBJECTIVES
We aimed to determine the relative risk of HI in women compared with men through an exhaustive literature review and meta-analysis. 

METHODS
We search PubMed and Ovid Medline databases from inception to Apr 2017. Search terms included all permutations of sex and heat illness (including heatstroke and exertional heat illness) with no language restrictions. We included adult or adolescent human data reporting comparable male and female HI rates. One reviewer identified and screened titles and abstracts. Two independent reviewers applied eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved with a third reviewer. 

RESULTS
Of 5888 articles identified by searches, 36 were included in the systematic review and 22 in the meta-analysis. The mean (standard deviation) quality score was 3.31(1.25)/5. Overall the rate among women was consistently lower than men across the lifespan. The male: female pooled IRR was 2.28 (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 1.66–3.16). There was modest heterogeneity (between-studies variance (τ2) = 0.02). The rates did not differ significantly when corrected for severity or occupation. 

DISCUSSION
The rate of HI was significantly increased in men compared with women. Risk for HI might be conferred by psychological and behavioral factors rather than physiological ones. Further research is required to delineate which groups are at greatest risk, leading to the development of mitigation strategies against HI.

As people begin to experience heat waves more often and in more places, how will individuals respond? Measuring experience with heat simply as exposure to extreme temperatures may not fully capture how people subjectively experience those temperatures or their varied impacts on human health. These impacts may also influence an individual’s response to heat and motivate risk-reduction behaviors. If subjectively experiencing negative health effects from extreme heat promotes protective actions, these effects could be used alongside temperature exposure to more accurately measure extreme heat experience and inform risk prevention and communication strategies according to local community needs.

   abstract = {The majority of assessments of future heat-related health risk are based on projections of heat hazards superimposed solely on current socioeconomic conditions, thus neglecting the potential contribution of drivers of heat stress risk other than climate change. Partly to address this drawback, the climate change research community has developed a new scenario framework, made up of distinct sets of climate and socioeconomic scenarios. The few assessments of future heat-related health risk that have employed this new framework have focused on changes in population exposure but have often not accounted for future populations' vulnerability. In this paper, we combine European Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with Representative Concentration Pathways to provide spatially explicit European projections of heat-related health risk that account for multiple changes in both socioeconomic and climatic conditions. In doing so, we also address the challenge of accounting for projections of determinants of vulnerability under varying levels of socioeconomic development. Results reveal that the proportion of the European population at very high risk of heat stress will show a steady increase – from 0.4% currently to 20.3%, 32.6%, or 48.4% in 2050 depending on the scenario combination – unless substantial political changes occur rapidly and steadily shift the current socioeconomic development pathway towards sustainability. Ambitious mitigation policies associated with rapid technological progress to enhance human capital could also moderate future heat-related health challenges. Such challenges are unevenly spread across Europe, with the Mediterranean region and Scandinavia being respectively the most and the least impacted regions. Future heat-related health challenges are substantially influenced by varying levels of socioeconomic development, primarily through changes in vulnerability – changes in population exposure being only of secondary importance. The former may even have a more significant impact on future heat stress risk than climate change, particularly in the British Isles and in the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, there is an undeniable necessity to consider the future state of vulnerability – and its uncertainties under varying socioeconomic scenarios – when assessing future heat-related health challenges and designing health adaptation strategies.},

   abstract = {There are many studies that have posited an association between extreme temperature and increased mortality. However, most studies use temperature at a single station per city as the reference point to analyze deaths. This leads to exposure misclassification and usually the exclusion of exurban, small town, and rural populations. In addition, few studies control for confounding by PM2.5, which is expected to induce upward bias. The high-resolution temperature and PM2.5 data at a resolution of 1km2 were derived from satellite images and other land use sources. To capture the nonlinear association of temperature with mortality we fit a piecewise linear spline function for temperature, with a change in slope at −1°C and 28°C, the temperature threshold at which mortality in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina increases due to cold and heat, respectively. We conducted stratified analyses by age group, sex, race, education, and urban vs nonurban, as well as sensitivity analyses of different temperature threshold and covariate sets. We found a 0.19% (95% CI=−0.98, 1.34%) increase in mortality for each 1°C decrease in temperature below −1°C and a 2.05% (95% CI=0.87, 3.24%) increase in mortality for each 1°C increase in temperature above 28°C, a 79.8% larger effect size for heat compared to the station-based metric. The effect estimates relying on the monitoring stations were 0.09% (95% CI=−0.79, 0.95%) and 1.14% (95% CI=0.08, 1.57%) for the equivalent temperature changes. The estimates were not confounded by PM2.5. Children under 15 years of age had the largest percentage increase per 1°C increase in temperature (8.19%, 95% CI=−0.38 to 17.49%) followed by Blacks (4.35%, 95% CI=2.22 to 6.53%). Higher education was a protective factor for the effect of extreme temperature on mortality. There was a suggestion that people in less urban areas were more susceptible to extreme temperature. The relationship between temperature and mortality was stronger when using exposure data with more spatial variability than using exposure data based on existing monitors alone.},

The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5% and 10% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years, the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.},

These events can disproportionately impact the health of low-income, minority, and urban populations. To better understand heat-related intervention strategies used by four U.S. cities, we conducted 73 semi-structured interviews with government and non-governmental organization leaders representing public health, general social services, emergency management, meteorology, and the environmental planning sectors in Detroit, MI; New York City, NY; Philadelphia, PA and Phoenix, AZ—cities selected for their diverse demographics, climates, and climate adaptation strategies. We identified activities these leaders used to reduce the harmful effects of heat for residents in their city, as well as the obstacles they faced and the approaches they used to evaluate these efforts. Local leaders provided a description of how local context (e.g., climate, governance and city structure) impacted heat preparedness. Despite the differences among study cities, political will and resource access were critical to driving heat-health related programming. Upon completion of our interviews, we convened leaders in each city to discuss these findings and their ongoing efforts through day-long workshops. Our findings and the recommendations that emerged from these workshops could inform other local or national efforts towards preventing heat-related morbidity and mortality.},

   abstract = {Heatwaves are associated with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat warning systems have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat warning systems. Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat warning systems at US$210,000 compared to the US$468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people’s response to heat warning systems and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of the evidence suggests that heat warning systems are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat warning systems’ measures and improving the utilization of the services.},

Such information could assist in the establishment of plans to prevent heat-stress injuries and help improve the safety and comfort of construction labor working environments. On-site WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) data and labor productivity data related to direct work time, indirect work time and idle time were measured for two construction projects involving 16 rebar workers in the summer of 2014 in Beijing, China. The period from 14:00 to 15:00 was identified as the most hazardous for workers throughout the day, and the period from 07:00 to 09:00 was identified as the least hazardous time. Productivity models were further used to analyze the collected data. The model results demonstrated that high-temperature environments decrease labor productivity, with the percentage of direct work time decreasing by 0.57% and the percentage of idle time increasing by 0.74% when the WBGT increased by 1 °C. Moreover, the percentage of direct work time increased by 0.33% when the workers' experience increased by 1 year and decreased by 0.72% when the workers' age increased by 1 year. Overall, the results demonstrated that high-temperature environments impose heat stress on the human body and decreases labor productivity in the construction industry.},

   abstract = {Occupational fatalities and work-related injuries are more common in Turkey than in most developing and developed countries. Several precautions have been taken concerning the matter, and The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSL 2012) has been passed. These efforts, however, have failed to incorporate in their framework the role of global warming. New legislation is underway for the prevention of occupational diseases , injuries, and fatalities. This is particularly worrisome given that Turkey is in the forefront of countries projected to be affected seriously by climate change. Consequently, a study on the direct and indirect impact of climate change on workers' health and labour productivity is paramount. The main purpose of this research is to present diminishing labour productivity as a consequence of decreased working hours via an estimate of rest hours of workers in manual labour. The climatic outputs of Regional Climate Model (RegCM3) obtained from the ENSEMBLES Project are used to calculate the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) over western Turkey. The study covers the span of years between 1971 and 2100. Moreover, spatial distributions of observed domain are estimated by means of a seasonal analysis, preliminary to a more detailed research. Critical regions, more adversely influenced than others, are identified. The total number of loss days for these critical regions are presented for various time periods. As a result, labour productivity particularly in agriculture and construction is expected to diminish seriously over Central Anatolia, Cyprus, and parts of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean coastal areas. Between 2071 and 2100, deficiency in labour productivity may reach up to 52 % during the summer across some of these critical regions. Though it will be seen that the present study has focused primarily on manual labour and outdoor work in particular, it foreshadows nevertheless the dangerous impact of climate change on occupational health and labour productivity in general.},

   abstract = {Climate change and land use change are increasing average and extreme temperatures. Hotter temperatures can detrimentally affect workers’ health and their economic productivity and livelihoods, especially in rural areas in industrializing countries that may be more vulnerable and less resilient. A growing literature has examined these factors at large spatial scales, yet few studies have done so at finer scales. Micro-level data from developing regions is needed to understand the extent of heat exposure, as well as current and future adaptation strategies of working, healthy, and rural populations. We fill this gap using objective environmental measurements from 3MTM QuestempTM 46 Heat Stress Monitors, as well as survey data from working, healthy, and rural communities in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our data contain two groups: those who work in only open areas, and those who work in both forests and open areas. We document workers’ livelihood strategies, work schedules, perceptions of how temperatures impact their work, and future adaptation strategies for even hotter days. Ambient temperatures are 2.6–8.3 °C cooler in forests compared to open areas, indicating the temperature effects of deforestation can be immediate and significant. Those working only in open areas face up to 6.5 h of exposure to temperatures above the accepted Threshold Limit Value for worker well-being. Workers adapt to hotter temperatures by altering the timing of their work shifts and breaks, indicating our sample is already adapting to increasing temperatures from climate and land use change. We also find differential adaptation strategies between those working only in open areas compared to those working in both forests and open areas, suggesting current acclimatization may be a factor in how people adapt. Our results suggest the need for adaptation and mitigation policies tailored to the unique constraints of rural workers that specifically incorporate extant adaptation strategies.},

   abstract = {Changes in the environmental heat stress need to be properly evaluated to manage the risk of heat-related illnesses, particularly in the context of climate change. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a useful index for evaluating heat stress and anticipating conditions related to heat-related illness in the present climate, but projecting the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we developed a methodological framework for estimating the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT based on the output of general circulation models using only simple calculations. The method was applied to six sites in Japan and its performance was evaluated. The proposed method could reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with a high accuracy. Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s) projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These projections showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity to perform physically demanding activities is expected to decrease. To demonstrate the usefulness of the projected WBGT in planning adaptation measures, we identified the optimal working schedules which would minimize outdoor workers' exposure to heat at a specific site. The results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in the future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased heat exposure only by changing their working hours. This methodological framework and the projections will provide local practitioners with useful information to manage the increased risk of heat stress under climate change.},

   abstract = {Environmental heat illness and injuries are a serious concern for the Army and Marines. Currently, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index is used to evaluate heat injury risk. The index is a weighted average of dry-bulb temperature (T db), black globe temperature (T bg), and natural wet-bulb temperature (T nwb). The WBGT index would be more widely used if it could be determined using standard weather instruments. This study compares models developed by Liljegren at Argonne National Laboratory and by Matthew at the U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine that calculate WBGT using standard meteorological measurements. Both models use air temperature (T a), relative humidity, wind speed, and global solar radiation (R G) to calculate T nwb and T bg. The WBGT and meteorological data used for model validation were collected at Griffin, Georgia and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona. Liljegren (YPG: R 2 = 0.709, p < 0.01; Griffin: R 2 = 0.854, p < 0.01) showed closer agreement between calculated and actual WBGT than Matthew (YPG: R 2 = 0.630, p < 0.01; Griffin: R 2 = 0.677, p < 0.01). Compared to actual WBGT heat categorization, the Matthew model tended to underpredict compared to Liljegren's classification. Results indicate Liljegren is an acceptable alternative to direct WBGT measurement, but verification under other environmental conditions is needed. INTRODUCTION Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are serious concerns for military organizations. In the U.S. military in 2011, a total of 2,652 cases of heat exhaustion, an incident rate of 1.82 per 1,000 person-years, were reported. 1 Preventing casualties is a command responsibility during mission planning and execution in warm and hot environments or during hard work in cooler weather. Heat indices that provide estimates of injury risk because of physical activity and heat exposure are commonly used to assess and reduce the risk of heat causalities. 2-5 At present, the U.S. military uses the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) heat stress index to guide work/rest and hydration practices and reduce the risk of heat illness and injury. 2 However, accurate and timely WBGT information needed to make informed decisions is often not readily available because of the cost and overhead of WBGT sensor systems, including recalibration of electronic monitors and the need to regularly replenish the wet-bulb thermometer's H 2 O reservoir. Fortunately, mathematical models have been developed that estimate WBGT from standard weather measurements, i.e., air temperature (T a), air velocity, radiant load (e.g., direct, diffuse, or reflected solar radiation), and humidity.},

   abstract = {<p>Solar radiation incident at the Earth’s surface is an essential driver of the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface and is also an important input variable in the research on the surface eco-hydrological process. The reanalysis solar radiation dataset is characterized by a long time series and wide spatial coverage and is used in the research of large-scale eco-hydrological processes. Due to certain errors in their production process of the reanalysis of solar radiation products, reanalysis products should be evaluated before application. In this study, three global solar-radiation reanalysis products (ERA-Interim; JRA-55; and NCEP-DOE) in different temporal scales and climate zones were evaluated using surface solar-radiation observations from the National Meteorological Information Center of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA, Beijing, China) and the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA, Zürich, Switzerland) from 2000 to 2009. All reanalysis products (ERA-Interim; JRA-55; and NCEP-DOE) overestimated with an annual bias of 14.86 W/m2, 22.61 W/m2, and 31.85 W/m2; monthly bias of 15.17 W/m2, 21.29 W/m2, and 36.91 W/m2; and seasonal bias of 15.08 W/m2, 21.21 W/m2, and 36.69 W/m2, respectively. In different Köppen climate zones, the annual solar radiation of ERA-Interim performed best in cold regions with a bias of 10.30 W/m2 and absolute relative error (ARE) of 8.98%. However, JRA-55 and NCEP-DOE showed the best performance in tropical regions with a bias of 20.08 W/m2 and −0.12 W/m2, and ARE of 11.00% and 9.68%, respectively. Overall, through the evaluations across different temporal and spatial scales, the rank of the three reanalysis products in order was the ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and NCEP-DOE. In addition, based on the evaluation, we analyzed the relationship between the error (ARE) of the reanalysis products and cloud cover, aerosol, and water vapor, which significantly influences solar radiation and we found that cloud was the main cause for errors in the three solar radiation reanalysis products. The above can provide a reference for the application and downscaling of the three solar radiation reanalysis products.</p>},

The quantity of data increases almost linearly from 1998, when only several hundred stations had data. A quality-control procedure utilizing threshold values along with computing the clear-sky radiation envelope for individual stations was implemented to both screen bad data and rescue informative data. Over two-thirds of the observations are seen as acceptable. There are 15 different surface solar radiation products assessed relative to observations, including reanalyses [Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR), CFS Reanalysis and Reforecast (CFSRR), ERA-Interim, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis Project (JRA-55), MERRA, NARR, and NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 (NCEP-1)], derived products [observations from the CRU and NCEP-1 (CRU-NCEP); Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries (Daymet); Global Land Data Assimilation System, version 1 (GLDAS-1); Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3); Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP); and phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2)], and two satellite products (CERES and GOES). All except the CERES product have daily or finer temporal resolution. The RMSE of spatial biases is greater than 18 W m 22 for 13 of the 15 products over the summer season (June-August). None of the daily resolution products fulfill all three desirable criteria of low (,5%) annual or seasonal bias, high correlation with observed cloudiness, and correct distribution of clear-sky radiation. Some products display vestiges of underlying algorithm issues [e.g., from the Mountain Microclimate Simulation Model, version 4.3 (MTCLIM 4.3)] or bias-correction methods. A new bias-correction method is introduced that preserves clear-sky radiation values and better replicates cloudiness statistics. The current quantity of data over the continental United States suggests that a solar radiation product based on, or enhanced with, observations is feasible.},

   abstract = {This paper validates the performance of the physics-based Physical Solar Model (PSM) data set in the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB) to quantify the accuracy of the magnitude and the spatial and temporal variability of the solar radiation data. Achieving higher penetrations of solar energy on the electric grid and reducing integration costs requires accurate knowledge of the available solar resource. Understanding the impacts of clouds and other meteorological constituents on the solar resource and quantifying intra-/inter-hour, seasonal, and interannual variability are essential for accurately designing utility-scale solar energy projects. Solar resource information can be obtained from ground-based measurement stations and/or from modeled data sets. The availability of measurements is scarce, both temporally and spatially, because it is expensive to maintain a high-density solar radiation measurement network that collects good quality data for long periods of time. On the other hand, high temporal and spatial resolution gridded satellite data can be used to estimate surface radiation for long periods of time and is extremely useful for solar energy development. Because of the advantages of satellite-based solar resource assessment, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the PSM. The PSM produced gridded solar irradiance -- global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance -- for the NSRDB at a 4-km by 4-km spatial resolution and half-hourly temporal resolution covering the 18 years from 1998-2015. The NSRDB also contains additional ancillary meteorological data sets, such as temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure, dew point, and wind speed.

   abstract = {Solar radiation at the Earth's surface is an important driver of meteorological and ecological processes. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of the reanalysis solar radiation produced by NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis) and MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) against the FLUXNET measurements in North America. We found that both assimilation systems systematically overestimated the surface solar radiation flux on the monthly and annual scale, with an average bias error of +37.2 Wm(-2) for NARR and of +20.2 Wm(-2) for MERRA. The bias errors were larger under cloudy skies than under clear skies. A postreanalysis algorithm consisting of empirical relationships between model bias, a clearness index, and site elevation was proposed to correct the model errors. Results show that the algorithm can remove the systematic bias errors for both FLUXNET calibration sites (sites used to establish the algorithm) and independent validation sites. After correction, the average annual mean bias errors were reduced to +1.3 Wm(-2) for NARR and +2.7 Wm(-2) for MERRA. Applying the correction algorithm to the global domain of MERRA brought the global mean surface incoming shortwave radiation down by 17.3 W m(-2) to 175.5 W m(-2). Under the constraint of the energy balance, other radiation and energy balance terms at the Earth's surface, estimated from independent global data products, also support the need for a downward adjustment of the MERRA surface solar radiation.},

ISIS is implemented in two levels. Level 1 addresses incoming radiation only, and level 2 addresses the surface radiation balance. Level 2 also constitutes the SURFRAD (Surface Radiation) program of the NOAA Office of Global Programs, specifically intended to provide radiation data to support large-scale hydrologic studies that will be conducted under the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment. Eventually, it is planned for level 2 sites to monitor all components of the surface energy balance. Both levels of ISIS will eventually measure both visible and UV radiation components. At present, there are nine sites that are considered to be at ISIS level 1 standard and an additional four level 2 SURFRAD sites. A 10th level 1 site will be in operation soon. Plans call for an increase in the number of sites of both kinds, up to about 15 ISIS sites, of which 6 will be at the SURFRAD level.

The need for an effective hourly updated assimilation and modeling system for the United States for situational awareness and related decision-making has continued to increase for various applications including aviation (and transportation in general), severe weather, and energy. The RAP is distinct from the previous RUC in three primary aspects: a larger geographical domain (covering North America), use of the community-based Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (ARW) replacing the RUC forecast model, and use of the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system (GSI) instead of the RUC three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar). As part of the RAP development, modifications have been made to the community ARW model (especially in model physics) and GSI assimilation systems, some based on previous model and assimilation design innovations developed initially with the RUC. Upper-air comparison is included for forecast verification against both rawinsondes and aircraft reports, the latter allowing hourly verification. In general, the RAP produces superior forecasts to those from the RUC, and its skill has continued to increase from 2012 up to RAP version 3 as of 2015. In addition, the RAP can improve on persistence forecasts for the 1-3-h forecast range for surface, upper-air, and ceiling forecasts.},

This paper describes the implementation , testing, and results of a newly modified bulk microphysical parameterization with explicit cloud droplet nucleation and ice activation by aerosols. Idealized tests and a high-resolution, convection-permitting, continental-scale, 72-h simulation with five sensitivity experiments showed that increased aerosol number concentration results in more numerous cloud droplets of overall smaller size and delays precipitation development. Furthermore, the smaller droplet sizes cause the expected increased cloud albedo effect and more subtle longwave radiation effects. Although increased aerosols generally hindered the warm-rain processes, regions of mixed-phase clouds were impacted in slightly unexpected ways with more precipitation falling north of a synoptic-scale warm front. Aerosol impacts to regions of light precipitation, less than approximately 2.5 mm h 21 , were far greater than impacts to regions with higher precipitation rates. Comparisons of model forecasts with five different aerosol states versus surface precipitation measurements revealed that even a large-scale storm system with nearly a thousand observing locations did not indicate which experiment produced a more correct final forecast, indicating a need for far longer-duration simulations due to the magnitude of both model forecast error and observational uncertainty. Last, since aerosols affect cloud and precipitation phase and amount, there are resulting implications to a variety of end-user applications such as surface sensible weather and aircraft icing.},

The use of a quasi-isentropic coordinate for the analysis increment allows the influence of observations to be adaptively shaped by the potential temperature structure around the observation, while the hourly update cycle allows for a very current analysis and short-range forecast. Herein, the RUC analysis framework in the hybrid coordinate is described, and some considerations for high-frequency cycling are discussed. A 20-km 50-level hourly version of the RUC was implemented into operations at NCEP in April 2002. This followed an initial implementation with 60-km horizontal grid spacing and a 3-h cycle in 1994 and a major upgrade including 40-km horizontal grid spacing in 1998. Verification of forecasts from the latest 20-km version is presented using rawinsonde and surface observations. These verification statistics show that the hourly RUC assimilation cycle improves short-range forecasts (compared to longer-range forecasts valid at the same time) even down to the l-h projection. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

Here, the explicit precipitation-type diagnostic method is described as used in conjunction with the Thompson et al. scheme in the RAP and HRRR models. The postprocessing logic combines the explicitly predicted multispecies hydrometeor data and other information from the model forecasts to produce fields of surface precipitation type that distinguish between rain and freezing rain, and to also portray areas of mixed precipitation.

   abstract = {Results WBGT exceeded threshold limit values for moderate/ heavy work for 73% outdoor workers (28.9°C±2.4°C) and 67% indoor workers (28.8°C±3.5°C). Heat stress and heat-strain indicators were significantly associated (p=0.0001) and outdoor workers had 2.2 times greater risk of heat-strain during hot seasons (95% CI: 1.695-2.937). Compared to indoor workers, the outdoor workers ran a higher risk of self-reported health decrements (OR: 6.4; 95% CI: 3.884-10.350; p=0.0001), dehydration (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 2.352-3.999) and productivity losses (OR: 8.0; 95% CI: 4.911-13.382). In select occupations, while indoor workers exposed to chronic high-heat had a higher percentage of kidney stones (9%), the outdoor workers with long years of heat exposures had the higher risk of reduced kidney function (14%) due to repeated dehydration, volume depletion, and Acute Kidney Injury. Conclusion We discuss implications for workers' health and productivity as climate modeling shows seriously increasing outdoor and indoor heat problems without suitable control measures for cooling. Strong protective labor policies and research are imperative to avoid serious health impacts and to maintain productivity. High heat exposure and heat-related health impacts is a well-known occupational health hazard. Though recent studies have quantified high heat impacts on labor productivity in occupational group, little is known about the scale of economic impacts of labor productivity losses, resulting in inadequate policy response. Besides, sectors that suffer most from heat, such as agriculture, service and construction, have extensive interdependent relationship with other sectors in the economy. Therefore, it is also important to include these indirect impacts, to avoid the underestimation of the economy-wide impacts. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model can capture direct and indirect economic impact of heat on labor productivity and do the comprehensive analysis. In this study, we used WBGT to estimate future labor productivity changes. Meanwhile we employed a China dynamic CGE model (CHEER) with 2012 as base year in the paper to investigate the economic impacts of heat on labor productivity and to find out the specific sectors' losses and the whole-economy losses in China. Taking temperature projections (daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature , and daily average temperature) under RCP scenario, population projections (demographic age structure and employment structure) under SSP scenario in China as input and dividing China's economic sector into 22 sectors in our model, we analyzed 22 sectors' economic impacts in the long term. Based on these scenarios, our study quantifies the full scope of economic impact of heat on labor productivity and analyze the changes of GDP, specific sectors output and industrial structure in the future. Our study could contribute to the understanding of social cost of carbon in China. A range of measures for different economic sectors were also suggested to reduce future economic loss from heat in China. Future research needs were discussed at the end of the paper. The negative effects of heat stress on work tolerance are well known. In order to optimise exercise tolerance in the heat, various physiological strategies can be employed to alter heat strain such as optimising work-rest cycles, maximising aerobic fitness, heat acclimatisation, pre-exercise cooling and fluid ingestion. In order to optimise workers' health and productivity in the heat, there is an urgent need for collaborative efforts across various disciplines. A holistic heat management programme requires accurate quantification of the impact due to heat stress before formulating and evaluating the eventual heat mitigation strategies.

   abstract = {activity level. This information was used to build an appropriate repeated measures model including demographics and work-related attributes. Results Final analyses included 318 Latina/o farmworkers. Only 70 subjects (22%) were a healthy BMI, and 115 subjects (36%) were considered obese (BMI !30). None were underweight. The majority of participants were paid hourly (n=233, 73%) as opposed to piece-rate (n=85, 27%). Activity counts averaged 452, or a low intensity activity level. In the final repeat measures model, work activity was inversely associated with WBGT, for every oC increase in WBGT activity decreased by 4.5 counts (95% CI 1.2-7.6) P 0.01. Other independent negative associations with activity were found with age and male gender. An interaction was found between piece-rate workers and gender. Male piece rate workers did not decrease activity levels with WBGT, but females and hourly paid workers did. Conclusion In general, farmworkers decrease their work activity with increasing environmental heat. Men, especially piece-rate workers are less likely to decrease their activity levels putting them at increased risk of HRI. There have been many laboratory studies of the effect of heat on the health of individuals in sport, at work or in the military. However, epidemiological studies are needed to develop impact assessment of climate change. In this presentation we outline the development and use of population-exposure risk functions for different heat effects. The first risk function is for heat discomfort based on the predicted mean vote with 10% population feeling discomfort at WBGT=21C and with 90% affected at 29C. The second population risk function is for heat exhaustion which we derive by using epidemiological data from the US military. 10% of the population is affected by heat exhaustion at WBGT=31C increasing up to 90% of the population affected at a WBGT=38C. The most severe population risk is heat stroke for which we use hospital data to calculate 10% of the population affected by heat stroke at WBGT=41C and 90% of the population at WBGT=44C. These health effects of heat create different durations of ill health, with serious heat stroke causing prolonged periods of disability. Based on climate modelling and our risk functions the number of people affected globally can be calculated. For heat stroke, few persons working in the shade at 300W metabolic rate, will currently suffer from heat levels that can cause heat stroke. By 2085 half a million workers (at 300W) will be exposed to heat levels that cause heat stroke. As for becoming totally exhausted (and unable to work) while working at 300W in the sun, currently that stands at about 124 million worldwide, but in 2085 that number will jump to 835 million. Additional epidemiological studies are utilised to validate these risk estimates at local and national level. Introduction Hot weather poses occupational health and safety concerns for outdoor workers or those in non-cooled indoor environments. The risk of occupational injuries increases during hot weather, however limited understanding exists on underlying factors associated with this increase in risk. While recommendations and guidelines for preventing heat-related health impacts include hydration, cooling practices, adequate ventilation and rescheduling work, the extent to which these recommendations are adopted in workplaces is currently unknown. Methods A national online survey was conducted among health and safety representatives (HSRs) to better understand the nature of heat-related injuries. Responses relating to risk factors and preventive measures associated with reported injuries in workplaces were identified using log-poisson regression models. Results In total, 222 HSRs completed the survey. Overall, more than a third (43%) of HSRs reported that injuries or incidents caused by hot/very humid weather occur sometimes/ often in their workplace. Factors found to be positively associated with reported injuries included 'the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE)', 'inadequate resources and facilities' and 'new workers'. For outdoor workers, the most frequently adopted preventive measures were provision of PPE, sunscreen and access to cool drinking water. HSRs reported more injuries if certain preventive measures (rescheduling work to cooler times and shaded rest/work areas) were adopted never/rarely/sometimes compared to often/always. Access to cool drinking water and provision of PPE were the most frequently adopted preventive measures for indoor workers. For this group, HSRs reported more injuries if certain preventive measures (self-pacing, shielding of heat sources and adequate ventilation) were adopted never/rarely/ sometimes. Conclusion Findings indicate that organisational issues, workplace hazards, personal factors and preventive measures, are all determinants of heat-related injuries in Australian workplaces. Wider adoption of prevention measures such as work rescheduling, self-pacing, provision of shade and adequate ventilation could reduce incidence of heat-related injuries in outdoor and indoor workplaces.},

   abstract = {stakeholders such as occupational health and safety professionals (HSPs) on injury risk factors during hot weather may assist in informing injury prevention efforts. Methods A national online survey of HSPs was undertaken. Collected data included perspectives on injury experiences, current preventive measures, training, policies and guidelines, and barriers for prevention. Results were analyzed descriptively and a log-poisson regression was used to identify risk factors associated with reported injuries during hot weather at workplaces the HSPs visited/managed. Results In total there were 307 respondents, the majority of who acknowledged the potential for increased risk of occupational injuries in hot weather. A variety of injury types and mechanisms were reported, including manual handling injuries, hand injuries, wounds or lacerations and loss of control of power tools. Work factors significantly associated with reported injuries included problems with personal protective equipment; lack of shade; inadequate hydration and rest breaks, and problems with supervision. Less than half (42%) of HSPs stated the availability of adequate heat training for staff and 54% reported the provision for outdoor work to cease if temperatures are extreme as a preventive measure in workplaces they visited/managed. HSPs recommended 'heat stress training' as the most important preventive measure for outdoor and indoor workers. Reported barriers for prevention include: lack of awareness by workers and supervisors of injury risks, and management concerns about productivity loss and/or deadlines. Conclusion These findings point to a range of modifiable work and organisational risk factors for injury during hot weather. More attention to these factors, in conjunction with traditional interventions for heat-induced illness, could enhance injury prevention in the workplace. Recent global analysis of current and future ambient heat conditions has shown that occupational heat exposure in Pacific countries, measured or projected as WBGT, is among the most extreme in the world. Many Pacific countries face a serious and unprecedented collision of adverse environmental, sociocultural/demographic and chronic health factors. Environmentally , high temperatures and humidity exist several months each year, reducing physical work capacity. Conservative assessments reveal annual loss of healthy work hours for a person working at 400 W metabolic rate in countries like Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Nauru and Guam increasing from 2%-3% to 9%-18% by 2100, based on the RCP6.0 pathway for climate change. Socio-culturally, such countries have low average income levels and high reliance on primary industries, so occupational and domestic exposure to ambient heat is chronic and somewhat intractable. Health wise, such countries have among the highest burden of chronic cardiometabolic disease in the world. Diabetes is already prevalent (20%-35%), as is hypertension. Casual links between heat exposure and cardiovascular health problems is strengthening and these health problems are becoming a major threat to health in Pacific countries. A diet that is increasingly more divergent from traditional foods is one key factor, but increasing heat conditions will contribute, particularly for people working in physically intensive occupations. Obesity is also prevalent, which is relevant because it adds to heat production while concurrently reducing heat loss, thereby impairing work capacity and tolerance of humid heat. Collectively these factors compromise thermal tolerance, reduce functional capacity and contribute to cardiometabolic disease. This paper will analyse the physiological base for the heat effects on cardiovascu-lar disease with particular reference to occupational heat exposure, and estimate the impacts of climate change in the Pacific countries as well as identify solutions to reduce the future impacts. Exposure to extreme heat negatively affects occupational health. Heat stress indices like Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) combine temperature and humidity and allow quantifying the climatic impact on human physiology and clinical health. Multi-day periods of high heat stress (aka. heat waves) affect occupational health and productivity independently from the absolute temperature levels; e.g. well-documented heatwaves in Europe caused disruption, hospitalisations and deaths (2003 French heat wave: more than 1000 extra deaths, 15-65 years, mainly men) even though the temperatures were within the normal range of hotter countries. Climate change is likely to increase frequency and severity of periods of high heat stress. However, current global grid-cell based climate models are not designed to predict heat waves, neither in terms of severity or frequency. By analysing 37 years of historic daily heat index data from almost 5000 global weather stations and comparing them to widely used grid-cell based climate model outputs over the same period, our research explores methods to assess the frequency and intensity of heat waves as well as the associated occupational health effects at any location around the world in the future. Weather station temperature extreme values (WBGT) for the 3 hottest days in 30 years exceed the mean WBGT of the hottest month calculated from climate models in the same grid-cell by about 2 degrees in the tropics but by 10 degrees at higher latitudes in temperate climate regions. Our model based on the relationship between actual recorded periods of elevated heat-stress and grid-cell based climate projections, in combination with population and employment projections, can quantify national and regional productivity loss and health effects with greater certainty than is currently the case.},

   abstract = {Although the European Alps are one of the most investigated regions worldwide, maps depicting climate change by means of climate classification are still not-existent. To contribute to this topic, a time series of very high resolution (30 arc-seconds) maps of the well-known Köppen-Geiger climate classification is presented. The maps cover the greater Alpine region located within the geographical domain of 4 to 19 degrees longitude and 43 to 49 degrees latitude. Gridded monthly data were selected to compile climate maps within this region. Observations for the period 1800–2010 were taken from the historical instrumental climatological surface time series of the greater Alpine region, HISTALP. Projected climate data for the period 2011–2100 were taken, as an example, from the Rossby Centre regional atmospheric model RCA4. Temperature fields were spatially disaggregated by applying the observed seasonal cycle of the environmental lapse rate. The main results of this study are, therefore, 366 observed and predicted (two scenarios) very high resolution Köppen-Geiger climate maps of the greater Alpine region covering the period 1800–2100. Digital data, as well as animated maps, showing the shift of the climate zones are provided on the following website http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at. Furthermore, the relationship between the Köppen-Geiger climate classification and the altitudinal belts of the Alps is demonstrated by calculating the boundaries of the climate zones, i.e. the deciduous forest line, the mixed forest line, the forest and tree line (timber line) and the snow line. The mean altitude of the potential timber line in the greater Alpine region, for example, was calculated to be 1730 m by the end of the 19th century, 1880 m by the end of the 20th century and to lie between 2120 and 2820 m by the end of the 21st century. The latter altitudes were projected for the greenhouse gas scenarios RCP 2.6 (best case) and RCP 8.5 (worst case). The altitude of the timber line (and the other boundaries of the altitudinal belts) is generally higher in the Western Alps, showing a clear west-east slope.},

   abstract = {Objectives The primary objective of this study was to assess the relationship between heat exposure and occu- pational traumatic injuries among construction workers. Methods We assessed the relationship between humidex, a measure of apparent temperature, and Washington State Fund workers’ compensation injuries among outdoor construction workers using a case-crossover design with time- stratified referent selection. Warm month (March–October) adult outdoor construction traumatic injury claims from 2000–2012 were spatiotemporally joined with high-resolution meteorological data. We used conditional logistic regression with linear splines to assess the association between maximum daily humidex and injuries. Results There were 63 720 occupational traumatic injury claims in construction that met our eligibility cri- teria during the study period. The traumatic injury odds ratio (OR) was 1.005 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003–1.007] per one °C change in humidex. In the spline analyses, we observed a nearly linear association of humidex with the risk of a traumatic injury. Effect estimates were higher among younger (18–24 years) and older (>54 years) workers, workers with lower extremity injuries, workers with less job experience, smaller employers, workers working in Western Washington, and time of injury before 12:30 hours, although CI of effect estimates overlapped in stratified analysis categories. Conclusions In this study of Washington outdoor construction workers, increasing maximum daily humidex was associated with increasing traumatic injury risk. Further work should explore mechanisms of the association between heat exposure and traumatic injuries. Injury prevention efforts targeted at construction should address heat- related risk factors. In addition, heat awareness campaigns should address outcomes beyond heat-related illness.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Outdoor workers face elevated and prolonged heat exposures and have limited access to air-conditioned spaces. This study's overarching research aim is to increase knowledge of municipal worker heat exposure and adaptation practices. The study's sub-objectives are: (1) quantifying exposure misclassification from estimating personal heat exposure from the official weather station; (2) surveying worker's knowledge and practices to adapt to extreme heat; and (3) relating heat exposure and adaptation practices to self-reported thermal comfort., METHODS: Participants wore a personal heat exposure sensor over 7 days from June 1st to July 3rd, 2015 in Tallahassee, Florida US. Next, participants confirmed the days that they wore the sensor and reported their daily thermal comfort and heat adaptations. Finally, participants completed an extreme heat knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey., RESULTS: Some participants (37%) experienced hotter and more humid conditions (heat index > 2) than the weather station. The most common heat adaptations were staying hydrated (85%), wearing a hat (46%), and seeking shade (40%). During work hours, higher temperatures increased the odds (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.41, p = 0.016) of a participant feeling too hot. Shifting work duty indoors made workers to feel more comfortable (odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.70, p = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: In hot and humid climates, everyday, heat exposures continuously challenge the health of outdoor workers.},

   abstract = {This article presents a systematic framework to identify barriers that may impede the process of adaptation to climate change. The framework targets the process of planned adaptation and focuses on potentially challenging but malleable barriers. Three key sets of components create the architecture for the framework. First, a staged depiction of an idealized, rational approach to adaptation decision-making makes up the process component. Second, a set of interconnected structural elements includes the actors, the larger context in which they function (e.g., governance), and the object on which they act (the system of concern that is exposed to climate change). At each of these stages, we ask (i) what could impede the adaptation process and (ii) how do the actors, context, and system of concern contribute to the barrier. To facilitate the identification of barriers, we provide a series of diagnostic questions. Third, the framework is completed by a simple matrix to help locate points of intervention to overcome a given barrier. It provides a systematic starting point for answering critical questions about how to support climate change adaptation at all levels of decision-making.},

   abstract = {While there is a recognised need to adapt to changing climatic conditions, there is an emerging discourse of limits to such adaptation. Limits are traditionally analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological, economic or technological parameters. This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society and hence contingent on ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk and culture. We review insights from history, sociology and psychology of risk, economics and political science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation. First, any limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse values. Second, adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight of risk. Third, social and individual factors limit adaptation action. Fourth, systematic undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real, experienced but subjective limits to adaptation. We conclude that these issues of values and ethics, risk, knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation, but that these limits are mutable. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

However, evidence of the effectiveness of such interventions is rarely cited for justification. Our objective was to review peer-reviewed and grey literature evaluating interventions aimed at reducing morbidity and/or mortality in populations during hot weather episodes. Among studies considering public risk perceptions, most respondents were aware when an extreme heat episode was occurring but did not necessarily change their practices, primarily due to a lack of self-perception as vulnerable and confusion about the appropriate actions to be taken. Among studies of health outcomes during and following heat episodes, studies were suggestive of positive impacts in reducing morbidity and mortality. While the limited evaluative work to date suggests a positive impact of public health interventions, concern persists about whether the most vulnerable groups, like the elderly and homeless, are being adequately reached.},

   abstract = {Abstract Public health adaptation to climate change is an important issue and inevitably is needed to address the adverse health impacts of climate change over the next few decades. This paper provides an overview of the constraints and barriers to public health adaptation and explores future research directions in this emerging field. An extensive literature review was conducted in 2010 and published literature from 2000 to 2010 was retrieved. This review shows that public health adaptation essentially can operate at two levels, namely, adaptive-capacity building and implementation of adaptation actions. However, there are constraints and barriers to public health adaptation arising from uncertainties of future climate and socioeconomic conditions, as well as financial, technologic, institutional, social capital, and individual cognitive limits. The opportunities for planning and implementing public health adaptation are reliant on effective strategies to overcome these constraints and barriers. It is proposed here that high research priority should be given to multidisciplinary research on the assessment of potential health impacts of climate change, projections of health impacts under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios, identification of health co-benefits of mitigation strategies, and evaluation of cost-effective public health adaptation options. © 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

Strava Metro data has the potential to promote studies of cycling and health by indicating where commuting and non-commuting cycling activities are at a large spatial scale (street level and intersection level).

COST Free for the standard app, but the user can choose to pay £4.49/month or £44.99/year for the premium version that offers extended functionality. ABOUT THE APP Strava has been created for cyclists and runners to track their activities and offer analysis on their performance. It maps the route taken and tracks the pace achieved. Once a route is completed this data is uploaded onto the app and website with subsequent analysis of the activity; calories burned, average speed, maximum speed, speed over certain distances, and heart rate (if a compatible monitor was used during activity). The reason that Strava has become so popular is its emphasis on competition. Users are able to analyse their speed or time taken (ie, activity scores) to complete a route or a self-determined segment of the route. A leader board is created and individual users can challenge previous activity scores within the route or segments in an attempt to attain a personal best (PB). Strava itself also regularly posts challenges, such as time to complete certain routes or time taken to climb hill segments. There is also a large social emphasis within the Strava app-you can follow your friends' activities and compare performances. The premium version of Strava allows users to customise leader boards by age and weight to create a more even comparison to one's own activity scores. More advanced analysis is available, including a 'Suffer Score' that gives a breakdown of just how much users punished themselves during workouts based on heart rate data. It also allows analysis of real time segment updates during activity. The premium version also provides a personal heat map that demonstrates your most popular routes and the also gives the opportunity to down-load GPX files which means you can even explore routes created by other Strava users.},

Keywords: bicycle volume; tracking data; Strava; network analysis; eigenvector spatial filtering 3 1. INTRODUCTION Large cycling volumes with sufficient spatial detail and temporal coverage are necessary to understand temporal fluctuations and spatial variation of bicycle ridership (Jestico et al. 2016). The growing prominence of fitness apps, such as Strava, Endomondo, or MapMyRide, which are operated on smart phones, smart watches, or fitness bands, have increased the sampling size of users to the millions (Romanillos et al. 2016). These apps provide data coverage for a large area on a continued basis, which makes app-based crowd-sourcing methods particularly suitable for transportation planning tasks. Although crowd-sourced data have their drawbacks, including user selection bias or geographic bias, their sheer volume and coverage outweighs their disadvantages for many types of analyses. Crowd-sourced tracking data can, for example, supplement permanent count stations that show long-term changes and trends in cycling frequency but lack spatial detail (Griffin et al. 2014). This study develops a set of linear regression models that explore how characteristics of the road network and the built environment and demographic variables are associated with non-commute and commute cycling volume and cycling volume on weekends and weekdays. The analysis is conducted at the census block group level in part of urban and rural Miami-Dade County. As tracking data source 2015 Strava Metro roll-ups from Miami-Dade County are used. This Strava product contains cycling activity counts per road segment summed up over a given period of time. These counts can then be aggregated at the census block group level. This study expands the analysis of Strava data conducted in previous work (Griffin and Jiao 2015; Sanders et al. 2017; Conrow et al. 2018) in geographic coverage, the range of network related predictor variables, and in analysis technique by integrating eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) to handle spatial autoregression in residuals. Other studies conducted on the Miami-Dade road network analyzed, for example, the effect of road network architecture on observed automobile trip distances (Parthasarathi et al. 2012) and on the shape and size of household activity spaces (Parthasarathi et al. 2015). Another study assessed the completeness of designated bicycle lane features and off-road bicycle trails in the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping platform (Hochmair et al. 2015). The presented study demonstrates that crowd-sourced GPS tracking data are suitable to determine the association between the presence of local infrastructure features (e.g. bridges, bike parks) and cycling volume, and to identify distinct spatial patterns of commute, non-commute, weekday, and weekend cycling activities across the study area.},

   abstract = {Mobile fitness tracking apps allow users to track their workouts and share them with friends through online social networks. Although the sharing of personal data is an inherent risk in all social networks, the dangers presented by sharing personal workouts comprised of geospatial and health data may prove especially grave. While fitness apps offer a variety of privacy features, at present it is unclear if these countermeasures are sufficient to thwart a determined attacker, nor is it clear how many of these services' users are at risk. In this work, we perform a systematic analysis of privacy behaviors and threats in fitness tracking social networks. Collecting a month-long snapshot of public posts of a popular fitness tracking service (21 million posts, 3 million users), we observe that 16.5% of users make use of Endpoint Privacy Zones (EPZs), which conceal fitness activity near user-designated sensitive locations (e.g., home, office). We go on to develop an attack against EPZs that infers users' protected locations from the remaining available information in public posts, discovering that 95.1% of moderately active users are at risk of having their protected locations extracted by an attacker. Finally, we consider the efficacy of state-of-the-art privacy mechanisms through adapting geo-indistinguishability techniques as well as developing a novel EPZ fuzzing technique. The affected companies have been notified of the discovered vulnerabilities and at the time of publication have incorporated our proposed countermeasures into their production systems.},

   abstract = {In development of sustainable transportation and green city, policymakers encourage people to commute by cycling and walking instead of motor vehicles in cities. One the one hand, cycling and walking enables decrease in air pollution emissions. On the other hand, cycling and walking offer health benefits by increasing people's physical activity. Earlier studies on investigating spatial patterns of active travel (cycling and walking) are limited by lacks of spatially fine-grained data. In recent years, with the development of information and communications technology, GPS-enabled devices are popular and portable. With smart phones or smart watches, people are able to record their cycling or walking GPS traces when they are moving. A large number of cyclists and pedestrians upload their GPS traces to sport social media to share their historical traces with other people. Those sport social media thus become a potential source for spatially fine-grained cycling and walking data. Very recently, Strava Metro offer aggregated cycling and walking data with high spatial granularity. Strava Metro aggregated a large amount of cycling and walking GPS traces of Strava users to streets or intersections across a city. Accordingly, as a kind of crowdsourced geographic information, the aggregated data is useful for investigating spatial patterns of cycling and walking activities, and thus is of high potential in understanding cycling or walking behavior at a large spatial scale. This study is a start of demonstrating usefulness of Strava Metro data for exploring cycling or walking patterns at a large scale.},

Extracting and learning knowledge from GPS data can provide useful geographic information that can be used for the design of novel applications. In this paper we address the problem of identifying the sport from a GPS track that is recorded during a sport session. For that purpose, we store 8500 GPS tracks from ten different kinds of sports. We extract twelve features that are able to represent the activity that was recorded in a GPS track. From these features several models are induced by diverse machine learning classification techniques. We study the problem from two different perspectives: flat classification, i.e, models classify the track in one of the ten possible sport types; and hierarchical classification, i.e. given the high number of classes and the structure of the problem, we induce a hierarchy in the classes and we address the problem as a hierarchical classification problem. For this second framework, we analyse three different approaches. According to our results, multiclassifier systems based on decision trees obtain the better performance in both scenarios.},

This characterisation is contrasted with other discussions of personal informatics and the quantified self. The paper reports an interview study with activity tracker users. The study found: people do not logically organise, but interweave various activity trackers, sometimes with ostensibly the same functionality; that tracking is often social and collaborative rather than personal; that there are different styles of tracking, including goal driven tracking and documentary tracking; and that tracking information is often used and interpreted with reference to daily or short term goals and decision making. We suggest there will be difficulties in personal informatics if we ignore the way that personal tracking is enmeshed with everyday life and people's outlook on their future.},

   abstract = {© 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Policymakers pay much attention to effectively increasing frequency of people’s cycling in the context of developing sustainable and green  cities. Investigating associations of environmental characteristics and cycling behaviour could offer implications for changing urban infrastructure aiming at encouraging active travel. However, earlier examinations of associations between environmental characteristics and active travel behaviour are limited by low spatial granularity and coverage of traditional data. Crowdsourced geographic information offers an opportunity to determine the fine-grained travel patterns of people. Particularly, Strava Metro data offer a good opportunity for studies of recreational cycling behaviour as they can offer hourly, daily or annual cycling volumes with different purposes (commuting or recreational) in each street across a city. Therefore, in this study, we utilised Strava Metro data for investigating associations between environmental characteristics and recreational cycling behaviour at a large spatial scale (street level). In this study, we took account of population density, employment density, road length, road connectivity, proximity to public transit services, land use mix, proximity to green space, volume of motor vehicles and traffic accidents in an empirical investigation over Glasgow. Empirical results reveal that Strava cyclists are more likely to cycle for recreation on streets with short length, large connectivity or low volume of motor vehicles or on streets surrounded by residential land.},

The quality of these apps, in terms of applying established health behavior change techniques, remains unclear. Methods: The study sample was identified through systematic searches in iTunes and Google Play. Search terms were based on Boolean logic and included AND combinations for physical activity, healthy lifestyle, exercise, fitness, coach, assistant, motivation, and support. Sixty-four apps were downloaded, reviewed, and rated based on the taxonomy of behavior change techniques used in the interventions. Mean and ranges were calculated for the number of observed behavior change techniques. Using nonparametric tests, we compared the number of techniques observed in free and paid apps and in iTunes and Google Play. Results: On average, the reviewed apps included 5 behavior change techniques (range 2-8). Techniques such as self-monitoring, providing feedback on performance, and goal-setting were used most frequently, whereas some techniques such as motivational interviewing, stress management, relapse prevention, self-talk, role models, and prompted barrier identification were not. No differences in the number of behavior change techniques between free and paid apps, or between the app stores were found. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that apps promoting physical activity applied an average of 5 out of 23 possible behavior change techniques. This number was not different for paid and free apps or between app stores. The most frequently used behavior change techniques in apps were similar to those most frequently used in other types of physical activity promotion interventions.},

For example, recent research has shown that installation-time capability disclosures are ineffective in informing people about their apps’ location access.

Towards this end, we implemented a novel method to disclose location accesses by location-enabled apps on participants’ smartphones. In particular, the method did not need any changes to participants’ phones beyond installing our study app. We randomly divided our participants to two groups: a Disclosure group (N=13), who received our disclosures and a No Disclosure group (N=9) who received no disclosures from us. Our results confirm that the Android platform’s location access disclosure method does not inform participants effectively. Almost all participants pointed out that their location was accessed by several apps they would have not expected to access their location. Further, several apps accessed their location more frequently than they expected. We conclude that our participants appreciated the transparency brought by our run-time disclosures and that because of the disclosures most of them had taken actions to manage their apps’ location access.},

Walking and cycling have been transformed by digital technologies, which range from mapping apps for wayfinding, through ‘wearables’ which monitor activity, to social media apps for comparing activity within social groups. Some technologies are explicitly orientated to health projects, others are not, yet all have potentially profound effects on bodies, health-orientated identities, and understandings of health. This paper uses the concept of biomedicalisation to explore emerging literature on the intersection of digital technologies with everyday mobility, focusing on walking and cycling. Beyond simply ‘medicalising’ mobility (by bringing it into the realm of public health), digital technologies contribute to various transformations of health: encouraging some health practices, inhibiting others; creating or excluding individual and collective health-related identities; and reconfiguring health and well-being. There is research evidence on the contingent and multiple relationships between digital technologies and social practices, with specific themes including quantification; the role of apps in framing walking as extraordinary, cycling as competitive; enabling users to perform as healthy, neoliberal citizens; and digital careers. There has been less attention on how social divisions are reproduced or disrupted by the mediation of mobility through digital technologies. Further research should consider the impact of digital technologies on political economies of health.},

   abstract = {Estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) drive policy and planning decisions for surface transportation. No similar metric is computed for cycling and walking. What approaches could be used to compute such a metric on the state level? This report discusses three such approaches, identifies the advantages and disadvantages of each, and applies them to Washington State. The first approach employs travel survey data. The second approach is sample-based using pedestrian and bicycle count data. The third approach is an aggregate demand model approach using demographic data combined with count data. Due to data limitations, none of these methods could be properly implemented on the statewide level. Despite the data limits, the methods were implemented for one county (King County) in order to compare findings. The travel survey method estimated the lowest bicycle and pedestrian miles traveled (BMT and PMT), and the sample-based method estimated the highest. The travel survey method is useful for a statewide measure, but it does not provide the detail needed for facility-level estimates. For bicyclists, the sample-based method is appropriate if volumes are desired at the facility level. For pedestrians, the aggregate model might be more appropriate, because of the more dispersed nature of pedestrian travel. Each method has strengths and weaknesses, and each helps with understanding bicycle and pedestrian travel in different ways. For this reason, the project team recommends improving both statewide travel survey data and pedestrian and cyclist traffic count data which feed these methods. Travel survey data should be collected statewide with oversampling for non-motorized travelers. Pedestrian and cyclist traffic counts should be expanded to include a continuous counting program in addition to the short-duration count program. After the continuous count program is in place, short-duration counts should be chosen using a stratified random sampling approach. For example, the sampling frame could consist of all road and path segments in the state divided by region (Coast Range, Puget Lowland, Cascades, Eastern Washington), by urbanity (rural, urban), by facility type (highways/arterials, local/collector roads, paths), and by whether the location is on a bridge or not. To increase sites sampled, the short-duration count program could also be rotated, with each location being counted every three years instead of every year. Better data will allow the state to quantify bicycling and walking at both the state level and facility level to inform decision-making, facility design and planning, and safety analysis.},

   abstract = {Cycling volumes are necessary to understand what influences ridership and are essential for safety studies. Traditional methods of data collection are expensive, time consuming, and lack spatial and temporal detail. New sources have emerged as a result of crowdsourced data from fitness apps, allowing cyclists to track routes using GPS enabled cell phones. Our goal is to determine if crowdsourced data from fitness apps data can be used to quantify and map the spatial and temporal variation of ridership. Using data provided by Strava.com, we quantify how well crowdsourced fitness app data represent ridership through comparison with manual cycling counts in Victoria, British Columbia. Comparisons are made for hourly, AM and PM peak, and peak period totals that are separated by season. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a Generalized Linear Model we modelled the relationships between crowdsourced data from Strava and manual counts and predicted categories of ridership into low, medium, and high for all roadways in Victoria. Our results indicate a linear association (r2 0.40 to 0.58) between crowdsourced data volumes and manual counts, with one crowdsourced data cyclist representing 51 riders. Categorical cycling volumes were predicted and mapped using data on slope, traffic speeds, on street parking, time of year, and crowdsourced ridership with a predictive accuracy of 62%. Crowdsourced fitness data are a biased sample of ridership, however, in urban areas the high temporal and spatial resolution of data can predict categories of ridership and map spatial variation. Crowdsourced fitness apps offer a new source of data for transportation planning and can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of official count programs.},

   abstract = {Wildland fire managers in the United States currently utilize the gridded forecasts from the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) to make fire behavior predictions across complex landscapes during large wildfires. However, little is known about the NDFDs performance in remote locations with complex topography for weather variables important for fire behavior prediction, including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this study NDFD forecasts for calendar year 2015 were evaluated in fire-prone locations across the conterminous United States during periods with the potential for active fire spread using the model performance statistics of root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean fractional bias (MFB), and mean bias error (MBE). Results indicated that NDFD forecasts of air temperature and relative humidity performed well with RMSEs of about 28C and 10%-11%, respectively. However, wind speed was increasingly under-predicted when observed wind speeds exceeded about 4 m s 21 , with MFB and MBE values of approximately 215% and 20.5 m s 21 , respectively. The importance of accurate wind speed forecasts in terms of fire behavior prediction was confirmed, and the forecast accuracies needed to achieve ''good'' surface head fire rate-of-spread predictions were estimated as 620%-30% of the observed wind speed. Weather station location, the specific forecast office, and terrain complexity had the largest impacts on wind speed forecast error, although the relatively low variance explained by the model (;37%) suggests that other variables are likely to be important. Based on these results it is suggested that wildland fire managers should use caution when utilizing the NDFD wind speed forecasts if high wind speed events are anticipated.},

   abstract = {Physical activity is one of the best disease prevention strategies, and it is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to illuminate the relation between ambient temperature and bikeshare usage and to project how climate change-induced increasing ambient temperatures may influence active transportation in New York City. METHODS: The analysis leverages Citi Bike® bikeshare data to estimate participation in outdoor bicycling in New York City. Exposure–response functions are estimated for the relation between daily temperature and bike usage from 2013 to 2017. The estimated exposure–response relation is combined with temperature outputs from 21 climate models (run with emissions scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) to explore how climate change may influence future bike utilization. RESULTS: Estimated daily hours and distance ridden significantly increased as temperatures increased, but then declined at temperatures above 26–28°C. Bike usage may increase by up to 3.1% by 2070 due to climate change. Future ridership increases during the winter, spring, and fall may more than offset future declines in summer ridership. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggesting nonlinear impacts of rising temperatures on health-promoting bicycle ridership demonstrates how challenging it is to anticipate the health consequences of climate change. We project increases in bicycling by mid-century in NYC, but this trend may reverse as temperatures continue to rise further into the future. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4039.},

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the rate of exertional heat illness (EHI) among collegiate football athletes and to monitor environmental conditions during American football practice for a 3-month period. DESIGN Epidemiologic study in which we reviewed the occurrence rates of EHI and wet bulb globe temperature readings during a 3-month period of American collegiate football practice sessions. SETTING Five universities in the southeastern region of the United States. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Collegiate football players at the 5 universities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Wet bulb globe temperatures were recorded from August through October 2003, at the beginning, middle, and end of each practice session. The EHIs were identified and recorded, and athlete-exposures (AEs) were calculated. RESULTS A total of 139 EHIs and 33 196 AEs were reported (EHI rate = 4.19/1000 AEs). The highest incidence of EHIs was in August (88%, EHI rate = 8.95/1000 AEs) and consisted of 70% heat cramps (6.13/1000 AEs), 23% heat exhaustion (2.06/ 1000 AEs), and 7% heat syncope (0.58/1000 AEs). No cases of heat stroke or hyponatremia were identified. The highest risk of EHI occurred during the first 3 weeks of the study; mean wet bulb globe temperature declined significantly as the study continued ( P < .001). Temperatures in the final 5 weeks of the study were significantly cooler than in the first 5 weeks ( P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Heat cramps were the most common EHI and occurred most often during the first 3 weeks of practice. Athletic trainers should take all necessary preventive measures to reduce the risk of EHI.},

   abstract = {Heatwaves are associated with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat warning systems have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat warning systems. Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat warning systems at US$210,000 compared to the US$468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people's response to heat warning systems and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of the evidence suggests that heat warning systems are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat warning systems' measures and improving the utilization of the services.},

Unsuccessful marathon starters were plotted against the race start wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and the WBGT level at which a mass casualty incident (MCI) occurred was used to calculate a "do not start" WBGT. RESULTS A start WBGT of >21 degrees C resulted in MCI or midrace cancellation in several races.

The event experienced an area-wide MCI at a start WBGT of 22 degrees C with an unsuccessful starter rate of 160 per 1000 finishers. CONCLUSIONS Marathons in northern latitudes (>40 degrees) held in "unexpectedly" hot conditions when the participants are not acclimatized and the start WBGT is >21 degrees C often end in either race cancellation or an MCI.

   abstract = {Exertional heat illnesses affect thousands of athletes each year across the United States (U.S.). Heat safety guidelines such as those developed by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) are widely used to direct activities based on environmental conditions but rely on a uniform set of heat safety categories. Due to geographic variations in heat exposure and acclimatization, however, lower heat safety thresholds may be needed in areas with cooler climates. Our study addresses this shortcoming by developing regional guidelines for athletic activity that use relative thresholds of a commonly used heat metric -- the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT). We employed a unique WBGT climatology for the contiguous U.S. to determine locally extreme WBGTs, defined as the 90th percentile warm season daily maximum value, for 217 stations. Three heat safety regions were identified based on local extremes: Category 3 (WBGTs≥32.3°C), Category 2 (30.1-32.2°C), and Category 1 (≤30°C). Geographically, Category 3 encompasses much of the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. along with portions of the Southwest, and the Central Valley of California; Category 2 areas extend in an arc from the interior Northwest through Nevada and portions of the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast; and Category 1 locations include the Pacific Coast, New England, and the northern tier of the country. Associated regional activity guidelines based on those developed by the ACSM and the Georgia High School Association (GHSA) were developed for each heat safety region.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Extreme heat is a well-documented public health threat. The US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat advisories and warnings (collectively, “heat alerts”) in advance of forecast extreme heat events. The effectiveness of these alerts in preventing deaths remains largely unknown. 

OBJECTIVES
To quantify the change in mortality rates associated with heat alerts in 20 US cities between 2001 and 2006. 

METHODS
Because NWS heat alerts are issued based on forecast weather and these forecasts are imperfect, in any given location there exists a set of days of similar observed heat index in which heat alerts have been issued for some days but not others. We used a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to compare mortality rates on days with versus without heat alerts among such eligible days, adjusting for maximum daily heat index and temporal factors. We combined city-specific estimates into a summary measure using standard random-effects meta-analytic techniques. 

RESULTS
Overall, NWS heat alerts were not associated with lower mortality rates (percent change in rate: −0.5% [95% CI: -2.8, 1.9]). In Philadelphia, heat alerts were associated with a 4.4% (95% CI: -8.3, −0.3) lower mortality rate or an estimated 45.1 (95% empirical CI: 3.1, 84.1) deaths averted per year if this association is assumed to be causal. No statistically significant beneficial association was observed in other individual cities. 

CONCLUSIONS
Our results suggest that between 2001 and 2006, NWS heat alerts were not associated with lower mortality in most cities studied, potentially missing a valuable opportunity to avert a substantial number of heat-related deaths. These results highlight the need to better link alerts to effective communication and intervention strategies to reduce heat-related mortality.},

   abstract = {An accurate estimation of PM 2.5 (fine particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 μm) concentration is critical for health risk assessment and generating air pollution control strategies. In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach, named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM 2.5 concentrations, which integrates Random Forest (RF), one of machine learning (ML) models, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), one of remote sensing (RS) products. The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization of real-time spatiotemporal PM 2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships among a large number of meteorological, environmental and air pollutant factors, as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) during 2015–2017. Deep Blue (DB) AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 (C_61) aerosol products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is validated with Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM 2.5 concentrations. It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM 2.5 and relevant factors such as DB AOD, meteorological and air pollutant variables, but also can provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during haze periods.},

   abstract = {Many climate studies need to generate estimates of a climate variable at a given location based on values from other locations. In this research, a new method for the spatial interpolation of daily maximum surface air temperatures is presented. This new method uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate temperature estimates at 11 locations given information from a lattice of surrounding locations. The out-of-sample performance of the ANNs is evaluated relative to a variety of benchmark methods (spatial average, nearest neighbor, and inverse distance methods). The ANN approach is superior both in terms of predictive accuracy and model encompassing. In 94% of case comparisons, the predictive accuracy of the ANN is superior to the benchmark methods. The ANN approach encompasses the benchmark methods in 77% of case comparisons, while benchmark methods encompass the ANN in only 2%. In light of these results, the potential to use this new method of spatial interpolation to downscale GCM temperature simulations is discussed. © 2000 American Meteorological Society.},

This package was also compared with neural networks packages nnet and neuralnet available in software R Project. The entire packages uses multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model trained with the back propagation algorithm. Evaluation methods were based mainly on RMSE. All the tests were done on artificial data created in R Project software; which simulated three surfaces with different characteristics. In order to find the best configuration for the multilayer perceptron many different settings of network were tested (test-and-trial method). The number of neurons in hidden layers was the main tested parameter. Results indicate that MLP model in the ANN module implemented in GRASS can be used for spatial interpolation purposes. However the resulting RMSE was higher than RMSE from IDW and ordinary kriging method and time consuming. When compared neural network packages in GRASS GIS and R Project; it is better to use the packages in R Project. Training of MLP was faster in this case and results were the same or slightly better.},

Adverse weather is often cited as a reason why people do not cycle. This study investigated temporal and seasonal variability in cycle volume and its association with weather in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. Two datasets were used: automated cycle count data collected on Tamaki Drive in Auckland by using ZELT Inductive Loop Eco-counters and weather data (gust speed, rain, temperature, sunshine duration) available online from the National Climate Database. Analyses were undertaken using data collected over one year (1 January to 31 December 2009). Normalised cycle volumes were used in correlation and regression analyses to accommodate differences by hour of the day and day of the week and holiday. In 2009, 220,043 bicycles were recorded at the site. There were significant differences in mean hourly cycle volumes by hour of the day, day type and month of the year (p < 0.0001). All weather variables significantly influenced hourly and daily cycle volumes (p < 0.0001). The cycle volume increased by 3.2% (hourly) and 2.6% (daily) for 1°C increase in temperature but decreased by 10.6% (hourly) and 1.5% (daily) for 1 mm increase in rainfall and by 1.4% (hourly) and 0.9% (daily) for 1 km/h increase in gust speed. The volume was 26.2% higher in an hour with sunshine compared with no sunshine, and increased by 2.5% for one hour increase in sunshine each day. There are temporal and seasonal variations in cycle volume in Auckland and weather significantly influences hour-to-hour and day-to-day variations in cycle volume.

Kilimanjaro, the skill of 14 machine learning algorithms in predicting spatial temperature patterns is tested and evaluated against the heavily utilized kriging approach. Based on a 10-fold cross-validation testing design, regression trees generally perform better than linear and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by Cubist, random forest and model averaged neural networks which except for the latter are all regression tree-based algorithms. While these machine learning algorithms perform better than kriging in a quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the resulting air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist and residual kriging approach can be considered the best solution.},

Limited resources for monitoring reveal that bicycle travel patterns may constrain such understanding at the network level. This study examined the potential exposure of bicyclists to traffic-related air pollution in El Paso, Texas, using Strava Metro data that revealed bicycle patterns across the city networks. An initial spatial mapping analysis was conducted to explore the spatial patterns of bicycling and traffic pollutant emission, followed by exploratory descriptive statistics. A spatial bicycle model was then developed to explore factors influencing bicycling activity in El Paso. Analysis results indicated significant associations between greater bicycle volume and both higher levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and more frequent bus services, implying adverse health concerns related to traffic-related air pollution. The results also indicated significant effects of various environmental characteristics (e.g., roadway, bicycle infrastructure, topography, and demographics) on bicycling. The findings encourage extending this study to provide guidance to bicyclists whose regular trips take place on heavily trafficked roads and during rush hours in this region and to evaluate the net health impacts of on-road bicycling for the general population.</p>},

   abstract = {Citizens in urban areas are exposed to multiple environmental stressors like noise, heat, and air pollution, with impact on human health. There is a great deal of evidence that connects human health, objective environmental exposure, and place of residence. However, little is known about subjective and objective multiple personal exposures while being mobile. To address this research gap, this paper presents results from a mixed-methods exploratory study with cyclists in the City of Leipzig, Germany. In the summer of 2017, cyclists (n = 66) wore a unique combination of sensors that measured particle number counts (PNC), noise, humidity, temperature, geolocation, and the subjective perception of each exposure on everyday routes for one week (n = 730). A smartphone application was developed to question participants about their perception of subjective exposure. The data were analyzed with three aims: (i) to compare the multiple exposure profiles of the cyclists, (ii) to contrast the objective data and subjective individual perception, and (iii) to examine the role of route decision-making and awareness of health impacts for healthier route choices. The results indicate distinct differences between the exposure profiles of cyclists. Over 80% of the cyclists underestimated their exposure to noise and air pollution. Except for heat, no significant associations between the objective and subjective data were found. This reveals an exposure awareness gap that needs to be considered in urban health planning and risk communication. It is argued that knowledge about health impacts and route characteristics plays a crucial role in decision-making about route choices. The paper concludes with suggestions to harness smart sensing for exposure mitigation and research in health geography.},

The former forcing will remain relatively constant, but a WC will appear in the latter. WCs for specific times of day and the urban heat island (UHI) have not been analysed heretofore. We use three-hourly surface (2 m) temperature data to analyse the WCs of seven major Australian cities at different times of day and to determine to what extent one of our major city's (Melbourne) UHI exhibits a WC. We show that the WC of temperature in major cities differs according to the time of day and that the UHI intensity of Melbourne is affected on a WC.

   abstract = {Background: Occupational heat exposure is a serious concern for worker health, productivity, and the economy. Few studies in North America assess how on-site wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) levels and guidelines are applied in practice. Methods: We assessed the use of a WBGT sensor for localized summertime heat exposures experienced by outdoor laborers at an industrial worksite in Ontario, Canada during the warm season (May-October) from 2012 to 2018 inclusive. We further examined informed decision making, approximated workers’ predicted heat strain (sweat loss, core temperature), and estimated potential financial loss (via hourly wages) due to decreased work allowance in the heat. Results: Significantly higher worksite WBGT levels occured compared with regional levels estimated at the airport, with an upward trend in heat warnings over the 7 years and expansion of warnings into the fall season. The maximum WBGT during warnings related strongly to predicted hourly sweat loss. On average, 22 hours per worker were lost each summer (~1% of annual work hours) as a result of taking breaks or stopping due to heat. This amount of time corresponded to an average individual loss of C$1100 Canadian dollars (~C$220,000 combined for ~200 workers) to workers or the company. The additional losses for an enterprise due to reduced product output were not estimated. Conclusions: Worksite observations and actions at the microscale are essential for improving the estimates of health and economic costs of extreme heat to enterprises and society. Providing worksite heat metrics to the employees aids in appropriate decision making and health protection.},

Conventional LST-planar land-cover assessments do not explicitly address the vertical dimension of the “urbanscape” and therefore do not capture the heterogeneity of solar radiation exposure of planar surfaces adequately. Objectives: To fill this gap, this study compares and integrates novel spherical land-cover fractions derived from Google Street View (GSV) with the conventional planar land-cover fractions in estimating daytime and nighttime LST variations in the Phoenix metropolitan area, AZ. Methods: The GSV spherical dataset was created using big data and machine learning techniques. The planar land cover was classified from 1 m NAIP imagery. Ordinal least square (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to assess the relationship between LST and urban form (spherical and planar fractions) at the block group level. Social-demographic variables were also added provide the most comprehensive assessment of LST. Results: The GSV spherical fractions provide better LST estimates than the planar land-cover fractions, because they capture the multi-layer tree crown and vertical wall influences that are missing from the bird-eye view imagery. The GWR regression further improves model fit versus the OLS regression (R 2 increased from 0.6 to 0.8). Conclusions: GSV and spatial regression (GWR) approaches improve the specificity of LST identified by neighborhoods in Phoenix metro-area by accounting for shading. This place-specific information is critical for optimizing diverse cooling strategies to combat heat in desert cities.},

We evaluated whether place-based characteristics (socioeconomic/demographic and health factors, as well as the built and biophysical environment) may be associated with greater risk of heat-related mortality for seniors during heat events in NYC. As a measure of relative vulnerability to heat, we used the natural cause mortality rate ratio among those aged 65 and over (MRR65+), comparing extremely hot days (maximum heat index 100°F+) to all warm season days, across 1997-2006 for NYC's 59 Community Districts and 42 United Hospital Fund neighborhoods. Significant positive associations were found between the MRR65+ and neighborhood-level characteristics: poverty, poor housing conditions, lower rates of access to air-conditioning, impervious land cover, surface temperatures aggregated to the area-level, and seniors' hypertension. Percent Black/African American and household poverty were strong negative predictors of seniors' air conditioning access in multivariate regression analysis.},

   abstract = {Heat early warning systems and action plans use temperature thresholds to trigger warnings and risk communication. In this study, we conduct multistate analyses, exploring associations between heat and all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations, to inform the design and development of heat-health early warning systems. We used a two-stage analysis to estimate heat-health risk relationships between heat index and hospitalizations in 1,617 counties in the United States for 2003-2012. The first stage involved a county-level time series quasi-Poisson regression, using a distributed lag nonlinear model, to estimate heat-health associations. The second stage involved a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to pool county-specific exposure-response associations across larger geographic scales, such as by state or climate region. Using results from this two-stage analysis, we identified heat index ranges that correspond with significant heat-attributable burden. We then compared those with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service (NWS) heat alert criteria used during the same time period. Associations between heat index and cause-specific hospitalizations vary widely by geography and health outcome. Heat-attributable burden starts to occur at moderately hot heat index values, which in some regions are below the alert ranges used by the NWS during the study time period. Locally specific health evidence can beneficially inform and calibrate heat alert criteria. A synchronization of health findings with traditional weather forecasting efforts could be critical in the development of effective heat-health early warning systems. public health | extreme heat | public policy | evidence-based decision making | early warning systems E xtreme heat is an established hazard. Risk for a range of conditions is associated with extreme heat exposure (1, 2), including morbidity from heat illness (3), electrolyte and renal dysfunction (4, 5), and exacerbations of chronic respiratory (6) and cardiovascular (7) disease, as well as all-cause mortality (3). The association between the particular temperatures at which risks are manifested and the magnitude of the effects vary regionally due to acclimatization, air conditioning prevalence, demography , and other factors (8). Successful risk management varies by setting and includes prevention strategies ranging from engineering controls such as air conditioning, management controls such as shifts in work schedules and activity restrictions, and behavioral controls encouraged through heat early warning systems and action plans (9). These systems and plans are activities that link forecasts of heat exposure with risk communication and risk reduction activities aimed at reducing exposure and limiting adverse health impacts among the exposed such as cooling centers, neighbor check-ins, and maintenance of air conditioning availability (10), which have been linked with reduced morbidity and mortality. Given variability in temperature thresholds at which risks increase , one central consideration in heat early warning systems is the threshold at which warnings should be issued (11). Guidance recommends setting thresholds based on analysis of associations between heat exposure (measured using a variety of metrics) and adverse health effects (9). In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service (NWS) issues excessive heat watch, warning, and heat advisory alerts as weather conditions warrant. While NWS provides guidance to its Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) on appropriate thresholds for issuing these alerts, WFOs are encouraged to work with local officials to define locally appropriate alert thresholds (12). There is no standard protocol for incorporating local epidemiological analyses, as relevant data and expertise may not be locally available. In addition to these constraints, risk assessment has been complicated by a lack of consensus regarding exposure assessment (e.g., which temperature metrics to use), standardization of heat-sensitive health outcomes (e.g., morbidity measures or mortality) and resulting heat attributable health impacts, and standard analytical approaches , despite emerging consensus in the field that best practices include basing thresholds on recent time-series analyses of the relationship between temperature and the best available local health data (9, 13). Recent analyses have demonstrated Significance Heat early warning systems and action plans have been shown to reduce risks of heat exposure, and best practice recommends that plans be built around local epidemiologic evidence and emergency management capacity. This evaluation provides useful information for heat early warning system and action plan administrators regarding the temperature ranges at which health impacts are manifest, the morbidity outcomes most sensitive to heat, and alignment between alert thresholds and temperatures at which disease burden is most pronounced. The results suggest opportunities for improvement and for refinement of prevention messaging as well as coordination between meteorological and public health authorities at multiple levels before, during, and after periods of extreme heat.},

Taking the latter position, we argue here for the benefits of sustained integration of physical and critical human geography. For reasons both political and pragmatic, we term this area of intermingled research and practice critical physical geography (CPG). CPG combines critical attention to power relations with deep knowledge of biophysical science or technology in the service of social and environmental transformation. We argue that whether practiced by individuals or teams, CPG research can improve the intellectual quality and expand the political relevance of both physical and critical human geography because it is increasingly impractical to separate analysis of natural and social systems: socio-biophysical landscapes are as much the product of unequal power relations, histories of colonialism, and racial and gender disparities as they are of hydrology, ecology, and climate change. Here, we review existing CPG work; discuss the primary benefits of critically engaged integrative research, teaching, and practice; and offer our collective thoughts on how to make CPG work. © 2013 Canadian Association of Geographers / L' Association canadienne des géographes.},

Mortality from all internal causes of death did not have this association. Building thermal protection was not associated with mortality.

   abstract = {2 Summary The purpose of this paper is to present a tentative conceptual framework for studies of vulnerability and adaptation to climate variability and change, generally applicable to a wide range of contexts, systems and hazards. Social vulnerability is distinguished from biophysical vulnerability, which is broadly equivalent to the natural hazards concept of risk. The IPCC definition of vulnerability is discussed within this context, which helps us to reconcile apparently contradictory definitions of vulnerability. A concise typology of physically defined hazards is presented; the relationship between the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of a human system depends critically on the nature of the hazard faced. Adaptation by a system may be inhibited by process originating outside the system; it is therefore important to consider "external" obstacles to adaptation, and links across scales, when assessing adaptive capacity.},

The analysis is based on a conceptual framework in which risk is viewed in terms of outcome, and is a function of physically defined climate hazards and socially constructed vulnerability. Climate outcomes are represented by mortality from climate-related disasters, using the emergency events database data set, statistical relationships between mortality and a shortlist of potential proxies for vulnerability are used to identify key vulnerability indicators. We find that 11 key indicators exhibit a strong relationship with decadally aggregated mortality associated with climate-related disasters. Validation of indicators, relationships between vulnerability and adaptive capacity, and the sensitivity of subsequent vulnerability assessments to different sets of weightings are explored using expert judgement data, collected through a focus group exercise. The data are used to provide a robust assessment of vulnerability to climate-related mortality at the national level, and represent an entry point to more detailed explorations of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. They indicate that the most vulnerable nations are those situated in sub-Saharan Africa and those that have recently experienced conflict.

The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is widely used as a heat stress metric in athletics for adjusting activities. The WBGT can be measured on-site with portable sensors, but instrument cost may provide a barrier for usage. Modeling WBGT from weather station data, then, presents an affordable option. Our study compares two WBGT models of varying levels of sophistication: the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM) model which uses only temperature and humidity as inputs and a physically based model by Liljegren that incorporates temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation in determining WBGT outputs. The setting for the study is 19 University of Georgia Weather Network stations selected from across the state of Georgia, USA, over a 6-year period (2008–2014) during late summer and early fall months. Results show that the ABM model’s performance relative to the Liljegren model varies based on time of day and weather conditions. WBGTs from the ABM model are most similar to those from the Liljegren model during midday when the assumption of moderately high sun most frequently occurs. We observed increasingly large positive biases with the ABM model both earlier and later in the day during periods with lower solar radiation. Even during midday, large (≥ 3 °C) underestimates may occur during low wind conditions and overestimates during periods with high cloud cover. Such differences can lead to inaccurate activity modification and pose dangers for athletes either by underestimating heat-related hazards or by imposing an opportunity cost if practice activities are limited by overestimating the heat hazard.},

The authors found that ABM tends to overestimate WBGT than Liljegren’s model. For example, Liljegren’s model indicated less than category 6 and ABM model estimate more than 6 categories which restrict outdoor activities. <br/>Liljegren’s model is well known for the most accurate model.

Urbanization and global climate change threaten to exacerbate heat as an already significant environmental cause of human morbidity and mortality. Despite increasing risk, very little is known regarding determinants of outdoor urban heat exposure. To provide additional evidence for building community and national-scale resilience to extreme heat, we assess how US outdoor urban heat exposure varies by city, demography, and activity. We estimate outdoor urban heat exposure by pairing individual-level data from the American Time Use Survey (2004–2015) with corresponding meteorological data for 50 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the US. We also assess the intersection of activity intensity and heat exposure by pairing metabolic intensities with individual-level time-use data. We model an empirical relationship between demographic indicators and daily heat exposure with controls for spatiotemporal factors. We find higher outdoor heat exposure among the elderly and low-income individuals, and lower outdoor heat exposure in females, young adults, and those identifying as Black race. Traveling, lawn and garden care, and recreation are the most common outdoor activities to contribute to heat exposure. We also find individuals in cities with the most extreme temperatures do not necessarily have the highest outdoor heat exposure. The findings reveal large contrasts in outdoor heat exposure between different cities, demographic groups, and activities. Resolving the interplay between exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and behavior as determinants of heat-health risk will require advances in observational and modeling tools, especially at the individual scale.},

   abstract = {Daily mortality is typically higher on hot days in urban areas, and certain population groups experience disproportionate risk. Air conditioning (AC) has been recommended to mitigate heat-related illness and death. We examined whether AC prevalence explained differing heat-related mortality effects by race. Poisson regression was used to model daily mortality in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh. Predictors included natural splines of time (to control seasonal patterns); mean daily apparent temperature on the day of death, and averaged over lags 1-3; barometric pressure; day of week; and a linear term for airborne particles. Separate, city-specific models were fit to death counts stratified by race (Black or White) to derive the percent change in mortality at 29°C, relative to 15°C (lag 0). Next, city-specific effects were regressed on city- and race-specific AC prevalence. Combined effect estimates across all cities were calculated using inverse variance-weighted averages. Prevalence of central AC among Black households was less than half that among White households in all four cities, and deaths among Blacks were more strongly associated with hot temperatures. Central AC prevalence explained some of the differences in heat effects by race, but room-unit AC did not. Efforts to reduce disparities in heat-related mortality should consider access to AC. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the New York Academy of Medicine.

Climate change models forecast increasing US temperatures and more frequent heat wave events in the coming years. Exposure to environmental heat is a significant, but overlooked, workplace hazard that has not been well-characterized or studied. The working population is diverse; job function, age, fitness level, and risk factors to heat-related illnesses vary. Yet few studies have examined or characterized the incidence of occupational heat-related morbidity and mortality. There are no federal regulatory standards to protect workers from environmental heat exposure.

Methods: The outcomes were daily person-based frequencies of EHI and AI. Exposures were maximum estimated WBGT (WBGTmax) and severity. Previous day's cumulative effect was assessed by introducing previous day's WBGTmax into the model. Results: EHI and AI were higher in workers exposed above a WBGTmax of 20°C (RR 1.40 and RR 1.06/°C, respectively). Exposures above 28°C-WBGTmax on the day of the EHI and/or the day before were associated with higher risk of EHI due to an interaction between previous day's environmental conditions and the current day (RRs from 1.0–10.4). Conclusions: The risk for EHI and AI were higher with increasing WBGTmax. There was evidence of a cumulative effect from the prior day's WBGTmax for EHI. Am. J. Ind.

This paper describes the epidemiological characteristics of heat-related deaths among workers in the US 2000-2010. Methods: Fatality data were obtained at the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the confidential on-site Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries database. Fatality rates and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by year, sex, age group, ethnicity, race, state, and industry. Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 359 occupational heat-related deaths were identified in the U.S., for a yearly average fatality rate of 0.22 per 1 million workers. Highest rates were found among Hispanics, men, the agriculture and construction industries, the state of Mississippi, and very small establishments. Conclusions: This study provides the first comprehensive national profile of heat-related deaths in the U.S. workplace. Prevention efforts should be directed at small businesses and at industries and individuals with the highest risk.},

Second, using health care settings, public health and environmental health as illustrations, arguments that interpret and explain health and health care in different ways. A final series of discussions takes the theme of arguments further in terms of how they might affect change in the world. Specifically, health geography is situated within four broad movements currently unfolding in the larger disciplines to which it contributes.

   abstract = {Adolescent judo athletes who train in tropical climates may be in a persistent state of dehydration because they frequently restrict fluids during daily training sessions to maintain or reduce their body weight and are not given enough opportunities to drink. Purpose: Determine the body hydration status of adolescent judo athletes before, immediately after, and 24 h after (24H) a training session and document sweat Na + loss and symptoms of dehydration. Methods: Body mass and urine color and specific gravity (USG) were measured before, after, and 24 h after a training session in a high-heat-stress environment (29.5 ± 1.0°C; 77.7 ± 6.1% RH) in 24 adolescent athletes. Sweat sodium loss was also determined. A comparison was made between mid-pubertal (MP) and late pubertal (LP) subjects. Results: The majority of the subjects started training with a significant level of dehydration. During the training session, MP subjects lost 1.3 ± 0.8% of their pretrain-ing body mass whereas LP subjects lost 1.9 ± 0.5% (P < .05). Sweat sodium concentration was 44.5 ± 23.3 mmol/L. Fluid intake from a water fountain was minimal. Subjects reported symptoms of dehydration during the session, which in some cases persisted throughout the night and the next day. The 24H USG was 1.028 ± 0.004 and 1.027 ± 0.005 g/mL for MP and LP, respectively. Conclusions: Adolescent judo athletes arrive to practice with a fluid deficit, do not drink enough during training, and experience symptoms of dehydration, which may compromise the quality of training and general well-being.},

Accordingly, besides poor hydration status, the primary determinants of reduced performance and exertional heat-illness risk in youth during sports and other physical activities in a hot environment include undue physical exertion, insufficient recovery between repeated exercise bouts or closely scheduled same-day training sessions or rounds of sports competition, and inappropriately wearing clothing, uniforms, and protective equipment that play a role in excessive heat retention.

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The joint collaboration of institutional agencies and multidisciplinary approaches is essential for a successful development of heat-health warning systems and action plans which can reduce the impacts of extreme heat on the population. The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature, web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires. The aim of this study is to pave the way for future heat-health warning systems, such as the one currently under development in the framework of the Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project. Some aspects are highlighted among the variety of examined European warning systems. The meteorological variables that trigger the warnings should present a clear link with the impact under consideration and should be chosen depending on the purpose and target of the warnings. Setting long-term planning actions as well as pre-alert levels might prevent and reduce damages due to heat. Finally, education and communication are key elements of the success of a warning system.},

   abstract = {In the past five years, the southern region of the United States has had a large number of fatal tornadoes. Previous research indicates that residents of this area may not be taking appropriate shelter. The present study uses a random sample of Tennessee residents (N = 1126) and the latent class analysis (LCA) technique to explore discrete types of responders according to their pattern of intended behaviors when presented with a tornado warning scenario in the daytime or nighttime. LCA revealed three distinct groups in the day subsample – Tech Users, Typical Actors, and Passive Reactors – and three in the night subsample – Tech Users, Typical Actors, and Non-Reactors. Being a Tech User or Typical Actor was positively associated with intending to seek safe shelter, although being a Passive Reactor or Non-Reactor was not. Further, Tech Users/Typical Actors were seeking and obtaining more warning information from other sources compared to Passive Reactors/Non-Reactors. While few demographic variables were associated with class assignment, bivariate and multivariate analyses illustrated that cognitive factors, such as previous experience with tornadoes and perceived accuracy of warnings, are significantly associated with class membership when controlling for non-cognitive factors. The distinctions made within and between the subsamples can support the National Weather Service's efforts to better target the public with future messages about tornado safety as well as guide researchers on future studies.},

   abstract = {Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States. Many individuals, however, fail to perceive this risk, which will be exacerbated by global warming. Given that awareness of one’s physical and social vulnerability is a critical precursor to preparedness for extreme weather events, understanding Americans’ perceptions of heat risk and their geographic variability is essential for promoting adaptive behaviors during heat waves. Using a large original survey dataset of 9,217 respondents, we create and validate a model of Americans’ perceived risk to their health from extreme heat in all 50 US states, 3,142 counties, and 72,429 populated census tracts. States in warm climates (e.g., Texas, Nevada, and Hawaii) have some of the highest heat-risk perceptions, yet states in cooler climates often face greater health risks from heat. Likewise, places with older populations who have increased vulnerability to health effects of heat tend to have lower risk perceptions, putting them at even greater risk since lack of awareness is a barrier to adaptive responses. Poorer neighborhoods and those with larger minority populations generally have higher risk perceptions than wealthier neighborhoods with more white residents, consistent with vulnerability differences across these populations. Comprehensive models of extreme weather risks, exposure, and effects should take individual perceptions, which motivate behavior, into account. Understanding risk perceptions at fine spatial scales can also support targeting of communication and education initiatives to where heat adaptation efforts are most needed.},

   abstract = {In the United Kingdom, the Met Office issues regionally calibrated impact-based weather warnings. These aim to reduce harm to people and property. To decrease risk from severe weather, it is important to understand how members of the U.K. public interpret and act on these warnings. This paper addresses this through a postevent survey (n = 552) conducted following Storm Doris, a 2017 winter storm during which wind warnings were issued across much of the United Kingdom. Survey questions examined 1) understanding of impact-based wind warnings, 2) interpretation of local warning level, 3) predictors of perceived local risk (likelihood, impact severity, concern) implied by warnings, 4) predictors of trust in the forecast, and 5) predictors of recalled and anticipated action. Our findings indicate that U.K. residents generally understand that weather warnings are based on potential weather impacts, although many do not realize warnings are regionally calibrated. We also find that while local warning levels are rarely underestimated, they may sometimes be overestimated. Institutional trust in the Met Office and perceived vulnerability to weather predict both perceived risk and behavioral response, while warning ‘‘understandability’’ is linked to greater trust in the forecast. Strikingly, while differences in local warning levels influenced risk perception, they did not affect recalled or intended behavioral response. This study highlights the importance of institutional trust in the effective communication of severe weather warnings, and a need for education on impact-based weather warnings. Above all, it demonstrates the need for further exploration of the effect of weather warnings on protective behavior.},

It was found that different target groups (e.g. the elderly, students) use different modes of media to obtain their severe weather information. It is recommended that forecast centres tailor their advisories for specific media sources so as best to reach various target groups. It was also found that respondents are generally satisfied with the weather warnings they receive, but there is a lack of awareness of the existence and extent of public vulnerability in Nova Scotia.

   abstract = {The reef crests of the Jardines de la Reina National Park (JRNP) are largely formed by Acropora palmata, but colonies of A. cervicornis and the hybrid A. prolifera are also present. This study shows spatial distribution of colonies, thickets and live fragments of these species in the fore reefs. Snorkeling was used to perform the direct observations. The maximum diameter of 4,399 colonies of A. palmata was measured and the health of 3,546 colonies was evaluated. The same was done to 168 colonies of A. cervicornis and 104 colonies of A. prolifera. The influence of the location and marine currents on a number of living colonies of A. palmata was analyzed. For such purpose, reef crests were divided into segments of 500 m. The marine park was divided into two sectors: East and West. The Caballones Channel was used as the reference dividing line. The park was also divided into five reserve zones. We counted 7,276 live colonies of Acropora spp. 1.4% was A. prolifera, 3.5% A. cervicornis and 95.1% A. palmata. There were 104 thickets of A. palmata, ranging from eight to 12 colonies, and 3,495 fragments; 0.6% was A. cervicornis and the rest A. palmata (99.4%). In the East sector, 263 colonies (3.8% of the total), six thickets (5.8%) and 32 fragments (1%) of A. palmate were recorded. In the same sector, there were 11 fragments (50%) of A.cervicornis and two (2%) colonies of A. prolifera. Health of A. palmata was evaluated as good and not so good in the study area. Health of A. cervicornis was critical and health of A. prolifera was good in all five reserve zones. There was a significant increase in the number of colonies from east to west (×2 = 11.5, gl = 3.0, p = 0.009). This corroborates the existence of an important abundance differences between the eastern and the western region of the JRNP. A negative relationship was observed between the number of colonies and the distance from the channel (×2 = 65.0, df = 3.0, p < 0.001). The influence of the channel, for the live colonies of A. palmata is greater within the first 2,000 m. It then decreases until approximately 6,000 m, and no significant increase beyond. The orientation of the reef crests significantly influenced the abundance of the colonies (×2 = 15.5, df = 2.9, p = 0.001). The results presented here provide a baseline for future research on the status of the populations of Acropora spp., considering that there has been a certain recovery of the species A. palmata during the last 10-16 years. Given the current status of the populations of Acropora spp., conservation actions focusing A. cervicornis should be prioritized.},

   abstract = {Epidemiology, sociology, and geography have been successful in re-establishing interest in the role of place in shaping health and health inequalities. However, some of the relevant empirical research has relied on rather conventional conceptions of space and place and focused on isolating the "independent" contribution of place-level and individual-level factors. This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of 'place' to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates 'relational', views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, 'contextually sensitive' policy interventions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Biogeography is spatial by nature. Over the past 20years, the literature related to the analysis of spatially structured data has exploded, much of it focused on a perceived problem of spatial autocorrelation and ways to deal with it. However, there are a number of other issues that permeate the biogeographical and macroecological literature that have become entangled in the spatial autocorrelation web. In this piece I discuss some of the assumptions that are often made in the analysis of spatially structured data that can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of spatial data, the methods used to analyse them, and how results can be interpreted. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We briefly review recent historical trends in the study of the effects of place on health in industrial countries, and argue that "place effects" often appear to have the status of a residual category, an unspecified black box of somewhat mystical influences on health which remain after investigators have controlled for a range of individual and place characteristics. We note that the distinction between "composition" and "context" may be more apparent than real, and that features of both material infrastructure and collective social functioning may influence health. We suggest using a framework of universal human needs as a basis for thinking about how places may influence health, and recommend the testing of hypotheses about specific chains of causation that might link place of residence with health outcomes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This chapter is devoted to exploring poverty in relation to climate change, a novelty in the IPCC. It uses a livelihood lens to assess the interactions between climate change and multiple dimensions of poverty. We use the term "the poor," not to homogenize, but to describe people living in poverty, people facing multiple deprivations, and the socially and economically disadvantaged, as part of a conceptualization broader than income-based measures of poverty, acknowledging gradients of prosperity and poverty. This livelihood lens also reveals how inequalities perpetuate poverty to shape differential vulnerabilities and in turn the differentiated impacts of climate change on individuals and societies. The chapter first presents the concepts of livelihoods, poverty, and inequality, and their relationships to each other and to climate change. Second, it describes observed impacts of weather events and climate on livelihoods and rural and urban poor people as well as projected impacts up to 2100. We use "weather events and climate" as an umbrella term for climate change, climate variability, and extreme events, and also highlight subtle shifts in precipitation and localized weather events. Third, this chapter discusses impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation responses on livelihoods and poverty. Finally, it outlines implications for poverty alleviation efforts and climate-resilient development pathways. Livelihoods and Poverty is a new chapter in the AR5. Although the WGII AR4 contributions mentioned poverty, as one of several non-climatic factors contributing to vulnerability, as a serious obstacle to effective adaptation, and in the context of endemic poverty in Africa (Chapters 7, 8, 18, 20), no systematic assessment was undertaken.},

   abstract = {Introduction This chapter examines what is known about the effects of climate change on human health and, briefly, the more direct impacts of climate-altering pollutants (CAPs; see Glossary) on health. We review diseases and other aspects of poor health that are sensitive to weather and climate. We examine the factors that influence the susceptibility of populations and individuals to ill health due to variations in weather and climate, and describe steps that may be taken to reduce the impacts of climate change on human health. The chapter also includes a section on health "co-benefits." Co-benefits are positive effects on human health that arise from interventions to reduce emissions of those CAPs that warm the planet or vice versa. This is a scientific assessment based on best available evidence according to the judgment of the authors. We searched the English-language literature up to August 2013, focusing primarily on publications since 2007. We drew primarily (but not exclusively) on peer-reviewed journals. Literature was identified using a published protocol (Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012) and other approaches, including extensive consultation with technical experts in the field. We examined recent substantial reviews (e.g., Gosling et al., 2009; Bassil and Cole, 2010; Hajat et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; McMichael, 2013b; Stanke et al., 2013) to check for any omissions of important work. In selecting citations for the chapter, we gave priority to publications that were recent (since AR4), comprehensive, added significant new findings to the literature, and included areas or population groups that have not previously been well described or were judged to be particularly policy relevant in other respects. We begin with an outline of measures of human health, the major driving forces that act on health worldwide, recent trends in health status, and health projections for the remainder of the 21st century. 11.1.1. Present State of Global Health The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) pointed to dramatic improvement in life expectancy in most parts of the world in the 20th century, and this trend has continued through the first decade of the 21st century (Wang et al., 2012).},

Deep cuts in emissions must be made rapidly to avoid warming of 2° above preindustrial levels but this is most unlikely, given present trends. It is possible that warming may in fact reach 4°C or more by 2100. Risks to health result principally from the effects of climate change on local food production, severity and frequency of storms and floods, threats to water supplies, and the direct effects of heat. The health sector has an important role protecting health in times of climate change. However, other sectors must be involved as well-steps taken in agriculture, urban planning, water and civil defence, for instance, will have implications for prevention of illness and injury. We offer a framework for planning adaptation, taking into account present climate-sensitive health problems, control options, and constraints. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {There is near consensus in the scientific community that humans will experience higher future temperatures due to the ongoing accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The human response to this climatic change, particularly if accompanied by a surge in extreme heat events, is a key topic being addressed by scientists across many disciplines. In this article, we review recent (2012-2015) research on human health impacts of observed and projected increases in summer temperature. We find that studies based on projected changes in climate indicate substantial increases in heat-related mortality and morbidity in the future, while observational studies based on historical climate and health records show a decrease in negative impacts during recent warming. The discrepancy between the two groups of studies generally involves how well and how quickly humans can adapt to changes in climate via physiological, behavioral, infrastructural , and/or technological adaptation, and how such adaptation is quantified.},

   abstract = {The question of truth stands at the core of Foucault's philosophy. He was interested in how different pieces of knowledge had attained truth status over the course of history, how power had legitimated itself through truth, how people had shaped themselves via producing truth. The multivolume History of Sexuality, conceived in the 1970s, was originally intended as a study of the relationship between sex and truth. This project that spread over almost ten years constituted Foucault's main laboratory of the history of truth, where he could test new concepts, ideas, and materials. The project went through a very important transformation in time: while in 1970s, Foucault was primarily interested in the relations between truth, sex and power, in the 1980s he mainly studies the relations between truth, sex and the subject. Looking back at the evolution of his thought in the second volume of his History of Sexuality, Foucault admits to realising that all of his work has in fact been dealing with the history of truth: “I seem to have gained a better perspective on the way I worked – gropingly, and by means of different or successive fragments – on this project, whose goal is a history of truth.”},

   abstract = {Over the coming century, climate change is projected to increase both mean and extreme temperatures as heat waves become more frequent, intense, and long-lived. The city of Chicago has already experienced a number of severe heat waves, with a 1995 event estimated to be responsible for nearly 800 deaths. Here, future projections under SRES higher (A1FI) and lower (B1) emission scenarios are used to estimate the frequency of 1995-like heat wave events in terms of both meteorological characteristics and impacts on heat-related mortality. Before end of century, 1995-like heat waves could occur every other year on average under lower emissions and as frequently as three times per year under higher. Annual average mortality rates are projected to equal those of 1995 under lower emissions and reach twice 1995 levels under higher. An "analog city" analysis, transposing the weather conditions from the European Heat Wave of 2003 (responsible for 70,000 deaths across Europe) to the city of Chicago, estimates that if a similar heat wave were to occur over Chicago, more than ten times the annual average number of heat-related deaths could occur in just a few weeks. Climate projections indicate that an EHW-type heat wave could occur in Chicago by mid-century. Between mid-and end-of-century, there could be as many as five such events under lower, and twenty-five under higher emissions. These results highlight the importance of both preventive mitigation and responsive adaptation strategies in reducing the vulnerability of Chicago's population to climate change-induced increases in extreme heat.},

   abstract = {Objectives. We sought to project future impacts of climate change on summer heat-related premature deaths in the New York City metropolitan region. Methods. Current and future climates were simulated over the northeastern United States with a global-to-regional climate modeling system. Summer heat-related premature deaths in the 1990s and 2050s were estimated by using a range of scenarios and approaches to modeling acclimatization (e.g., increased use of air conditioning, gradual physiological adaptation). Results. Projected regional increases in heat-related premature mortality by the 2050s ranged from 47% to 95%, with a mean 70% increase compared with the 1990s. Acclimatization effects reduced regional increases in summer heat-related premature mortality by about 25%. Local impacts varied considerably across the region, with urban counties showing greater numbers of deaths and smaller percentage increases than less-urbanized counties. Conclusions. Although considerable uncertainty exists in climate forecasts and future health vulnerability, the range of projections we developed suggests that by midcentury, acclimatization may not completely mitigate the effects of climate change in the New York City metropolitan region, which would result in an overall net increase in heat-related premature mortality. relatively coarse spatial scales. A global climate model applied in the United Kingdom projected a 250% increase in annual heat-related deaths by the 2050s across 4 greenhouse gas scenarios. 16 With a high-emission-change scenario in 6 temperate Australian cities, a 75% increase in annual heat-related mortality among people 65 years and older by 2050 was projected. 17 A study in Portugal projected that summer heat-related deaths in Lisbon may increase by up to 6 times by the 2050s. 18 A regional impacts study of Califor-nia concluded that by the latter decades of the 21st century, summer heat-related mortality could be 2 to 7 times greater than it is now, even after taking possible heat acclimatization (e.g., increased use of air conditioning, gradual physiological adaptation) into account. 19 General circulation models are global scale models that take into account the dynamics of physical processes in the atmosphere and oceans but at relatively coarse resolution. Hence, one cannot realistically use these models to address the need for locally relevant projections of the potential effects of global warming on public health. One approach to address this limitation is dynamical downscal-ing, in which the general circulation model outputs are used as initial and boundary conditions for finer-scale simulations by regional climate models. We used such a system, developed by the New York Climate and Health Project, 20 to project daily mean temperatures at local scales for the 2050s and to evaluate potential impacts of climate change on summer heat-related mortality in the New York City metropolitan region.},

Treating socioeconomic status (SES) and race as contextual factors, we examine characteristics of the environments of community, work, family, and peer interaction for predictors of positive and adverse health outcomes across the lifespan. We consider chronic stress/allostatic load, mental distress, coping skills and resources, and health habits and behaviors as classes of mechanisms that address how unhealthy environments get "under the skin," to create health disorders. Across multiple environments, unhealthy environments are those that threaten safety, that undermine the creation of social ties, and that are conflictual, abusive, or violent. A healthy environment, in contrast, provides safety, opportunities for social integration, and the ability to predict and/or control aspects of that environment.},

This pilot study investigated the indoor environments of people receiving emergency medical care in New York City, NY, U.S., from July to August 2013. The first objective was to determine the relative influence of outdoor conditions as well as patient characteristics and neighborhood sociodemographics on indoor temperature and specific humidity (N = 764). The second objective was to determine whether cardiovascular or respiratory cases experience hotter and more humid indoor conditions as compared to controls. Paramedics carried portable sensors into buildings where patients received care to passively monitor indoor temperature and humidity. The case–control study compared 338 respiratory cases, 291 cardiovascular cases, and 471 controls. Intuitively, warmer and sunnier outdoor conditions increased indoor temperatures. Older patients who received emergency care tended to occupy warmer buildings. Indoor-specific humidity levels quickly adjusted to outdoor conditions. Indoor heat and humidity exposure above a 26 °C threshold increased (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.98–2.68, P = 0.056), but not significantly, the proportion of respiratory cases.

   abstract = {This review discusses human thermoregulation during exercise and the measurement of body temperature in clinical and exercise settings. The thermoregulatory mechanisms play important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis during rest and physical exercise. Physical exertion poses a challenge to thermoregulation by causing a substantial increase in metabolic heat production. However, within a non-thermolytic range, the thermoregulatory mechanisms are capable of adapting to sustain physiological functions under these conditions. The central nervous system may also rely on hyperthermia to protect the body from "overheating." Hyperthermia may serve as a self-limiting signal that triggers central inhibition of exercise performance when a temperature threshold is achieved. Exposure to sub-lethal heat stress may also confer tolerance against higher doses of heat stress by inducing the production of heat shock proteins, which protect cells against the thermolytic effects of heat. Advances in body temperature measurement also contribute to research in thermoregulation. Current evidence supports the use of oral temperature measurement in the clinical setting, although it may not be as convenient as tympanic temperature measurement using the infrared temperature scanner. Rectal and oesophagus temperatures are widely accepted surrogate measurements of core temperature (Tc), but they cause discomfort and are less likely to be accepted by users. Gastrointestinal temperature measurement using the ingestible temperature sensor provides an acceptable level of accuracy as a surrogate measure of Tc without causing discomfort to the user. This form of Tc measurement also allows Tc to be measured continuously in the field and has gained wider acceptance in the last decade.},

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the threshold HRI symptom for deciding to take simple preventative actions both by the individual workers and employers. Method: A total of 328 municipal workers were enrolled in April to March 2016 were asked to recall if they experienced eleven HRI symptoms during the previous work day. Rasch Measurement Model was used to examine the unidimensional parameters and bias for gender before identifying the threshold of HRI symptoms. We determined the threshold symptom based on the person-item map distribution on a logit ruler value. Results: A total of 320 respondents were analysed. The psychometric features HRI symptoms suggested evidence of unidimensionality and free of bias for gender (DIF size =0.57; DIF t value =1.03). Based on the person-item map distribution, the thirst item was determined as the threshold item (Cut-off point =-2.17 logit) for the preventative action purposes to group the person as mild and moderate/severe HRI groups. Conclusion: Thirst item is viewed as threshold symptoms between mild and moderate or severe HRI symptoms. It is a reliable symptom to initiate behavioural response to quench the thirst by adequate fluids. Failure to recognise the thirst symptom may lead to devastating unwanted health complications.},

   abstract = {Daily weather conditions for an entire city are usually represented by a single weathe rstation, often located at a nearby airport. This resolution of atmospheric data fails to recognize the microscale climatic variability associated with land use decisions across and within urban neighborhoods. This study uses heat index, a measure of the combined effects of temperature and humidity, to assess the variability of heat exposure from ten weather stations across four urban neighborhoods and two control locations (downtown and in a nearby nature center) in Knoxville, Tennessee, USA. Results suggest that trees may negate a portion of excess urban heat, but are also associated with greater humidity. As a result, the heat index of locations with more trees is significantly higher than downtown and areas with fewer trees. Trees may also reduce heat stress by shading individuals from incoming radiation, though this is not considered in this study. Greater amounts of impervious surfaces correspond with reduced evapotranspiration and greater runoff, in terms of overall mass balance, leading to a higher temperature, but lower relative humidity. Heat index and relative humidity were found to significantly vary between locations with different tree cover and neighborhood characteristics for the full study time period as well as for the top 10% of heat index days. This work demonstrates the need for high-resolution climate data and the use of additional measures beyond temperature to understand urban neighborhood exposure to extreme heat, and expresses the importance of considering vulnerability differences among residents when analyzing neighborhood-scale impacts.},

   abstract = {In the post-1996 welfare reform period in the U.S., disability assistance has become a significant source of government aid for low-income residents as other forms of public support have faced considerable reductions and restrictions. In order to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) - a means-tested assistance program that provides income stipends to qualified residents - working-age individuals with disabilities must have little income and resources, and procure medical documentation that confirms that they are unable to work due to a disability. The result of rising SSI enrollment in the face of cutbacks to other government programs is the increasing medicalization of welfare, whereby receipt of welfare benefits is contingent on a medical diagnosis of disability. Using county-level data from the American Community Survey and the Social Security Administration, this paper examines the changing spatial patterns of SSI participation of the working-age population in 2000 and 2010 across the U.S. in addition to the interconnections between disability, welfare, and poverty. Results from spatial analyses illustrate geographic variation in SSI prevalence, with distinctive spatial clusters of higher than average SSI participation in the southeast and Appalachian regions of the U.S. and in northern California. Multiple linear regression model results reveal that SSI participation is significantly correlated with disability, poverty, race, family type, and level of education in both 2000 and 2010. The findings suggest that spatial concentrations of disability, poverty, and underemployment persist in largely rural areas. The discussion explores the potential social and economic implications of long-term SSI clustering on localities and residents, and points to future research directions.},

Upper-level governments are well positioned to create an enabling environment for adaptation and build local public health authorities' capacity, yet adaptation literature has not specified how upper-level governments can build local-level adaptive capacity. In this paper we examine how federal and regional governments can contribute to enabling and supporting public health adaptation to climate change at the local level in federal systems. We outline the local level's self-assessed adaptive capacity for public health adaptation in Canadian and German comparative case studies, in terms of funding, knowledge and skills, organizations, and prioritization, drawing upon 30 semi-structured interviews. Based on interviewees' recommendations and complemented by scientific literature, we develop a set of practical measures that could enable or support local-level public health adaptation. We find that adaptive capacity varies widely between local public health authorities, but most report having insufficient funding and staff for adaptation activities. We propose 10 specific measures upper-level governments can take to build local public health authorities' capacity for adaptation, under the interrelated target areas of: building financial capital; developing and disseminating usable knowledge; collaborating and coordinating for shared knowledge; and claiming leadership. Federal and regional governments have an important role to play in enabling local-level public health adaptation, and have many instruments available to them to fulfill that role. Selecting and implementing measures to enable local public health authorities' adaptive capacity will require tailoring to, and consideration, of the local context and needs.},

We aimed to quantify the association between ambient temperature variation and stroke, according to clinical characteristics of the events, and other risk factors for stroke. Methods We conducted a case-crossover study based on a 1-year registry of the hospital admissions due to newly occurring ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke events in Maputo, Mozambique's capital city (N = 593). The case-period was defined as the 7 days before the stroke event, which was compared to two control periods (14-21 days and 21-28 days before the event). We computed humidity- and precipitation-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using conditional logistic regression. Results An association between minimum temperature declines higher than 2.4 °C in any two consecutive days in the previous week and the occurrence of stroke was observed only for first events (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.76). Stronger and statistically significant associations were observed for hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.07-2.09) and among subjects not exposed to risk factors, including smoking, high serum cholesterol or atrial fibrillation. No differences in the effect of temperature were found according to the patients' vital status 28 days after the event. Conclusions First stroke events, especially of the hemorrhagic type, were triggered by declines in the minimum temperature between consecutive days of the preceding week.},

   abstract = {Background: The time stratified case cross-over approach is a popular alternative to conventional time series regression for analysing associations between time series of environmental exposures (air pollution, weather) and counts of health outcomes. These are almost always analyzed using conditional logistic regression on data expanded to case-control (case crossover) format, but this has some limitations. In particular adjusting for overdispersion and auto-correlation in the counts is not possible. It has been established that a Poisson model for counts with stratum indicators gives identical estimates to those from conditional logistic regression and does not have these limitations, but it is little used, probably because of the overheads in estimating many stratum parameters. Methods: The conditional Poisson model avoids estimating stratum parameters by conditioning on the total event count in each stratum, thus simplifying the computing and increasing the number of strata for which fitting is feasible compared with the standard unconditional Poisson model. Unlike the conditional logistic model, the conditional Poisson model does not require expanding the data, and can adjust for overdispersion and auto-correlation. It is available in Stata, R, and other packages. Results: By applying to some real data and using simulations, we demonstrate that conditional Poisson models were simpler to code and shorter to run than are conditional logistic analyses and can be fitted to larger data sets than possible with standard Poisson models. Allowing for overdispersion or autocorrelation was possible with the conditional Poisson model but when not required this model gave identical estimates to those from conditional logistic regression. Conclusions: Conditional Poisson regression models provide an alternative to case crossover analysis of stratified time series data with some advantages. The conditional Poisson model can also be used in other contexts in which primary control for confounding is by fine stratification.},

The absence of the body; binary diagnosis; the description of the surface of symptoms; the classification of diseases more similar to the botanical classification than to pathology; the process of cure directly linked to restitution of behaviors and moral values; as well as the over-power of the psychiatrist, seem to speak about the persistence of an old model of power, a pre-modern and pre-capitalist model, a residue of the old sovereign power.},

   abstract = {1. Executive Summary The Deepwater Horizon spill released over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico raising concerns for human health as well as ecological damage. As oil entered the Gulf of Mexico and inland waters, officials closed fishing areas to protect public health. Health assessment methodology provides a framework for the systematic analysis of the routes by which populations may be exposed to contaminants and the characterization of public health implications. This assessment provides a basis for decision making to protect public health and inform the public of the risks associated with the event. The two major pathways for exposure are the inhalation of volatile compounds and the consumption of oil-contaminated seafood. From a human health perspective, seafood is a possible route of human exposure if the fish or shellfish take up and accumulates contaminants in oil. Crude oil is composed of thousands of hydrocarbons and the composition begins to change, or " weather " , as soon as it enters the environment. Contaminants of concern in crude oil are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially the aromatic hydrocarbons, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene). Inhalation is the primary route of exposure for the VOCs. The other major compounds of concern are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have the potential to be taken up by seafood that is consumed by people. PAHs are widespread in the environment and do not accumulate to any extent. Finfish and crustaceans metabolize PAHs and will breakdown and excrete any that are taken up; mollusks breakdown PAHs more slowly and can accumulate these compounds when the amount in the environment is high. Extensive testing must be conducted to reopen closed fishing areas. Federal and state agencies developed a seafood monitoring protocol for reopening of waters closed to fishing. The overall plan utilizes a three tiered screening approach: 1) No visible oil observed in the designated areas; 2) Organoleptic testing of the seafood; and 3) Chemical testing of the seafood. Sampling for organoleptic or chemical analysis occurs only in areas with no visible oil and under consideration for reopening. The seafood monitoring program is designed to test areas free of oil and under consideration for reopening. The tiered approach to sampling screens out areas with observable oil and uses the chemical analysis to confirm the seafood is free of contamination.},

Some of the effects of climate change are likely to include more variable weather, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, flooding, droughts, more intense storms such as hurricanes, sea level rise, and air pollution. Each of these changes has the potential to negatively affect health. While climate change is recognized as a global issue, the effects of climate change will vary across geographic regions and populations. • Although scientific understanding of the effects of climate change is still emerging, there is a pressing need to prepare for potential health risks. This public health preparedness approach is applied to other threats in the absence of complete data, such as terrorism and pandemic influenza. A wide variety of organizations (federal, state, local, multilateral, private and nongovernmental) is working to address the implications of global climate change. Despite this breadth of activity, the public health effects of climate change remain largely unaddressed. • Climate change has the potential to impact health in many ways. While some of these are unpredictable, others (shown in the table) are supported by considerable evidence.},

Qualitative geography, by contrast is represented as nonempiricist or postempiricist, sensitive to complexity, contextual, and capable of empowering nonmainstream academic approaches and social groups. Attempts to engage in debate between these positions rarely challenge this dualism, reproducing the representation of quantitative geography as logical positivism, and a dualism separating quantitative and qualitative geography. I argue that this dualism can be broken down, by deconstructing the underlying representation. I discuss why this representation came into existence and how it was stabilized; how close attention to the practices of quantitative geographers, and particularly to the evolution of these practices, reveals its inadequacies; and what new possibilities for quantitative practices emerge from this deconstruction. GIS, one of the recent manifestations around which representations of quantitative geography polarize, is used as a case study to illustrate these arguments.

Rather than being a brand new approach, big data brings a series of problematic assumptions and practices first criticised 40 years ago by opponents of geography's quantitative revolution. Those assumptions, practices and criticisms are reviewed in the paper. © The Author(s) 2013.},

   abstract = {The rise of " Big Data " analytics in the private sector poses new challenges for privacy advocates. Through its reliance on existing data and predictive analysis to create detailed individual profiles, Big Data has explod-ed the scope of personally identifiable information (" PII "). It has also effec-tively marginalized regulatory schema by evading current privacy protections with its novel methodology. Furthermore, poor execution of Big Data meth-odology may create additional harms by rendering inaccurate profiles that nonetheless impact an individual's life and livelihood. To respond to Big Da-ta's evolving practices, this Article examines several existing privacy regimes and explains why these approaches inadequately address current Big Data challenges. This Article then proposes a new approach to mitigating predictive privacy harms—that of a right to procedural data due process. Although cur-rent privacy regimes offer limited nominal due process-like mechanisms, a more rigorous framework is needed to address their shortcomings. By examin-ing due process's role in the Anglo-American legal system and building on previous scholarship about due process for public administrative computer systems, this Article argues that individuals affected by Big Data should have similar rights to those in the legal system with respect to how their personal data is used in such adjudications. Using these principles, this Article analo-gizes a system of regulation that would provide such rights against private Big Data actors.},

   abstract = {This article examines whether some response strategies to climate variability and change have the potential to undermine long-term resilience of social-ecological systems. We define the parameters of a resilience approach, suggesting that resilience is characterized by the ability to absorb perturbations without changing overall system function, the ability to adapt within the resources of the system itself, and the ability to learn, innovate, and change. We evaluate nine current regional climate change policy responses and examine governance, sensitivity to feedbacks, and problem framing to evaluate impacts on characteristics of a resilient system. We find that some responses, such as the increase in harvest rates to deal with pine beetle infestations in Canada and expansion of biofuels globally, have the potential to undermine long-term resilience of resource systems. Other responses, such as decentralized water planning in Brazil and tropical storm disaster management in Caribbean islands, have the potential to increase long-term resilience. We argue that there are multiple sources of resilience in most systems and hence policy should identify such sources and strengthen capacities to adapt and learn. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The dominant research tradition on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actorcentered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning.

Objective: To examine how research on heatwaves and their health-related impact is distributed globally. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken. Four online databases were searched for articles examining links between specific historical heatwave events and their impact on mortality or morbidity. The locations of these events were mapped at a global scale, and compared to other known characteristics that influence heat-related illness and death. Results: When examining the location of heatwave and health impact research worldwide, studies were concentrated on mid-latitude, high-income countries of low- to medium-population density. Regions projected to experience the most extreme heatwaves in the future were not represented. Furthermore, the majority of studies examined mortality as a key indicator of population-wide impact, rather than the more sensitive indicator of morbidity. Conclusion: While global heatwave and health impact research is prolific in some regions, the global population most at risk of death and illness from extreme heat is under-represented. Heatwave and health impact research is needed in regions where this impact is expected to be most severe.},

   abstract = {Fostering resilience in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political uncertainty and risk has captured the attention of academics and decision makers across disciplines, sectors, and scales. Resilience has become an important goal for cities, particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the majority of the world's population, and, in addition to functioning as nodes of resource consumption and as sites for innovation, have become laboratories for resilience, both in theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly literature on urban resilience and concludes that the term has not been well defined. Existing definitions are inconsistent and underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper identifies six conceptual tensions fundamental to urban resilience: (1) definition of 'urban'; (2) understanding of system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative) conceptualizations of resilience; (4) mechanisms for system change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability; and (6) timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more conceptual clarity is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a new definition of urban resilience. This definition takes explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive and flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among, varying disciplines. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the definition might serve as a boundary object, with the acknowledgement that applying resilience in different contexts requires answering: Resilience for whom and to what? When? Where? And why?.},

Though these debates have focused largely on the biophysical dimensions of climate change, human dimensions research is equally in need of improved methodological approaches for research synthesis. Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applicability in an adaptation context. Customized review frameworks informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of systematic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice. We present guidelines, key considerations, and recommendations for systematic review in the social sciences in general and adaptation research in particular. We conclude by calling for increased conceptual and methodological development of systematic review approaches to address the methodological challenges of synthesizing and tracking adaptation to climate change.},

Geographers have played active roles in many interdisciplinary projects, because geography itself is inherently interdisciplinary. Geography builds on major emphases in spatial analysis, human-environment interaction, and place-based and regional analyses to encourage communication and interaction with myriad other disciplines. The active pursuit of inquiries related to space, place, and interactions, especially dynamics within and across spaces and places, leads many geographers to range far from the field's core and explore the peripheral realms where geographic perspectives and insights intersect with those from other fields. Scholars who have engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations cite many positive aspects in working with colleagues from other fields, and they affirm their desire to conduct interdisciplinary work in the future despite the challenges they face when moving beyond comfortable disciplinary cores. Patience and open-mindedness are among the critical factors that foster success of interdisciplinary collaboration. Geographers should continue to show interdisciplinary leadership by embracing different perspectives, by supporting institutional arrangements that foster interdisciplinary activity, and by seeking the knowledge and techniques other fields can share at the same time they contribute geographic perspectives, approaches, and insights to the collective effort.},

@article{Ebi2018,
   abstract = {As scientists and public health professionals, we welcome this synthesis of the health content of the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5C. Climate change affects health through a range of different pathways: from extreme weather events, to infectious disease, to water and food security. The actions that would be necessary to keep global warming below 1.5C, would themselves have effects on health, for example in reducing the intolerable death rate from air pollution. These diverse connections mean that information on the health implications of restricting global warming are scattered throughout the IPCC report. This synthesis does the valuable service of bringing them together in one place. The synthesis underlines three important messages. The first is that the greater the warming, the greater the risks to health overall. The IPCC special report makes clear that there are local variations and is frank about the uncertainties in attempting to give precise estimates of the health impacts under each scenario, particularly in specific locations. However, that is not an excuse for inaction. The report is clear that some of the consequences of global warming, such as the sea level rise that threatens population health, and eventually the existence of small island states and low-lying communities, increase inexorably with temperature. Higher air temperatures eventually pass the thresholds above which it is safe to work or play outside. Increasing energy in the atmosphere, leading to elevated air and water temperatures, increase the potential for extreme weather events and the transmission of certain infectious disease. Uncertainty about the precise magnitude and pattern of these changes should be an argument for caution, not complacency. There is a strong public health case for limiting warming to the greatest extent possible. The second message is that there can be important health gains from the actions that will be necessary to limit warming. Several important climate pollutants, including black carbon and methane, contribute directly or indirectly to the indoor and outdoor air pollution that causes approximately 7 million deaths a year around the world. Actions that target these pollutants can bring significant near-term health and climate benefits. Policies that address the upstream drivers of climate pollution, such as cleaner and more sustainable electricity generation systems, and urban design and transport policies that facilitate walking and cycling, promote health in diverse ways while also cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, which is the greatest overall contributor to long-term warming. The final message is that the speed of reducing emissions will affect the level of adaptation ambition required. The longer it takes to reduce emissions, the greater the adaptation needed to protect population health. No matter the extent of mitigation, there will be residual risks for health that health systems will need to manage.},

   abstract = {Adaptive capacity is an important element of long-term adaptation to climate change and is the focus of a rapidly growing body of research. Interdisciplinary growth has the potential to introduce new methods and insights, but it could also cause fragmentation and hamper methodological development or limit transfer of academic insights to climate change adaptation practice. This article uses qualitative content, bibliometric, and citation network analyses to systematically review the scope, methods, and findings of 276 studies on adaptive capacity of social and social-ecological systems. The review demonstrates that adaptive capacity research is highly interdisciplinary; covers a wide range of sectors, geographic locations, and scales of analysis; and is highly fragmented. The majority of empirical studies are isolated by lack of comparative work and cross-field citation. Forty-six percent of studies reviewed do not cite prior works on adaptive capacity: even those on similar topics in the same geographic location. Methods to assess adaptive capacity have proliferated to include more than 64 indicator-based indices or frameworks and 37 proxy outcome measures. The article argues that lack of either consensus or debate across the literature raises concerns that scientific progress in the field may be constrained and the ability of adaptive capacity research to inform adaptation practice may be limited. To promote consistency and transparency in future work, 158 determinants of adaptive capacity are defined and illustrated with common assessment indicators and examples. Additional opportunities for progress are noted with suggestions for future research.

Recently, case-crossover analysis has been proposed as an alternative analytical approach. While each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages, there remains considerable uncertainty as to which statistical methodology is preferable for evaluating data of this type. Methods. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of different variations of these two procedures using computer simulation. Hospital admission data were generated under realistic models with known parameters permitting estimates based on time series and case-crossover analyses to be compared with these known values. Results. While accurate estimates can be achieved with both methods, both methods require some decisions to be made by the researcher during the course of the analysis. With time series analysis, it is necessary to choose the time span in the LOESS smoothing process, or degrees of freedom when using natural cubic splines. For case-crossover studies using either uni- or bi-directional control selection strategies, the choice of time intervals needs to be made. Conclusions. We prefer the times series approach because the best estimates of risk that can be obtained with time series analysis are more precise than the best estimates based on case-crossover analysis.},

   abstract = {Background: The case-crossover design is an attractive alternative to the classical case-control design which can be used to study the onset of acute events if the risk factors of interest vary in time. By comparing exposures within cases at different time periods, the case-crossover design does not rely on control subjects which can be difficult to acquire. However, using the standard method of maximum likelihood, resulting risk estimates can be heavily biased when the prevalence to risk factors is very low (or very high). Methods: To overcome the problem of low risk factor prevalences, penalized conditional logistic regression via the lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) has been proposed in the literature as well as related methods such as the Firth correction. We apply and compare several penalized regression approaches in the context of a case-crossover analysis of the European Study of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (EuroSCAR; 1997-2001). Results: Out of 30 drugs, standard methods only correctly classified 17 drugs (including some highly implausible risk estimates), while penalized methods correctly classified 22 drugs. Conclusion: Penalized methods generally yield better risk classifications and much more plausible risk estimates for the EuroSCAR study than standard methods. As these novel techniques can be easily implemented using available R packages, we encourage routine use of penalized conditional logistic regression for case-crossover data.},

Recent models incorporating satellite remote sensing data have mitigated several limitations of previous studies, improving exposure assessment. This review focuses on these new temperature exposure models and their application in epidemiological studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Satellite observations of land surface temperature have been used to model air temperature across large spatial areas at high spatiotemporal resolutions. These models enable exposure assessment of entire populations and have been shown to reduce error in exposure estimates, thus mitigating downward bias in health effect estimates. SUMMARY: Satellite-based models improve our understanding of spatiotemporal variation in temperature and the associated health effects. Further research should focus on improving the resolution of these models, especially in urban areas, and increasing their use in epidemiological studies of direct temperature exposure and vector-borne diseases.},

   abstract = {This study examines effects of weather, temporal factors, and gasoline price on outdoor recreation participation by using a time series model. We obtained more than 5 years of daily outdoor recreation visitation data by using infrared mechanical counters on a section of the Florida National Scenic Trail (FNST). Results showed that days with daily maximum temperatures of 16–22 °C brought the largest number of visitors, which suggests this is the most comfortable range of daily maximum temperatures to recreate on the FNST. Daily maximum temperatures below 6 °C and above 31 °C and heat index values above 38 °C brought significantly lower visitor numbers, suggesting these values are temperature thresholds for this region in a recreation context. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model showed significant negative effects of temperature, relative humidity, cold snaps, and gasoline price and a positive effect of weekends and public holidays on recreational visitations to this trail. Days with heavy rainfall (> 2.54 cm) or a high heat index (≥ 35 °C) were likely to negatively affect recreation participation not only on the same day, but also on the next normal weather day. These findings imply that managers of facilities that need staffing and other resources should expect to receive fewer visitors on days following adverse weather conditions, even if that day has normal weather conditions.},

   abstract = {This research explores, by means of a questionnaire-based survey, public knowledge and perception as well as the behaviour of young Spanish tourists before, during and after the summer holiday period affected by an episode of extreme heat in 2003. The survey was administered between November and December 2004. The extraordinary heat wave of the summer of 2003 can be seen as an example of a normal episode in terms of the predicted intensity and duration of European summers towards the end of the twenty-first century. It can therefore be used as the laboratory setting for this study. In this context, the use of the climate analogue approach allows us to obtain novel perspectives regarding the future impact that this type of event could have on tourist demand, based on a real experience. Likewise, such an approach allows the strategies of adaptation implemented by the different elements in the tourist system in order to cope with the atmospheric episode to be evaluated. Such strategies could prove useful in reducing vulnerability when faced with similar episodes in the future. The main results indicate that Spanish tourists (young segment market) are flexible in adapting to episodes of extremely high temperatures. Their personal perception of the phenomenon, their behaviour and the adaptation measures implemented to a greater or lesser extent before that time, reduce the vulnerability of the sector when faced with this type of event, at least from the point of view of this young segment of the internal national market. In Spain, the episode of extreme heat of 2003 has led to the implementation or improvement of some adaptive measures after the event, especially in the fields of management, policy and education. © 2013 ISB.},

Cities will be exposed to climate change from greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, and localised effects from urbanisation such as the urban heat island. An urban landsurface model has been included in the HadAM3 Global Climate Model. It shows that regions of high population growth coincide with regions of high urban heat island potential, most notably in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and East Africa. Climate change has the capacity to modify the climatic potential for urban heat islands, with increases of 30% in some locations, but a global average reduction of 6%. Warming and extreme heat events due to urbanisation and increased energy consumption are simulated to be as large as the impact of doubled CO2 in some regions, and climate change increases the disparity in extreme hot nights between rural and urban areas.

   abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of food environments, characterized as food swamps, on adult obesity rates. Food swamps have been described as areas with a high-density of establishments selling high-calorie fast food and junk food, relative to healthier food options. This study examines multiple ways of categorizing food environments as food swamps and food deserts, including alternate versions of the Retail Food Environment Index. We merged food outlet, sociodemographic and obesity data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Environment Atlas, the American Community Survey, and a commercial street reference dataset. We employed an instrumental variables (IV) strategy to correct for the endogeneity of food environments (i.e., that individuals self-select into neighborhoods and may consider food availability in their decision). Our results suggest that the presence of a food swamp is a stronger predictor of obesity rates than the absence of full-service grocery stores. We found, even after controlling for food desert effects, food swamps have a positive, statistically significant effect on adult obesity rates. All three food swamp measures indicated the same positive association, but reflected different magnitudes of the food swamp effect on rates of adult obesity (p values ranged from 0.00 to 0.16). Our adjustment for reverse causality, using an IV approach, revealed a stronger effect of food swamps than would have been obtained by naïve ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. The food swamp effect was stronger in counties with greater income inequality (p < 0.05) and where residents are less mobile (p < 0.01). Based on these findings, local government policies such as zoning laws simultaneously restricting access to unhealthy food outlets and incentivizing healthy food retailers to locate in underserved neighborhoods warrant consideration as strategies to increase health equity.},

   abstract = {More than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The consistency of observed and modeled changes across the climate system, including warming of the atmosphere and ocean, sea level rise, ocean acidification and changes in the water cycle, the cryosphere and climate extremes points to a large-scale warming resulting primarily from anthropogenic increases in GHG concentrations. Solar forcing is the only known natural forcing acting to warm the climate over this period but it has increased much less than GHG forcing, and the observed pattern of long-term tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is not consistent with the expected response to solar irradiance variations. The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) could be a confounding influence but studies that find a significant role for the AMO show that this does not project strongly onto 1951-2010 temperature trends. (10.3.1, Table 10.1\} It is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010. This assessment is supported by robust evidence from multiple studies using different methods. Observational uncertainty has been explored much more thoroughly than previously and the assessment now considers observations from the first decade of the 21st century and simulations from a new generation of climate models whose ability to simulate historical climate has improved in many respects relative to the previous generation of models considered in AR4.},

   abstract = {Heat waves represent a threat to human health and excess mortality is one of the associated negative effects. A health-based definition for heat waves is therefore relevant, especially for early warning purposes, and it is here investigated via the universal thermal climate index (UTCI). The UTCI is a bioclimate index elaborated via an advanced model of human thermoregulation that estimates the thermal stress induced by air temperature, wind speed, moisture, and radiation on the human physiology. Using France as a test bed, the UTCI was computed from meteorological reanalysis data to assess the thermal stress conditions associated with heat-attributable excess mortality in five cities. UTCI values at different climatological percentiles were defined and evaluated in their ability to identify periods of excess mortality (PEMs) over 24 years. Using verification metrics such as the probability of detection (POD), the false alarm ratio (FAR), and the frequency bias (FB), daily minimum and maximum heat stress levels equal to or above corresponding UTCI 95th percentiles (158 © 28C and 34.58 © 1.58C, respectively) for 3 consecutive days are demonstrated to correlate to PEMs with the highest sensitivity and specificity (0.69 ≤ POD ≤ 1, 0.19 ≤ FAR ≤ 0.46, 1 ≤ FB ≤ 1.48) than minimum, maximum, and mean heat stress level singularly and other bioclimatological percentiles. This finding confirms the detrimental effect of prolonged, unusually high heat stress at day-and nighttime and suggests the UTCI 95th percentile as a health-meaningful threshold for a potential heat-health watch warning system.},

Heat waves have been described by several attributes and combinations which constitute various event typologies. Attributes of heat waves from 10 cities are analyzed over the period 1950–2016 to understand how these attributes determine variability in local heat waves and how climate change affects heat waves across the United States. This study uses eight definitions to differentiate heat waves and tests for temporal trends in key properties of heat waves over the period 1950–2016. At least five harmful attributes of heat waves have increased simultaneously for Dallas, Miami, New York, Phoenix, and Portland.Miami showed the greatest change in heat wave season length, frequency, and timing over the study period. Surprisingly, the greatest mean heat wave intensities above daily thresholds were for Bismarck, ND (+8.2 °C) and Syracuse, NY (+6.5 °C). Similar results across Baltimore, MD, Colorado Springs, CO, Dallas, TX, Des Moines, IA, Miami, FL, New York, NY, Phoenix, AZ, and Portland, OR, are presented to clarify the many quantitative differences in heat wave attributes and variance in quantification approaches across climates. This work explores the nexus of quantitative description and social construction of heat waves through the lens of the various regional metrics to describe heat waves. Ultimately, this assessment will guide the development of various strategies to help communities understand and prepare for heat resilience based on local heat wave components.},

   abstract = {Unusually hot weather is a major concern to public health as well as other systems (e.g., ecological, economical, energy). This study utilized spatially continuous and homogenized observational surface climate data to examine changes in the regularity of heat waves in the continental United States. This included the examination of heat waves according only to daytime temperatures, nighttime temperatures, and both daytime and nighttime temperatures. Results confirmed a strong increase in the prevalence of heat waves between the mid-1970s and the dataset end (2015), and that increase was preceded by a mild decrease since the dataset beginning (1948). Results were unclear whether the prevalence of nighttime or simultaneous daytime-nighttime heat waves increased the most, but it was clear that increases were largest in the summer. The largest gains occurred in the West and Southwest, and a ''warming hole'' was most conspicuous in the northern Great plains. The changes in heat wave prevalence were similar to changes in the mean temperatures, and more so in the daytime heat waves. Daytime and nighttime heat waves coincided with one another more frequently in recent years than they did in the 1970s. Some parts of the United States (West Coast) were more likely than other parts to experience daytime and nighttime heat waves simultaneously. While linear trends were not sensitive to the climate dataset, trend estimation method, or heat wave definition, they were mildly sensitive to the start and end dates and extremely sensitive to the climate base period method (fixed in time or directly preceding any given heat wave).},

No uniform definition of a heat wave exists. Most past research on heat waves has focused on evaluating the aftermath of known heat waves, with minimal consideration of missing exposure information. Objectives: To identify and discuss methods of handling and imputing missing weather data and how those methods can affect identified periods of extreme heat in Florida. Methods: In addition to ignoring missing data, temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal models are described and utilized to impute missing historical weather data from 1973 to 2012 from 43 Florida weather monitors. Calculated thresholds are used to define periods of extreme heat across Florida. Results: Modeling of missing data and imputing missing values can affect the identified periods of extreme heat, through the missing data itself or through the computed thresholds. The differences observed are related to the amount of missingness during June, July, and August, the warmest months of the warm season (April through September). Conclusions: Missing data considerations are important when defining periods of extreme heat. Spatiotemporal methods are recommended for data imputation. A heat wave definition that incorporates information from all monitors is advised.},

The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations. 1995 The Ohio State University},

Using numerous meteorological observations, the spatial synoptic classification has been used to classify each summer day from 1989 to 1998 into one of eight air mass types for Shanghai. Through the comparative analysis of the daily air mass type and the corresponding Shanghai mortality rate, "moist tropical plus" (MT+), an extremely hot and humid air mass, was identified as an offensive air mass with the highest rates of mortality. Using stepwise regression, an algorithm was produced to help predict the number of excess deaths that will occur with each occurence of the MT+ airmass. The heat/health warning system was run experimentally in the summer of 2001 and illustrated that the use of a warning system can alert the city's residents of potentially offensive weather situations that can lead to a deterioration in human health.},

   abstract = {Despite recent advances in the classification of synoptic-scale events, there remains the need for development of a simple, automated, continental-scale air mass-based procedure. We present a new method of analysis to identify resident air masses at first-order weather stations to facilitate intersite comparison of daily air masses across a very large region. The 'spatial synoptic classification' (SSC) requires initial identification of the major air masses and their typical meteorological characteristics at each site. 'Seed days', which exhibit these typical characteristics for each air mass, are used as input for a linear discriminant function analysis, which produces a daily categorization of air masses with spatially continuous results. A second discriminant function analysis is used to determine whether a day is to be considered transitional between air masses. Using the SSC, air-mass frequencies were developed for winter across the USA east of the Rockies, and rates of modification were determined as each air mass traversed the region. The impact of snow cover on modification rates was determined by comparing two winter months with very different snow cover characteristics across the area. Keeping other factors constant, it appears that extended snow cover can reduce the temperature of a dry polar air mass by up to 11°C.},

   abstract = {Understanding how weather impacts health is critical, especially under a changing climate; however, relatively few studies have investigated subtropical regions. We examined how mortality in São Paulo, Brazil, is affected by cold, heat, and heat waves over 14.5 years (1996–2010). We used over-dispersed generalized linear modeling to estimate heat- and cold-related mortality, and Bayesian hierarchical modeling to estimate overall effects and modification by heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration, and timing in season). Stratified analyses were performed by cause of death and individual characteristics (sex, age, education, marital status, and place of death). Cold effects on mortality appeared higher than heat effects in this subtropical city with moderate climatic conditions. Heat was associated with respiratory mortality and cold with cardiovascular mortality. Risk of total mortality was 6.1 % (95 % confidence interval 4.7, 7.6 %) higher at the 99th percentile of temperature than the 90th percentile (heat effect) and 8.6 % (6.2, 11.1 %) higher at the 1st compared to the 10th percentile (cold effect). Risks were higher for females and those with no education for heat effect, and males for cold effect. Older persons, widows, and non-hospital deaths had higher mortality risks for heat and cold. Mortality during heat waves was higher than on non-heat wave days for total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Our findings indicate that mortality in São Paulo is associated with both cold and heat and that some subpopulations are more vulnerable.},

   abstract = {Extreme hot weather events are likely to increase under future climate change, and it is exacerbated in urban areas due to the complex urban settings. It causes excess mortality due to prolonged exposure to such extreme heat. However, there is lack of universal definition of prolonged heat or heat wave, which leads to inadequacies of associated risk preparedness. Previous studies focused on estimating temperature-mortality relationship based on temperature thresholds for assessing heat-related health risks but only several studies investigated the association between types of prolonged heat and excess mortality. However, most studies focused on one or a few isolated heat waves, which cannot demonstrate typical scenarios that population has experienced. In addition, there are limited studies on the difference between daytime and nighttime temperature, resulting in insufficiency to conclude the effect of prolonged heat. In sub-tropical high-density cities where prolonged heat is common in summer, it is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of prolonged heat for a complete assessment of heat-related health risks. In this study, six types of prolonged heat were examined by using a time-stratified analysis. We found that more consecutive hot nights contribute to higher mortality risk while the number of consecutive hot days does not have significant association with excess mortality. For a day after five consecutive hot nights, there were 7.99% [7.64%, 8.35%], 7.74% [6.93%, 8.55%], and 8.14% [7.38%, 8.88%] increases in all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, respectively. Non-consecutive hot days or nights are also found to contribute to short-term mortality risk. For a 7-day-period with at least five non-consecutive hot days and nights, there was 15.61% [14.52%, 16.70%] increase in all-cause mortality at lag 0–1, but only −2.00% [−2.83%, −1.17%] at lag 2–3. Differences in the temperature-mortality relationship caused by hot days and hot nights imply the need to categorize prolonged heat for public health surveillance. Findings also contribute to potential improvement to existing heat-health warning system.},

   abstract = {As climate change impacts are felt around the globe, people are increasingly exposed to changes in weather patterns, wildlife and vegetation, and water and food quality, access and availability in their local regions. These changes can impact human health and well-being in a variety of ways: increased risk of foodborne and waterborne diseases; increased frequency and distribution of vector-borne disease; increased mortality and injury due to extreme weather events and heat waves; increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease due to changes in air quality and increased allergens in the air; and increased susceptibility to mental and emotional health challenges. While climate change is a global phenomenon, the impacts are experienced most acutely in place; as such, a sense of place, place-attachment, and place-based identities are important indicators for climate-related health and adaptation. Representing one of the first qualitative case studies to examine the connections among climate change, a changing sense of place, and health in an Inuit context, this research draws data from a multi-year community-driven case study situated in the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Canada. Data informing this paper were drawn from the narrative analysis of 72 in-depth interviews conducted from November 2009 to October 2010, as well as from the descriptive analysis of 112 questionnaires from a survey in October 2010 (95% response rate). The findings illustrated that climate change is negatively affecting feelings of place attachment by disrupting hunting, fishing, foraging, trapping, and traveling, and changing local landscapes-changes which subsequently impact physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being. These results also highlight the need to develop context-specific climate-health planning and adaptation programs, and call for an understanding of place-attachment as a vital indicator of health and well-being and for climate change to be framed as an important determinant of health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A systematic search of social science databases revealed 31 works (1996–2016) directly addressing place attachment in relation to different types of natural hazard risks (e.g., seismic, volcanic, etc.). Across different contexts, the research shows: (a) positive and/or negative relationships between place attachment and natural environmental risk perception; (b) positive and/or negative relationships between place attachment and risk coping; and (c) mediating and moderating relationships. In particular, results show that: (a) highly attached individuals perceive natural environmental risks but underestimate their potential effects; (b) highly attached individuals are unwilling to relocate when facing natural environmental risks and more likely to return to risky areas after a natural environmental disaster; (c) place attachment acts both as a mediating and moderating variable between risk perception and coping.

Some end-of-century impacts were projected: Expected warming will decrease gas-fired generator efficiency. The maximum statewide coincident loss is projected at 10.3 gigawatts (with current power plant infrastructure and population), an increase of 6.2 percent over current temperature-induced losses. By the end of the century, electricity demand for almost all summer days is expected to exceed the current ninetieth percentile per-capita peak load. As much as 21 percent growth is expected in ninetieth percentile peak demand (per-capita, exclusive of population growth). When generator losses are included in the demand, the ninetieth percentile peaks may increase up to 25 percent. As the climate warms, California's peak supply capacity will need to grow faster than the population. Substation capacity is projected to decrease an average of 2.7 percent. A 5C (9F) air temperature increase (the average increase predicted for hot days in August) will diminish the capacity of a fully-loaded transmission line by an average of 7.5 percent. The potential exposure of transmission lines to wildfire is expected to increase with time. We have identified some lines whose probability of exposure to fire are expected to increase by as much as 40 percent. Up to 25 coastal power plants and 86 substations are at risk of flooding (or partial flooding) due to sea level rise.},

Yet there remains fairly limited knowledge of the penetration of private (home air conditioning) and distribution of public (cooling centers and commercial space) cooled space across cities. Furthermore, the deployment of government-sponsored cooling centers is likely to be inadequately informed with respect to the location of existing cooling resources (residential air conditioning and air conditioned public space), raising questions of the equitability of access to heat refuges. We explore the distribution of private and public cooling resources and access inequities at the household level in two major US urban areas: Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (whose county seat is Phoenix). We evaluate the presence of in-home air conditioning and develop a walking-based accessibility measure to air conditioned public space using a combined cumulative opportunities-gravity approach. We find significant variations in the distribution of residential air conditioning across both regions which are largely attributable to building age and inter/intra-regional climate differences. There are also regional disparities in walkable access to public cooled space. At average walking speeds, we find that official cooling centers are only accessible to a small fraction of households (3% in Los Angeles, 2% in Maricopa) while a significantly higher number of households (80% in Los Angeles, 39% in Maricopa) have access to at least one other type of public cooling resource such as a library or commercial establishment. Aggregated to a neighborhood level, we find that there are areas within each region where access to cooled space (either public or private) is limited which may increase heat-related health risks.},

This study examined heat-related health inequalities within one city in order to understand the relationships between the microclimates of urban neighborhoods, population characteristics, thermal environments that regulate microclimates, and the resources people possess to cope with climatic conditions. A simulation model was used to estimate an outdoor human thermal comfort index (HTCI) as a function of local climate variables collected in 8 diverse city neighborhoods during the summer of 2003 in Phoenix, USA. HTCI is an indicator of heat stress, a condition that can cause illness and death. There were statistically significant differences in temperatures and HTCI between the neighborhoods during the entire summer, which increased during a heat wave period. Lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups were more likely to live in warmer neighborhoods with greater exposure to heat stress. High settlement density, sparse vegetation, and having no open space in the neighborhood were significantly correlated with higher temperatures and HTCI. People in warmer neighborhoods were more vulnerable to heat exposure because they had fewer social and material resources to cope with extreme heat. Urban heat island reduction policies should specifically target vulnerable residential areas and take into account equitable distribution and preservation of environmental resources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

City-specific Poisson regression analyses of daily noninjury mortality were fit with predictors of mean daily apparent temperature (a construct reflecting physiologic effects of temperature and humidity), time, barometric pressure, day of the week, and particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter. Percentage change in mortality was calculated at 29°C apparent temperature (lag 0) and at -5°C (mean of lags 1, 2, and 3) relative to 15°C. Separate models were fit to death counts stratified by age, race, gender, education, and place of death. Effect estimates were combined across cities, treating city as a random effect. Deaths among Blacks compared with Whites, deaths among the less educated, and deaths outside a hospital were more strongly associated with hot and cold temperatures, but gender made no difference. Stronger cold associations were found for those less than age 65 years, but heat effects did not vary by age. The strongest effect modifier was place of death for heat, with out-of-hospital effects more than five times greater than in-hospital deaths, supporting the biologic plausibility of the associations. Place of death, race, and educational attainment indicate vulnerability to temperature-related mortality, reflecting inequities in health impacts related to climate change.},

In response to the devastating mortality and morbidity of recent heatwave events, many countries have introduced heatwave early warning systems (HEWS). HEWS are designed to reduce the avoidable human health consequences of heatwaves through timely notification of prevention measures to vulnerable populations. Objective: To identify the key characteristics of HEWS in European countries to help inform modification of current, and development of, new systems and plans. Methods: We searched the internet to identify HEWS policy or government documents for 33 European countries and requested information from relevant organizations. We translated the HEWS documents and extracted details on the trigger indicators, thresholds for action, notification strategies, message intermediaries, communication and dissemination strategies, prevention strategies recommended and specified target audiences. Findings and Conclusions: Twelve European countries have HEWS. Although there are many similarities among the HEWS, there also are differences in key characteristics that could inform improvements in heatwave early warning plans. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {Background: The impact of global warming on population health is a growing concern and has been widely discussed. The issue of heat stress disorders and consequent productivity reduction among workers has not yet been widely addressed. Taiwan is an island straddling the Tropic of Cancer in the West Pacific and has both subtropical and tropical climates. As of 2008, the economy of Taiwan accounts for 1.1% of the world gross domestic product at purchasing power parity and is listed as 19th in the world and eighth in Asia, according to International Monetary Fund data. Objective: The aim of this paper is to identify occupations at risk and the potential health impacts of heat on workers in Taiwan. Design: Historical data relating to meteorology, population, the labour force and economy were obtained from publicly available databases from the Taiwanese government. Results: Hot seasons with an average maximum temperature above 30°C and relative humidity above 74%, lasting for four to six months from May to October, pose health threats to construction, farming and fishery workers. In particular, populations of ageing farmers and physically overloaded construction workers are the two most vulnerable worker categories in which high temperature impacts on health and productivity. Conclusions: Currently, regulations and preventive actions for heat relief are difficult to enforce for several reasons, including lack of equipment for measuring environmental conditions, lack of awareness of potential hazards and strict time constraints imposed on workers. There is an urgent need to systematically and comprehensively assess the impact of a warming climate on workers' health and productivity to provide effective prevention strategies for a better working and living environment in Taiwan. © 2009 Ro-Ting Lin and Chang-Chuan Chan.},

   abstract = {This study aims to explore the travel behavior of bike-sharing users in Zhongshan, China. To this end, we use 5 months of trip data, which included origin and destination locations, and pickup and return time of each used bike in the system. To get a complete picture of the behavior, we distinguished between trips, trip chains, and transition activities. We categorized different trip chains and constructed transition matrices between activities. We found that almost all trips have different origin and destination stations. Two thirds of the trips are part of a trip chain consisting of multiple trips. Although users often use another station to start their next trip, a clear picture emerges in which public bikes are used as a single mode to hop from one destination to another, and at the end return more or less to the same location where the trip chain was started. Moreover, based on the trip chain matrices and transition matrices between activities, we conclude that users mainly used public bikes for commuting, and some of users went home during lunch break, while the system was also used or after-work shopping activities.},

   abstract = {The revolution in mobility-sharing services brings disruptive changes to the transportation landscape around the globe. The authorities often rush to regulate the services without a good knowledge of these new options. In Singapore and some other cities, dockless bike-sharing systems rose and fell in just one year and were followed by the booming of docking scooter-sharing systems. This study conducts a comparative analysis of bike-sharing and scooter-sharing activities in Singapore to help understand the phenomenon and inform policy-making. Based on the collected data (i.e., origin-destination pairs enriched with the departure and arrival time and the GPS locations) for one month, this study proposed methods to construct the paths and estimated repositioning trips and the fleet sizes. Hence, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the two systems in two discrete urban areas was investigated. It explored the impact of the fleet size, operational regulations (dockless versus docking), and weather conditions on the usages. We found that shared scooters have spatially compact and quantitatively denser distribution compared with shared bikes, and their high demands associate with places such as attractions, metros, and the dormitory. Results suggest that scooter sharing has a better performance than bike sharing in terms of the increased sharing frequency and decreased fleet size; however, the shareability still has potential to be improved. High repositioning rates of shared-scooters indicates high maintenance cost for rebalancing and charging. Rainfall and high temperatures at noon suppress the usages but not conclusively. The study also proposes several initiatives to promote the sustainable development of scooter-sharing services.},

   abstract = {Heat-related illness, also called hyperthermia, is a condition resulting from exposure to extreme heat where the body becomes unable to properly cool, resulting in a rapid rise in body temperature. The evaporation of sweat is the normal way to remove body heat, but, when the humidity is high, sweat does not evaporate as quickly. 3 This, in turn, prevents the body from releasing heat quickly. Prompt treatment of heat-related illnesses with aggressive fluid replacement and cooling of core body temperature is critical to reducing illness and preventing death. 4 HEAT EXHAUSTION Exposure to excessive heat can directly or indirectly cause some illnesses and can exacerbate many preexisting conditions, such as heart and respiratory disease. Of the heat-related illnesses, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are the most serious. The symptoms of heat exhaustion include 5 • Muscle cramping • Fatigue • Headache • Nausea or vomiting • Dizziness or fainting HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS QUICK FACTS Despite the fact that all heat-related deaths and illnesses are preventable, each year an average of about 658 people succumb to extreme heat 1. Estimating the public health impact of extreme heat is difficult because heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion, do not require reporting to public health agencies. Aspects of the man-made environment-access to transportation, medical care, and cooling centers and prevalence of crime in a neighborhood-can accentuate the health risks of heat waves. 2},

However, there are older people living within the community who have developed adaptive and resilient environments around their home that provide some protection during periods of extreme heat. This study investigated the housing stock and self-reported thermal comfort of a group of older people living in a regional town in Australia during the summer of 2012. The results indicated that daily maximum living room temperature was not significantly correlated with outdoor temperature, and daily minimum living room temperature was very weakly correlated with outdoor temperature. Residents reported feeling comfortable when indoor temperature approximated 26 °C. As living room temperature increased, indoor thermal comfort decreased. Significant differences between indoor temperatures were noted for homes that were related to house characteristics such as the age of the house, the number of airconditioning units, the pitch of the roof, home insulation and the number of heat-mitigation modifications made to the home. Brick veneer homes showed smaller diurnal changes in temperature than other building materials. With population ageing and the increasing focus on older people living in the community, the quality of the housing stock available to them will influence their risk of heat exposure during extreme weather.},

From 2016 to 2017, 101 Detroit residents were surveyed once regarding extreme heat, housing and neighborhood features, and heat-related illness in the prior 5 years. Academic partners selected initial confounders and, after instruction on directed acyclic graphs, community partners proposed alternate directed acyclic graphs with additional confounders. Heat-related illness was regressed on AC type or health and co-selected confounders. The study found that heat-related illness was associated with no-AC (n = 96, odds ratio (OR) = 4.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22, 17.72); living ≤5 years in present home (n = 57, OR = 10.39, 95% CI = 1.13, 95.88); and fair/poor vs. good/excellent health (n = 97, OR = 3.15, 95% CI = 1.33, 7.48). Co-analysis suggested multiple built-environment confounders. We conclude that Detroit residents with poorer health and no AC are at greater risk during extreme heat.

Notably, indoor exposure is implicated in nearly half of such cases, and lack of functioning air conditioning (AC) is the predominant cause of overheating. For residents with limited capacity to purchase, maintain, and operate an AC system, or during summertime power outages, the ability of buildings to maintain safe thermal conditions without mechanical cooling is the primary protective factor against heat. In this paper, we use whole-building energy simulations to compare indoor air temperature inside archetypical single-family residential buildings without AC at the start and middle of the century in eight US cities. We ran the models using hourly output from 10 year regional climate simulations that explicitly include heating from mid-century projections of urban development and climate change under a 'business-as-usual' emissions scenario. Moreover, to identify the impacts from evolving construction practices, we compare different versions of building energy standards. Our analysis shows that summertime overheat time may increase by up to 25% by the middle of century. Moreover, we find that, while newer building energy codes reduce thermal comfort under moderate outdoor weather, they perform better under extreme heat.},

We create a tract-level data set combining housing characteristics, downscaled climate projections, and an index of adaptive capacity and sensitivity to heat. We analyze exposure and vulnerability to heat by housing type and location. We find that subsidized housing is disproportionately located in the hottest tracts that simultaneously also have the most sensitive populations and barriers to adaptation (high-high tracts).

A great deal of the research about the health impacts from extreme heat has used ambient meteorological measurements, which can result in exposure misclassification because buildings alter indoor temperatures and ambient temperatures are not uniform across cities. To characterize indoor temperature exposures during an extreme heat event in buildings with and without central air conditioning (AC), personal monitoring was conducted with 51 (central AC, n = 24; non-central AC, n = 27) low-income senior residents of public housing in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2015, to comprehensively assess indoor temperatures, sleep, and physiological outcomes of galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR), along with daily surveys of adaptive behaviors and health symptoms. As expected, non-central AC units (Tmean = 25.6° C) were significantly warmer than those with central AC (Tmean = 23.2° C, p < 0.001). With higher indoor temperatures, sleep was more disrupted and GSR and HR both increased (p < 0.001). However, there were no changes in hydration behaviors between residents of different buildings over time and few moderate/several health symptoms were reported. This suggests both a lack of behavioral adaptation and thermal decompensation beginning, highlighting the need to improve building cooling strategies and heat education to low-income senior residents, especially in historically cooler climates.},

Central and ductless AC types were associated with the coolest indoor conditions; homes with window and portable AC were significantly warmer. Apartments on the top floor of a building were significantly hotter during heat advisory periods than other apartments regardless of the presence of AC. High indoor HI levels persisted in some homes for approximately 1 day following the end of the two heat advisory periods.

Adverse health impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic studies have identified specific population and community characteristics that mark vulnerability to heat waves. OBJECTIVES: We situated vulnerability to heat in geographic space and identified potential areas for intervention and further research. METHODS: We mapped and analyzed 10 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality in the United States: six demographic characteristics and two household air conditioning variables from the U.S. Census Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and diabetes prevalence from a national survey. We performed a factor analysis of these 10 variables and assigned values of increasing vulnerability for the four resulting factors to each of 39,794 census tracts. We added the four factor scores to obtain a cumulative heat vulnerability index value. RESULTS: Four factors explained > 75% of the total variance in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a) social/environmental vulnerability (combined education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation, c) air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion elderly/diabetes. We found substantial spatial variability of heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher vulnerability in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the lowest in the Southeast. In urban areas, inner cities showed the highest vulnerability to heat. CONCLUSIONS: These methods provide a template for making local and regional heat vulnerability maps. After validation using health outcome data, interventions can be targeted at the most vulnerable populations.},

In total, 908 respondents participated in the telephone survey. Some of the key results indicate that knowledge of the heat warning was nearly universal (90%), and likely due to pervasive media coverage more than any other means. Though knowledge of the event was widespread, knowledge of what to do was less common. Only around half of all respondents mentioned that they changed their behavior, and despite the diversity of information available on mitigating heat vulnerability, most respondents stated that they merely "avoided the outdoors" at all costs. Though air conditioning was nearly ubiquitous among respondents, over a third mentioned that economic factors of energy costs were considered in terms of how long or whether the air conditioner was turned on. © 2006 ISB.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are increasing in New York State (NYS) and have been linked with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality. But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS. Study design: Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas. Methods: Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories. Results: Thirteen variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability; and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability. Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI. Conclusions: The NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects of heat in vulnerable areas.},

   abstract = {In an extreme heat event, people can go to air-conditioned public facilities if residential air-conditioning is not available. Residences that heat slowly may also mitigate health effects, particularly in neighborhoods with social vulnerability. We explored the contributions of social vulnerability and these infrastructures to heat mortality in Maricopa County and whether these relationships are sensitive to temperature. Using Poisson regression modeling with heat-related mortality as the outcome, we assessed the interaction of increasing temperature with social vulnerability, access to publicly available air conditioned space, home air conditioning and the thermal properties of residences. As temperatures increase, mortality from heat-related illness increases less in census tracts with more publicly accessible cooled spaces. Mortality from all internal causes of death did not have this association. Building thermal protection was not associated with mortality. Social vulnerability was still associated with mortality after adjusting for the infrastructure variables. To reduce heat-related mortality, the use of public cooled spaces might be expanded to target the most vulnerable.},

   abstract = {Household-level information on central (cenAC) and room (rmAC) air conditioning and cold- weather thermal comfort are often missing from publicly available housing databases hindering research and action on climate adaptation and air pollution exposure reduction. We modeled these using information from the American Housing Survey for 2003–2013 and 140 U.S. core-based statistical areas employing variables that would be present in publicly available parcel records. We present random-intercept logistic regression models with either cenAC, rmAC or “home was uncomfortably cold for 24 hours or more” (tooCold) as outcome variables and housing value, rented vs. owned, age, and multi- vs. single-family, each interacted with cooling- or heating-degree days as predictors. The out-of-sample predicted probabilities for years 2015–2017 were compared to corresponding American Housing Survey values (0 or 1). Using a 0.5 probability threshold, the model had 63% specificity (true negative rate), and 91% sensitivity (true positive rate) for cenAC, while specificity and sensitivity for rmAC were 94% and 34%, respectively. Area-specific sensitivities and specificities varied widely. For tooCold, the overall sensitivity was effectively 0%. Future epidemiologic studies, heat vulnerability maps, and intervention screenings may reliably use these or similar AC models with parcel-level data to improve understanding of health risk and the spatial patterning of homes without AC.},

Research on health impacts of climate change (including increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of hot weather) is sometimes designed and implemented without the involvement of the communities being studied, i.e., “community-placed” not “community-based.” We describe how the Heatwaves, Housing, and Health: Increasing Climate Resiliency in Detroit (HHH) partnership engaged relevant communities by integrating a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach into an existing, academic-designed research project through a steering committee of community and academic partners. Using a case study approach, we analyze program documentation, partnership evaluation questionnaires, and HHH steering committee meeting notes. We describe the CBPR process by which we successfully collected research data in Detroit during summer 2016, engaged in collaborative analysis of data, and shared results with Detroit residents. Evaluations of the partnership over 2 years show community involvement in research; enhanced capacities; success in securing new grant funding; and ways that CBPR strengthened the validity, relevance, and translation of research. Engaging communities as equal partners using CBPR, even after a study is underway, can strengthen research to understand and address the impacts of extreme heat on health and equity in urban communities.},

Confidence intervals for such components exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate result, where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest and V f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f=0 is proposed. It is shown that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given by the null space of the component's smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model fits or null distribution simulation. © 2012 Biometrika Trust.},

   abstract = {Purpose: The quality and economy of inferential research rely heavily on the sampling method. This paper addresses a methodological challenge in environment-behavior research: sampling respondents in relation to their built environmental characteristics. Methods: A discussion of issues related to traditional neighborhood-based sampling serves to introduce a new spatial sampling strategy. Spatial sampling consists of defining conceptual population of interest, constructing spatial sample frame using parcel-level environmental data in GIS, examining the sample frame, determining the sampling design and size, and drawing the samples. An application of this method is illustrated using a recent study examining environmental correlates of walking and biking. Results: Spatial sampling with parcel-level data ensures sufficient variations in and proper distributions of the environmental variables of interest, while controlling for the conditions of no interest. The use of the individual as unit of analysis offers an economic, generalizable, and easily interpretable approach to environment-behavior research, and discourages the potentially erroneous a priori definition of neighborhoods and aggregation problems. Conclusions: With its capacity to consider a broad range of detailed environmental variables, spatial sampling contributes to finding new or stronger environment-behavior associations and to the growing number of studies using the social ecologic model. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

For each interviewee, a value of the Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was calculated based on the values of operational variables obtained from the questionnaires and the environmental variables measured during the survey. This allowed to calculate the seasonal preferred and neutral PETs and the annual PET comfort range. Also, the scale of the PET thermal perception was determined for the Konya population and, more generally, for the inhabitants of the BSk Köppen-Geiger climate zone. Statistical analyzes carried out in terms of Variance Inflationary Factor, multicollinearity assessment and Best Subsets Analysis led to the identification of the Turkish Outdoor Comfort Index, an empirical index able to predict the average value of the thermal perception of a large group of individuals living in the aforementioned climate zone.

   abstract = {Protecting health from rising temperatures and extreme heat Key facts  Population exposure to heat is increasing due to climate change, and this trend will continue. Globally, extreme temperature events are observed to be increasing in their frequency, duration, and magnitude. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people exposed to heat waves increased by around 125 million. In 2015 alone, 175 million additional people were exposed to heat waves compared to average years.  Single events can last weeks, occur consecutively, and result in significant excess mortality. In 2003, 70,000 people in Europe died as a result of the June-August event, in 2010, 56,000 excess deaths occurred during a 44-day heatwave in the Russian Federation.  Exposure to excessive heat has wide ranging physiological impacts for all humans, often amplifying existing conditions and resulting in premature death and disability.  The negative health impacts of heat are predictable and largely preventable with specific public health actions. WHO has issued public health guidance for the general public and medical professionals on coping with extreme heat. Overview Global temperatures and the frequency and intensity of heatwaves will rise in the 21st century as a result of climate change. Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperatures create cumulative physiological stress on the human body which exacerbates the top causes of death globally, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and renal disease. Heatwaves can acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public health emergencies, and result in excess mortality, and cascading socioeconomic impacts (e.g. lost work capacity and labor productivity). They can also cause loss of health service delivery capacity, where power-shortages which often accompany heatwaves disrupt health facilities, transport, and water infrastructure. Awareness remains insufficient of the health risks posed by heatwaves and prolonged exposure to increased temperatures. Health professionals must adjust their planning and interventions to account for increasing temperatures and heatwaves. Practical, feasible, and often low-cost interventions at the individual, community, organizational, governmental and societal levels, can save lives. Who is affected? Rising global ambient temperatures affect all populations. However, some populations are more exposed to, or more physiologically or socioeconomically vulnerable to physiological stress, exacerbated illness, and an increased risk of death from exposure to excess heat. These include the elderly, infants and children, pregnant women, outdoor and manual workers, athletes, and the poor. Gender can play an important role in determining heat exposure. How does heat impact health? Heat gain in the human body can be caused by a combination of external heat from the environment and internal body heat generated from metabolic processes. Rapid rises in heat gain due to exposure to hotter than average conditions compromises the body's ability to regulate temperature and can result in a cascade of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and hyperthermia.

   abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

   abstract = {Changes in the environmental heat stress need to be properly evaluated to manage the risk of heat-related illnesses, particularly in the context of climate change. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a useful index for evaluating heat stress and anticipating conditions related to heat-related illness in the present climate, but projecting the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we developed a methodological framework for estimating the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT based on the output of general circulation models using only simple calculations. The method was applied to six sites in Japan and its performance was evaluated. The proposed method could reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with a high accuracy. Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s) projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These projections showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity to perform physically demanding activities is expected to decrease. To demonstrate the usefulness of the projected WBGT in planning adaptation measures, we identified the optimal working schedules which would minimize outdoor workers’ exposure to heat at a specific site. The results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in the future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased heat exposure only by changing their working hours. This methodological framework and the projections will provide local practitioners with useful information to manage the increased risk of heat stress under climate change.},

   abstract = {This study examines the progress made by two new reanalyses in the estimation of surface irradiance: ERA5, the new global reanalysis from the ECMWF, and COSMO-REA6, the regional reanalysis from the DWD for Europe. Daily global horizontal irradiance data were evaluated with 41 BSRN stations worldwide, 294 stations in Europe, and two satellite-derived products (NSRDB and SARAH). ERA5 achieves a moderate positive bias worldwide and in Europe of +4.05 W/m2 and +4.54 W/m2 respectively, which entails a reduction in the average bias ranging from 50% to 75% compared to ERA-Interim and MERRA-2. This makes ERA5 comparable with satellite-derived products in terms of the mean bias in most inland stations, but ERA5 results degrade in coastal areas and mountains. The bias of ERA5 varies with the cloudiness, overestimating under cloudy conditions and slightly underestimating under clear-skies, which suggests a poor prediction of cloud patterns and leads to larger absolute errors than that of satellite-based products. In Europe, the regional COSMO-REA6 underestimates in most stations (MBE = −5.29 W/m2) showing the largest deviations under clear-sky conditions, which is most likely caused by the aerosol climatology used. Above 45°N the magnitude of the bias and absolute error of COSMO-REA6 are similar to ERA5 while it outperforms ERA5 in the coastal areas due to its high-resolution grid (6.2 km). We conclude that ERA5 and COSMO-REA6 have reduced the gap between reanalysis and satellite-based data, but further development is required in the prediction of clouds while the spatial grid of ERA5 (31 km) remains inadequate for places with high variability of surface irradiance (coasts and mountains). Satellite-based data should be still used when available, but having in mind their limitations, ERA5 is a valid alternative for situations in which satellite-based data are missing (polar regions and gaps in times series) while COSMO-REA6 complements ERA5 in Central and Northern Europe mitigating the limitations of ERA5 in coastal areas.},

   abstract = {In this study, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the minimum rest time for the safety of South Korean outdoor workers during hot summer months (June to August) are examined based on the hourly wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) across 27 weather stations in South Korea. The WBGT thresholds in the work-rest recommendation of the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA 2017) for the quantification of the minimum rest time are evaluated through a comparison of the given thresholds with the occurrences of occupational heat-related illness patients due to outdoor work during hot summer months in South Korea. The long-term (2009–2018) average of the hourly WBGT values during summer months shows that outdoor workers with a moderate workload are exposed to heat stress during approximately 30% of the entire daytime working hours (06:00–18:00). According to the WBGT thresholds modified from the KOSHA (2017) guidelines, the daily minimum rest time for a moderate workload noticeably increases up to 18% (11 min/h) in mid-summer (late July and early August). During mid-summer, the minimum rest time for a continuous moderate outdoor workload even increases up to 31% (18 min/h) between 12:00 and 13:00 and is regionally higher in the southwestern than in the southeastern regions of the Korean Peninsula. These results suggest that in summertime high-heat environments, a mandatory rest time must be provided according to appropriate heat management programs for the safety of workers.},

The 5-km horizontal resolution gridded forecasts issued at 0000 UTC for forecast lead times at 12-h intervals from 12 to 168 h were obtained from the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD). Forecast accuracy and skill are determined relative to observations at over 3000 locations archived by MesoWest. Forecast quality is also determined relative to Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) analyses at 20-km resolution that are interpolated to the 5-km NDFD grid as well as objective analyses obtained from the Advanced Regional Prediction System Data Assimilation System that rely upon the MesoWest observations and RUC analyses. For the West as a whole, the experimental temperature forecasts issued at 0000 UTC during the 2003/04 winter season exhibit skill at lead times of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h on the basis of several verification approaches. Subgrid-scale temperature variations and observational and analysis errors undoubtedly contribute some uncertainty regarding these results. Even though the "true" values appropriate to evaluate the forecast values on the NDFD grid are unknown, it is estimated that the root-mean-square errors of the NDFD temperature forecasts are on the order of 3°C at lead times shorter than 48 h and greater than 4°C at lead times longer than 120 h. However, such estimates are derived from only a small fraction of the NDFD grid boxes. Incremental improvements in forecast accuracy as a result of forecaster adjustments to the 0000 UTC temperature grids from 144- to 24-h lead times are estimated to be on the order of 13%. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Exertional heat stroke is one of the top three causes of death in young athletes, particularly high school football players. Despite evidence that these deaths are completely avoidable with appropriate prevention and treatment, deaths still occur at an alarming rate. Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is the preferred method of both the National Athletic Trainers’ Association and American College of Sports Medicine to measure heat intensity. Based on the WBGT, activity modification guidelines (AMG) dictate work-to-rest ratios, activity levels and duration, protective equipment worn, and length and frequency of hydration breaks. Due to the cost of handheld WBGT monitors, smartphone apps that estimate WBGT have been considered an alternative. However, it is unclear how WBGT values estimated by these smartphone apps compare to those measured on-site using handheld WBGT monitors. We compared WBGT values estimated by a commercial smartphone app to those taken on-site at the same time and place. Thirteen athletic trainers measured WBGT in the field during high school football practices over a three-month season in North Central Florida. A paired sample t-test indicated the smartphone app significantly overestimated WBGT (29.0°C ± 4.1°C) compared to on-site measures (26.4°C ± 3.2°C) (r =0.580; t(943)=-23.38, p <0.0001). The smartphone app-estimated values were consistently greater than on-site measures, resulting in potentially unnecessary activity modifications and cancellations if the app was used in place of on-site handheld WBGT monitors. Despite being significantly cheaper than handheld WBGT monitors, at this time, smartphone apps are not ready for widespread use to guide activity modification decisions.},

The novelty this year concerns that the world population will have to deal with a new situation that foresees the application of specific measures, including adjunctive personal protective equipment (i.e. facemasks and gloves), in order to reduce the potential transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These measures should help to decrease the risk of the infection transmission but will also represent an aggravating factor to counteract the heat effects on the population health both at occupational and environmental level. The use of a specific heat health warning system with personalized information based on individual, behavioural and environmental characteristics represents a necessary strategy to help a fast adaptation of the population at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

The widely used European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis products provide long-term spatial estimates of the total and direct solar radiation on an hourly scale; however, its accuracy has not been systematically evaluated for China. In this letter, in situ measurements from 98 sites are used to analyze the deviations in the hourly radiation from ERA5 and to compare the daily variations. The results reveal that estimates from the reanalysis correlate well with ground observations and completely reflect the regional characteristics and daily variations at individual sites. Overall, ERA5 overestimates the hourly total solar radiation and direct radiation by approximately 30.87 and 73.95 W/m2, respectively, whereas it underestimates the diffuse radiation by approximately 43.08 W/m2. Spatiotemporal differences are found by comparing the errors and time series of different sites. The fact that the accuracy in areas with rainy and cloudy weather is obviously lower indicates that the ERA5 analysis poorly performs when retrieving cloud properties. These conclusions can contribute to guiding the rational use of ERA5 radiation products.},

   abstract = {The recent release of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) HXG cloud products and new ERA5 reanalysis data enabled us to produce a global surface solar radiation (SSR) dataset: a 16-year (2000-2015) high-resolution (3 h, 10 km) global SSR dataset using an improved physical parameterization scheme. The main inputs were cloud optical depth from ISCCP-HXG cloud products; the water vapor, surface pressure and ozone from ERA5 reanalysis data; and albedo and aerosol from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The estimated SSR data were evaluated against surface observations measured at 42 stations of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and 90 radiation stations of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). Validation against the BSRN data indicated that the mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) for the instantaneous SSR estimates at 10 km scale were -11.5 W m-2, 113.5 W m-2 and 0.92, respectively. When the estimated instantaneous SSR data were upscaled to 90 km, its error was clearly reduced, with RMSE decreasing to 93.4 W m-2 and R increasing to 0.95. For daily SSR estimates at 90 km scale, the MBE, RMSE and R at the BSRN were -5.8 W m-2, 33.1 W m-2 and 0.95, respectively. These error metrics at the CMA radiation stations were 2.1 W m-2, 26.9 W m-2 and 0.95, respectively. Comparisons with other global satellite radiation products indicated that our SSR estimates were generally better than those of the ISCCP flux dataset (ISCCP-FD), the global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget (GEWEX-SRB), and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). Our SSR dataset will contribute to the land-surface process simulations and the photovoltaic applications in the future.

LDAS-Monde ingests satellite-derived surface soil moisture (SSM) and leaf area index (LAI) estimates to constrain the interactions between soil, biosphere, and atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM) coupled with the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques) version of the total runoff integrating pathways (CTRIP) continental hydrological system (ISBA-CTRIP). LDAS-Monde is forced by the ERA-5 atmospheric reanalysis from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from 2010 to 2016 leading to a seven-year, quarter degree spatial resolution offline reanalysis of land surface variables (LSVs) over CONUS. The impact of assimilating LAI and SSM into LDAS-Monde is assessed over North America, by comparison to satellite-driven model estimates of land evapotranspiration from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) project, and upscaled ground-based observations of gross primary productivity from the FLUXCOM project. Taking advantage of the relatively dense data networks over CONUS, we have also evaluated the impact of the assimilation against in situ measurements of soil moisture from the USCRN (US Climate Reference Network), together with river discharges from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC). Those data sets highlight the added value of assimilating satellite derived observations compared with an open-loop simulation (i.e., no assimilation). It is shown that LDAS-Monde has the ability not only to monitor land surface variables but also to forecast them, by providing improved initial conditions, which impacts persist through time. LDAS-Monde reanalysis also has the potential to be used to monitor extreme events like agricultural drought. Finally, limitations related to LDAS-Monde and current satellite-derived observations are exposed as well as several insights on how to use alternative datasets to analyze soil moisture and vegetation state.},

Accordingly, besides poor hydration status, the primary determinants of reduced performance and exertional heat-illness risk in youth during sports and other physical activities in a hot environment include undue physical exertion, insufficient recovery between repeated exercise bouts or closely scheduled same-day training sessions or rounds of sports competition, and inappropriately wearing clothing, uniforms, and protective equipment that play a role in excessive heat retention. Because these known contributing risk factors are modifiable, exertional heat illness is usually preventable.

   abstract = {<p>Background and objectives: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) continues to be a prevalent health issue affecting all athletes, including our pediatric populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a state policy requirement for EHS prevention and treatment on local high school policy adoption in the United States (US). Materials and Methods: Athletic trainers (ATs) from high schools across the US participated in an online survey (n = 365). This survey inquired about their compliance with nine components of an EHS policy which was then compared to their state requirements for the policies. Evaluation of the number of components adopted between states with a requirement versus states without a requirement was conducted with a Wilcoxon Sign Rank test. Finally, an ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were run to determine the effect of a state requirement and regional differences on the number of components adopted. Results: ATs working in states with a requirement reported adoption of more components in their heat modification policy compared to states that did not require schools to develop a heat modification policy (with requirement mean = 5.34 ± 3.68, median = 7.0; without requirement mean = 4.23 ± 3.59, median = 5.0; Z = −14.88, p &lt; 0.001). ATs working in region 3 (e.g., hotter regions) reported adopting more components than those in region 1 (e.g., cooler regions) (OR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.215–4.201, p = 0.010). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a positive association between state policy requirements and subsequently increased local policy adoption for EHS policies. Additionally, the results demonstrate that regional differences exist, calling for the need for reducing disparities across the US. These findings may imply that policy adoption is a multifactorial process; furthermore, additional regional specific investigations must be conducted to determine the true determinants of high school policy adoption rates for EHS policies.</p>},

METHODS: We reviewed a subset of HRI enforcement investigations conducted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) from 2011 through 2016. We assessed characteristics of the workers, employers, and events. We stratified cases by severity to assess whether risk factors were more prevalent in fatal HRIs. RESULTS: We analyzed 38 investigations involving 66 HRIs. Many workers had predisposing medical conditions or used predisposing medications. Comorbidities were more prevalent in workers who died. Most (73%) fatal HRIs occurred during the first week on the job. Common clinical findings in heat stroke cases included multiorgan failure, muscle breakdown, and systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Severe HRI is more likely when personal susceptibilities coexist with work-related and environmental risk factors. Almost all HRIs occur when employers do not adhere to preventive guidelines.},

Objective: To discuss the development of the Georgia High School Association heat policy and assess the effectiveness of revised guidelines. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Georgia high schools. Patients or Other Participants: Interscholastic football players in grades 9 through 12. Main Outcome Measure(s): Heat syncope and heat exhaustion (HS/HE) illness rates (IRs) were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), and relative risk (RR) was calculated as a ratio of postpolicy (POST) IR divided by prepolicy (PRE) IR. Results: A total of 214 HS/HE cases (172 PRE, 42 POST) and 341 348 AEs (178 230 PRE, 163 118 POST) were identified. During the first 5 days of the PRE period, approximately 50% of HS/HE illnesses occurred; HS/HE IRs doubled when practice sessions increased from 2 to 2.5 hours and tripled for practices ≥3 hours. The HS/HE IRs in the PRE period increased from 0.44/1000 AEs for wet-bulb globe temperatures (WBGTs) of,828F (,27.88C) to .2.0/1000 AEs for WBGTs from 878F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C). The RRs comparing PRE and POST policy periods were 0.29 for WBGTs of,82.08F (,27.808C), 0.65 for WBGTs from 82.08F (27.88C) to 86.98F (30.58C), and 0.23 for WBGTs from 87.08F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C). No HS/HE illnesses occurred in the POST period for WBGTs at .908F (.32.38C). Conclusions: Results from the PRE period guided the Georgia High School Association to revise its heat and humidity policy to include a mandated 5-day acclimatization period when no practices may exceed 2 hours and the use of WBGT-based activity-modification categories. The new policy reduced HS/HE IRs by 35% to 100%, depending on the WBGT category. Our results may be generalizable to other states with hot and humid climates similar to that of Georgia.},

   abstract = {Regular physical activity supports healthy human functioning1–3. Might climate change—by modifying the environmental determinants of human physical activity—alter exercise rates in the future4? Here we conduct an empirical investigation of the relationship between meteorological conditions, physical activity and future climate change. Using data on reported participation in recreational physical activity from over 1.9 million US survey respondents between 2002 and 2012, coupled with daily meteorological data, we show that both cold and acutely hot temperatures, as well as precipitation days, reduce physical activity. We combine our historical estimates with output from 21 climate models and project the possible physical activity effects of future climatic changes by 2050 and 2099. Our projection indicates that warming over the course of this century may increase net recreational physical activity in the United States. Activity may increase most during the winter in northern states and decline most during the summer in southern states. Obradovich and Fowler use data on participation in physical activity from 1.9 million US residents from 2002–2012, coupled with daily temperature data, to show that unmitigated climate change is likely to alter future patterns of physical activity.},

   abstract = {Background: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R. Methods: In this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions. Results: We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results. Conclusions: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.},

   abstract = {Background: Childhood growth is a cornerstone of pediatric research. Statistical models need to consider individual trajectories to adequately describe growth outcomes. Specifically, well-defined longitudinal models are essential to characterize both population and subject-specific growth. Linear mixed-effect models with cubic regression splines can account for the nonlinearity of growth curves and provide reasonable estimators of population and subject-specific growth, velocity and acceleration. Methods: We provide a stepwise approach that builds from simple to complex models, and account for the intrinsic complexity of the data. We start with standard cubic splines regression models and build up to a model that includes subject-specific random intercepts and slopes and residual autocorrelation. We then compared cubic regression splines vis-à-vis linear piecewise splines, and with varying number of knots and positions. Statistical code is provided to ensure reproducibility and improve dissemination of methods. Models are applied to longitudinal height measurements in a cohort of 215 Peruvian children followed from birth until their fourth year of life. Results: Unexplained variability, as measured by the variance of the regression model, was reduced from 7.34 when using ordinary least squares to 0.81 (p < 0.001) when using a linear mixed-effect models with random slopes and a first order continuous autoregressive error term. There was substantial heterogeneity in both the intercept (p < 0.001) and slopes (p < 0.001) of the individual growth trajectories. We also identified important serial correlation within the structure of the data (ρ = 0.66; 95 % CI 0.64 to 0.68; p < 0.001), which we modeled with a first order continuous autoregressive error term as evidenced by the variogram of the residuals and by a lack of association among residuals. The final model provides a parametric linear regression equation for both estimation and prediction of population- and individual-level growth in height. We show that cubic regression splines are superior to linear regression splines for the case of a small number of knots in both estimation and prediction with the full linear mixed effect model (AIC 19,352 vs. 19,598, respectively). While the regression parameters are more complex to interpret in the former, we argue that inference for any problem depends more on the estimated curve or differences in curves rather than the coefficients. Moreover, use of cubic regression splines provides biological meaningful growth velocity and acceleration curves despite increased complexity in coefficient interpretation. Conclusions: Through this stepwise approach, we provide a set of tools to model longitudinal childhood data for non-statisticians using linear mixed-effect models.},

   abstract = {fact that the WBGT index values need to be increased in tropical environments due to the underestimation of sweat rate and rate of evaporation. Acclimatisation does however reduce the differences in physiological strain experienced at equivalent WBGT heat stress index levels with different humidity levels. 7 Increased thermal load that is placed on employees may increase the risk for heat related illnesses. Performance of employees can also be affected due to the relationship that exists between percentage dehydration and performance. 8 It is therefore important that proper guidelines be drafted to allow accurate implementation of the WBGT heat stress index in hot wet conditions to protect the workforce and employers. The guidelines should provide correction factors and threshold temperatures to protect the health of the employees. Other protective approaches that are used are to screen employees for heat intolerance or to implement practices to ensure that employees at risk to develop heat related illnesses, are not allowed in the workplace. Educating the workforce concerning the dangers of heat illnesses, the importance of maintaining optimal hydration status during work and self pacing is still the most effective way to prevent heat illnesses. 9 This study was therefore conducted to determine the influence of two relative humidity levels on a range of equivalent WBGT heat stress index values on physiological responses known to be good indicators of thermal heat strain. METHODS Healthy un-acclimatised young men (N=16) were used. They underwent a medical screening that included a cardiovascular examination, and were declared fit to take part in the study. Informed consent was obtained from each subject and they were aware that they could withdraw from the experiment without any penalty. The physical characteristics of the test subjects are depicted in Table 1. Test subjects were individually calibrated using open circuit spirometry to complete work at an oxygen consumption of 1.34 L.min-1 with the application of a standardised step test protocol. This protocol required subjects to step at a rate of 18 steps.min-1 for 9 minutes onto stepping heights of 20, 25, 30 and 35 cm respectively. A linear regression was calculated between oxygen consumption and stepping height to determine required stepping height for each subject that would yield an oxygen consumption of 1.34 L.min-1. The metabolic rate of the subjects was 450 watts, which is representative of activities such as loading a wheelbarrow with stones and mortar, hand moulding medium sized pieces, sawing (40 double pulls.min-1) and stripping of bark. 10},

Participants wore a personal heat exposure sensor over 7 days from June 1st to July 3rd, 2015 in Tallahassee, Florida US. Next, participants confirmed the days that they wore the sensor and reported their daily thermal comfort and heat adaptations. Finally, participants completed an extreme heat knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. Some participants (37%) experienced hotter and more humid conditions (heat index > 2) than the weather station. The most common heat adaptations were staying hydrated (85%), wearing a hat (46%), and seeking shade (40%). During work hours, higher temperatures increased the odds (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.03–1.41, p = 0.016) of a participant feeling too hot. Shifting work duty indoors made workers to feel more comfortable (odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.11–0.70, p = 0.005).

However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

CDC's Emergency Operations Center collaborated with state health departments in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina to collect and analyze Hurricane Irma-related mortality data to understand the main circumstances of death. The most common circumstance-of-death categories were exacerbation of existing medical conditions and power outage. Further analysis revealed two unique subcategories of heat-related and oxygen-dependent deaths in which power outage contributed to exacerbation of an existing medical condition. Understanding the need for subcategorization of disaster-related circumstances of death and the possibility of overlapping categories can help public health practitioners derive more effective public health interventions to prevent deaths in future disasters.},

   abstract = {Weather and climate affect many ecological processes, making spatially continuous yet fine-resolution weather data desirable for ecological research and predictions. Numerous downscaled weather data sets exist, but little attempt has been made to evaluate them systematically. Here we address this shortcoming by focusing on four major questions: (1) How accurate are downscaled, gridded climate data sets in terms of temperature and precipitation estimates? (2) Are there significant regional differences in accuracy among data sets? (3) How accurate are their mean values compared with extremes? (4) Does their accuracy depend on spatial resolution? We compared eight widely used downscaled data sets that provide gridded daily weather data for recent decades across the United States. We found considerable differences among data sets and between downscaled and weather station data. Temperature is represented more accurately than precipitation, and climate averages are more accurate than weather extremes. The data set exhibiting the best agreement with station data varies among ecoregions. Surprisingly, the accuracy of the data sets does not depend on spatial resolution. Although some inherent differences among data sets and weather station data are to be expected, our findings highlight how much different interpolation methods affect downscaled weather data, even for local comparisons with nearby weather stations located inside a grid cell. More broadly, our results highlight the need for careful consideration among different available data sets in terms of which variables they describe best, where they perform best, and their resolution, when selecting a downscaled weather data set for a given ecological application.},

The NLCD 2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and pre-processing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.},

   abstract = {It is well known that remote sensing techniques hold the potential to explore the spatial estimation of air temperature (T a) with fine spatial and temporal resolution across the world. However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere system and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime T a exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime T a under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous T a under clear sky conditions (T a,clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (T a S) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (T s) retrieved from MOD06_L2 product. Then a regression model between T a,clear and T s was established, and the instantaneous T a under cloudy sky conditions (T a,cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to T s retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of T a,clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 °C, RMSE = 2.50 °C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 °C, RMSE = 2.56 °C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The T a,cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with T a observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 °C and 2.91 °C, respectively. The accuracy of both T a,clear and T a,cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional statistical approaches that adopt ancillary T a measurements as training dataset. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime T a under all-weather conditions entirely based on MODIS products.

This chapter reviews the present scientific understanding of diurnal mountain wind systems, focusing on research findings published since 1988. Slope flows are examined first, as they provide a good introduction to the many factors affecting diurnal mountain wind systems. The energy budgets governing slope flows; the effects of turbulence, slope angle, ambient stability, background flows and slope inhomogeneities on slope flows; and the methods used to simulate slope flows are examined. Then, valley winds are reviewed in a similar manner and the diurnal phases of valley and slope winds and their interactions are summarized. Recent research on large-scale mountain-plain wind systems is reviewed, with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountains and the Alps. Winds occurring in closed basins and over plateaus are then discussed, and analogies between the two wind systems are outlined. This is followed by a discussion of forecasting considerations for diurnal mountain wind systems. Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary of open questions and productive areas for further research.},

   abstract = {The objective of this work is to better understand and summarize the mountain meteorological observations collected during the Science of Nowcasting Winter Weather for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympics (SNOW-V10) project that was supported by the Fog Remote Sensing and Modeling (FRAM) project. The Roundhouse (RND) meteorological station was located 1,856 m above sea level that is subject to the winter extreme weather conditions. Below this site, there were three additional observation sites at 1,640, 1,320, and 774 m. These four stations provided some or all the following measurements at 1 min resolution: precipitation rate (PR) and amount, cloud/fog microphysics, 3D wind speed (horizontal wind speed, U
                h; vertical air velocity, w
                a), visibility (Vis), infrared (IR) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes, temperature (T) and relative humidity with respect to water (RHw), and aerosol observations. In this work, comparisons are made to assess the uncertainties and variability for the measurements of Vis, RHw, T, PR, and wind for various winter weather conditions. The ground-based cloud imaging probe (GCIP) measurements of snow particles using a profiling microwave radiometer (PMWR) data have also been shown to assess the icing conditions. Overall, the conclusions suggest that uncertainties in the measurements of Vis, PR, T, and RH can be as large as 50, >60, 50, and >20 %, respectively, and these numbers may increase depending on U
                h, T, Vis, and PR magnitude. Variability of observations along the Whistler Mountain slope (~500 m) suggested that to verify the models, model space resolution should be better than 100 m and time scales better than 1 min. It is also concluded that differences between observed and model based parameters are strongly related to a model’s capability of accurate prediction of liquid water content (LWC), PR, and RHw over complex topography.},

   abstract = {Understanding and managing the health effects of ambient temperature (Ta) in a warming, urbanizing world requires spatially- and temporally-resolved Ta at high resolutions. This is challenging in a large area like France which includes highly variable topography, rural areas with few weather stations, and heterogeneous urban areas where Ta can vary at fine spatial scales. We have modeled daily Ta from 2000 to 2016 at a base resolution of 1 km2 across continental France and at a 200 × 200 m2 resolution over large urban areas. For each day we predict three Ta measures: minimum (Tmin), mean (Tmean), and maximum (Tmax). We start by using linear mixed models to calibrate daily Ta observations from weather stations with remotely sensed MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and other spatial predictors (e.g. NDVI, elevation) on a 1 km2 grid. We fill gaps where LST is missing (e.g. due to cloud cover) with additional mixed models that capture the relationship between predicted Ta at each location and observed Ta at nearby weather stations. The resulting 1 km Ta models perform very well, with ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.92, 0.97, and 0.95, mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 °C, 0.9 °C, and 1.4 °C, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.9 °C, 1.3 °C, and 1.8 °C (Tmin, Tmean, and Tmax, respectively) for the initial calibration stage. To increase the spatial resolution over large urban areas, we train random forest and extreme gradient boosting models to predict the residuals (R) of the 1 km Ta predictions on a 200 × 200 m2 grid. In this stage we replace MODIS LST and NDVI with composited top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature and NDVI from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellites. We use a generalized additive model to ensemble the random forest and extreme gradient boosting predictions with weights that vary spatially and by the magnitude of the predicted residual. The 200 m models also perform well, with ten-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85, MAE of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, and RMSE of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.5 (Rmin, Rmean, and Rmax, respectively). Our model will reduce bias in epidemiological studies in France by improving Ta exposure assessment in both urban and rural areas, and our methodology demonstrates that MODIS and Landsat thermal data can be used to generate gap-free timeseries of daily minimum, maximum, and mean Ta at a 200 × 200 m2 spatial resolution.},

   abstract = {An evaluation of the global ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis ERA-Interim (with a 0.5 • grid) is performed over France, based on the high resolution (8 km) SAFRAN atmospheric reanalysis. The ERA-Interim precipitation, Incoming Solar Radiation (ISR), air temperature, air humidity, and wind speed, are compared with their SAFRAN counterparts. Also, interpolated in situ ISR observations are used in order to consolidate the evaluation of this variable. The daily precipitation estimates produced by ERA-Interim over France correlate very well with SAFRAN. However, the values are underestimated by 27%. A GPCP-corrected version of ERA-Interim is less biased (13%). The ERA-Interim estimates of ISR correlate very well with SAFRAN and with in situ observations on a daily basis. Whereas SAFRAN underestimates the ISR by 6 Wm −2 , ERA-Interim overestimates the ISR by 10 Wm −2. In order to assess the impact of the ERA-Interim errors, simulations of the ISBA-A-gs land surface model are performed over the SMOSREX grassland site in southwestern France using ERA-Interim (with and without GPCP rescaling) and SAFRAN. Latent and sensible heat fluxes are simulated, together with carbon dioxide fluxes. The rescaled ERA-Interim performs better than the original ERA-Interim and permits to achieve flux scores similar to those obtained with SAFRAN.},

   abstract = {Mountains, through atmospheric processes, play an integrated role in weather systems and climate systems. In turn, weather and climate over and nearby mountains are modified depending on environmental conditions. Mountain size, shape, slope, aspect ratio, and orientation along the water sources affect the weather systems; they can intensify fronts, eddies, vortex, rotors and turbulence, visibility, and precipitation. Depending on their location and height, precipitation type as snow over the mountains contributes significantly to hydrometeorological cycle and ecosystem. Increasing temperatures because of a possible climate change can reduce river discharges during warm seasons. Therefore, accurate measurements of climate change impact on the mountains are required. On the other hand, obtaining measurements over the mountainous regions are extremely difficult because of strong winds, cold temperatures (<0°C), mountain slopes, and heavy snow precipitation as well as instrumental issues. New developments on measurement strategies and instruments, and developing multiscale numerical models with detailed cloud microphysical processes and boundary layer parameterizations can reduce uncertainties in the weather and climate prediction. In this review, the challenges related to collecting measurements, numerical model predictions, and climate change issues over and nearby mountains will be emphasized.},

   abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of surface temperature trends to land use land cover change (LULC) over the conterminous United States (CONUS) using the observation minus reanalysis (OMR) approach. We estimated the OMR trends for the 1979-2003 period from the US Historical Climate Network (USHCN), and the NCEP-NCAR North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). We used a new mean square differences (MSDs)-based assessment for the comparisons between temperature anomalies from observations and interpolated reanalysis data. Trends of monthly mean temperature anomalies show a strong agreement, especially between adjusted USHCN and NARR (r = 0.9 on average) and demonstrate that NARR captures the climate variability at different time scales. OMR trend results suggest that, unlike findings from studies based on the global reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR reanalysis), NARR often has a larger warming trend than adjusted observations (on average, 0.28 and 0.27 °C/decade respectively).OMR trends were found to be sensitive to land cover types. We analysed decadal OMR trends as a function of land types using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and new National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 1992-2001 Retrofit Land Cover Change. The magnitude of OMR trends obtained from the NLDC is larger than the one derived from the 'static' AVHRR. Moreover, land use conversion often results in more warming than cooling.Overall, our results confirm the robustness of the OMR method for detecting non-climatic changes at the station level, evaluating the impacts of adjustments performed on raw observations, and most importantly, providing a quantitative estimate of additional warming trends associated with LULC changes at local and regional scales. As most of the warming trends that we identify can be explained on the basis of LULC changes, we suggest that in addition to considering the greenhouse gases-driven radiative forcings, multi-decadal and longer climate models simulations must further include LULC changes.

   abstract = {A radar-based climatology of 91 unique summertime (May 2000-August 2009) thunderstorm cases was examined over the Indianapolis, Indiana, urban area. The study hypothesis is that urban regions alter the intensity and composition/structure of approaching thunderstorms because of land surface heterogeneity. Storm characteristics were studied over the Indianapolis region and four peripheral rural counties approximately 120 km away from the urban center. Using radar imagery, the time of event, changes in storm structure (splitting, initiation, intensification, and dissipation), synoptic setting, orientation, and motion were studied. It was found thatmore than 60%of storms changed structure over the Indianapolis area as compared with only 25%over the rural regions. Furthermore, daytime convection was most likely to be affected, with 71% of storms changing structure as compared with only 42%at night. Analysis of radar imagery indicated that storms split closer to the upwind urban region and merge again downwind. Thus, a larger portion of small storms (50-200 km2) and large storms (>1500 km2) were found downwind of the urban region, whereas midsized storms (200-1500 km) dominated the upwind region. A case study of a typical storm on 13 June 2005 was examined using available observations and the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-NCARMesoscale Model (MM5), version 3.7.2. Two simulations were performed with and without the urban land use/Indianapolis region in the fourth domain (1.33-km resolution). The storm of interest could not be simulated without the urban area. Results indicate that removing the Indianapolis urban region caused distinct differences in the regional convergence and convection as well as in simulated base reflectivity, surface energy balance (through sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and virtual potential temperature changes), and boundary layer structure. Study results indicate that the urban area has a strong climatological influence on regional thunderstorms. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Surface winds have declined in China, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the United States and Australia over the past few decades. The precise cause of the stilling is uncertain. Here, we analyse the extent and potential cause of changes in surface wind speeds over the northern mid-latitudes between 1979 and 2008, using data from 822 surface weather stations. We show that surface wind speeds have declined by 5g-15% over almost all continental areas in the northern mid-latitudes, and that strong winds have slowed faster than weak winds. In contrast, upper-air winds calculated from sea-level pressure gradients, and winds from weather reanalyses, exhibited no such trend. Changes in atmospheric circulation that are captured by reanalysis data explain 10g-50% of the surface wind slowdown. In addition, mesoscale model simulations suggest that an increase in surface roughnessg-the magnitude of which is estimated from increases in biomass and land-use change in Eurasiag-could explain between 25 and 60% of the stilling. Moreover, regions of pronounced stilling generally coincided with regions where biomass has increased over the past 30 years, supporting the role of vegetation increases in wind slowdown. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

   abstract = {Land use practices have replaced much of the natural needleleaf evergreen, broadleaf deciduous, and mixed forests of the Eastern United States with crops. To a lesser extent, the natural grasslands in the Central United States have also been replaced with crops. Simulations with a land surface process model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model show that the climate of the United States with modern vegetation is significantly different from that with natural vegetation. Three important climate signals caused by modern vegetation are: (1) 1 °C cooling over the Eastern United States and 1 °C warming over the Western United States in spring; (2) summer cooling of up to 2°C over a wide region of the Central United States; and (3) moistening of the near-surface atmosphere by 0.5 to 1.5 g kg-1 over much of the United States in spring and summer. Although individual months show large, statistically significant differences in precipitation due to land-use practices, these differences average out over the course of the 3-month seasons. These changes in surface temperature and moisture extend well into the atmosphere, up to 500 mb, and affect the boundary layer and atmospheric circulation. The altered climate is due to reduced surface roughness, reduced leaf and stem area index, reduced stomatal resistance, and increased surface albedo with modern vegetation compared to natural vegetation. The climate change caused by land use practices is comparable to other well known anthropogenic climate forcings. For example, it would take 100 to 175 years at the current, observed rate of summer warming over the United States to offset the cooling from deforestation. The summer sulfate aerosol forcing completely offsets the greenhouse forcing over the Eastern United States. Similarly, the climatic effect of North American deforestation, with extensive summer cooling, further offsets the greenhouse forcing.},

   abstract = {In the numerous forms of analysis of variance (ANOVA) discussed in previ-ous chapters, variance components were estimated by equating observed mean squares to expressions describing their expected values, these being functions of the variance components. ANOVA has the nice feature that the estimators for the variance components are unbiased regardless of whether the data are normally distributed, but it also has two significant limitations. First, field observations often yield records on a variety of relatives, such as offspring, parents, or sibs, that cannot be analyzed jointly with ANOVA. Second, ANOVA estimates of vari-ance components require that sample sizes be well balanced, with the number of observations for each set of conditions being essentially equal. In field situations, individuals are often lost, and even the most carefully crafted balanced design can quickly collapse into an extremely unbalanced one. Although modifications to the ANOVA sums of squares have been proposed to account for unbalanced data (Henderson 1953, Searle et al. 1992), their sampling properties are poorly understood. Unlike ANOVA estimators, maximum likelihood (ML) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimators do not place any special demands on the design or balance of data. Such estimates are ideal for the unbalanced designs that arise in quantitative genetics, as they can be obtained readily for any arbitrary pedigree of individuals. Since many aspects of ML and REML estimation are quite difficult technically, the detailed mathematics can obscure the general power and flexibility of the methods. Therefore, our main concern is to make the theory more accessible to the nonspecialist, and as a consequence, we are not as thorough in our coverage of the literature as in previous chapters. Also, unlike elsewhere in this book, we occasionally rely upon mathematical machinery (such as matrix derivatives) that is not fully developed here (see Appendix 3 for an introduction). This chapter is mathematically difficult in places, and the reader will do well to review some of the advanced topics in Chapter 8 (such as the multivariate normal and expectations of quadratic products) and Appendix 4. We start at a relatively elementary level, providing a simple example to show how ML and REML procedures can be used to estimate variance components and how these estimates differ. We then develop the ML and REML equations for variance-component estimation under the general mixed model (introduced in Chapter 26). Extension of these methods to multiple traits, wherein full covariance matrices, rather than single variance components, must be estimated, are then reviewed. We conclude our coverage of ML/REML by examining a number of computational methods for solving the ML/REML equations.},

   abstract = {This paper analyses the spatial and temporal variability of winter droughts in a semi-arid geographic gradient in Northeast Spain, from the Pyrenees in the north to the Mediterranean coastland in the south. Droughts that occurred between 1952 and 1999 were analysed by means of the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI). The influence of the weather-type frequency and of the general North Atlantic atmospheric circulation patterns was analysed. The results indicate that winter droughts show an important spatial variability in the study area, differentiating three well-defined patterns. These correspond to the Pyrenees, the centre of the Ebro Valley, and the Mediterranean coastland. General negative trends in winter SPI have been found, which are indicative of the increase in winter drought conditions in the study area. Nevertheless, important spatial differences have also been recorded. Dominant north–south gradients in the influence of weather types are shown. Moreover, the negative trends in winter-SPI values agree with the negative trend in the frequency of the weather types prone to cause precipitation, such as the C, SW and W weather types and the increase in the frequency of A weather types. Nevertheless, in the Mediterranean coastland, the positive trend in SPI values agrees with the increase in the frequency of weather types of the east (E, SE), which are prone to cause precipitation in this area. Interannual variations in the frequency of the different weather types have been highly determined by different general atmospheric circulation patterns, mainly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Nevertheless, the correlation between the time series of weather-type frequency and the winter SPI is higher than that found between the SPI and the NAO. Thus, although the interannual NAO variability explains a high percentage of the interannual differences in the frequency of different weather types, it is not sufficient to explain the spatial and temporal variability of droughts, which respond better to atmospheric variability at more detailed (synoptic) spatial scales.},

   abstract = {Land plays a critical role in both economic and environmental accounting. As an asset, it occupies a unique position at the intersection of the System of National Accounts (SNA), the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF), and (as a spatial unit) SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA), making land a natural starting point for developing natural capital accounts more generally. We develop a pilot set of national and subnational land accounts for the United States that are consistent with the SEEA-CF and SNA principles, quantified in both physical and monetary terms. The physical accounts utilize detailed land use (National Land Use Database) and land cover (National Land Cover Database) datasets, which provide insights into how land cover in the U.S. is changing over time. To provide aggregate estimates of land values, we use a hedonic approach that exploits fine-grain microdata (“big data” from Zillow) that contains detailed information from hundreds of millions of property transactions and their corresponding physical characteristics covering much of the U.S. Methodologically, we show that it is feasible to produce monetary accounts for land that can be directly linked to and integrated with physical land cover/use. Overall, U.S. land cover has shown declines in forests, cropland, and pasture with increases in barren, scrub/shrub, and developed classes, which are particularly concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Nominal land values in the U.S. fell about 28% ($7 trillion) from the boom to bust periods in the prior decade, albeit with substantial regional variation, and have subsequently experienced a nearly full recovery in recent years. We estimate private land in the contiguous 48 states to be worth approximately $25.1 trillion in 2016.},

We modeled these using information from the American Housing Survey for 2003–2013 and 140 US core-based statistical areas employing variables that would be present in publicly available parcel records. We present random-intercept logistic regression models with either cenAC, rmAC or “home was uncomfortably cold for 24 h or more” (tooCold) as outcome variables and housing value, rented vs. owned, age, and multi- vs. single-family, each interacted with cooling- or heating-degree days as predictors. The out-of-sample predicted probabilities for years 2015–2017 were compared with corresponding American Housing Survey values (0 or 1). Using a 0.5 probability threshold, the model had 63% specificity (true negative rate), and 91% sensitivity (true positive rate) for cenAC, while specificity and sensitivity for rmAC were 94% and 34%, respectively. Area-specific sensitivities and specificities varied widely. For tooCold, the overall sensitivity was effectively 0%. Future epidemiologic studies, heat vulnerability maps, and intervention screenings may reliably use these or similar AC models with parcel-level data to improve understanding of health risk and the spatial patterning of homes without AC.},

Using detailed information from 1 million trips recorded by a bike-sharing system in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this paper investigates the direct behavioral impact of heat warnings on cycling trips. The results show substantial avoidance behavior for female cyclists and older users: the number of trips for those groups decreases following a heat warning.

   abstract = {Background: Environmental heat exposure is a public health concern. The impacts of environmental heat on mortality and morbidity at the population scale are well documented, but little is known about specific exposures that individuals experience. Objectives: The first objective of this work was to catalyze discussion of the role of personal heat exposure information in research and risk assessment. The second objective was to provide guidance regarding the operationalization of personal heat exposure research methods. Discussion: We define personal heat exposure as realized contact between a person and an indoor or outdoor environment that poses a risk of increases in body core temperature and/or perceived discomfort. Personal heat exposure can be measured directly with wearable monitors or estimated indirectly through the combination of time-activity and meteorological data sets. Complementary information to understand individual-scale drivers of behavior, susceptibility, and health and comfort outcomes can be collected from additional monitors, surveys, interviews, ethnographic approaches, and additional social and health data sets. Personal exposure research can help reveal the extent of exposure misclassification that occurs when individual exposure to heat is estimated using ambient temperature measured at fixed sites and can provide insights for epidemiological risk assessment concerning extreme heat. Conclusions: Personal heat exposure research provides more valid and precise insights into how often people encounter heat conditions and when, where, to whom, and why these encounters occur. Published literature on personal heat exposure is limited to date, but existing studies point to opportunities to inform public health practice regarding extreme heat, particularly where fine-scale precision is needed to reduce health consequences of heat exposure.},

   abstract = {Background: Extreme heat is an important public health risk. Climate change will likely increase the temperatures humans are exposed to through exacerbated heat wave intensity and frequency, possibly increasing health risks from heat. To prevent adverse effects on human health, heat prevention plans and climate change adaptation strategies are being implemented. But are these measures effectively reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity? This study assesses the evidence base in 2014. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed published literature. We applied a combined search strategy of automated search and journal content search using the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses A&I. Quality appraisal was conducted using CASP checklists, and we identified recurrent themes in studies with content analysis methodology. We conducted sub-group analyses for two types of studies: survey and interview research on behavioral change and perception, and observational studies with regression. Results: 30 articles were included in the review. The majority of studies (n = 17) assessed mortality or morbidity reductions with regression analysis. Overall, the assessments report a reduction of adverse effects during extreme heat in places where preventive measures have been implemented. Population perception and behavior change were assessed in five studies, none of which had carried out a pre-test. Two themes emerged from the review: methodological challenges are a major hindrance to rigorous evaluation, and what counts as proof of an effective reduction in adverse health outcomes is disputed. Conclusions: Attributing health outcomes to heat adaptation remains a challenge. Recent study designs are less rigorous due to difficulties assigning the counterfactual. While sensitivity to heat is decreasing, the examined studies provide inconclusive evidence on individual planned adaptation measures.},

   abstract = {The demand for spatial climate data in digital form has risen dramatically in recent years. In response to this need, a variety of statistical techniques have been used to facilitate the production of GIS-compatible climate maps. However, observational data are often too sparse and unrepresentative to directly support the creation of high-quality climate maps and data sets that truly represent the current state of knowledge. An effective approach is to use the wealth of expert knowledge on the spatial patterns of climate and their relationships with geographic features, termed 'geospatial climatology', to help enhance, control, and parameterize a statistical technique. Described here is a dynamic knowledge-based framework that allows for the effective accumulation, application, and refinement of climatic knowledge, as expressed in a statistical regression model known as PRISM (parameter-elevation regressions on independent slopes model). The ultimate goal is to develop an expert system capable of reproducing the process a knowledgeable climatologist would use to create high-quality climate maps, with the added benefits of consistency and repeatability. However, knowledge must first be accumulated and evaluated through an ongoing process of model application; development of knowledge prototypes, parameters and parameter settings; testing; evaluation; and modification. This paper describes the current state of a knowledge-based framework for climate mapping and presents specific algorithms from PRISM to demonstrate how this framework is applied and refined to accommodate difficult climate mapping situations. A weighted climate-elevation regression function acknowledges the dominant influence of elevation on climate. Climate stations are assigned weights that account for other climatically important factors besides elevation. Aspect and topographic exposure, which affect climate at a variety of scales, from hill slope to windward and leeward sides of mountain ranges, are simulated by dividing the terrain into topographic facets. A coastal proximity measure is used to account for sharp climatic gradients near coastlines. A 2-layer model structure divides the atmosphere into a lower boundary layer and an upper free atmosphere layer, allowing the simulation of temperature inversions, as well as mid-slope precipitation maxima. The effectiveness of various terrain configurations at producing orographic precipitation enhancement is also estimated. Climate mapping examples are presented.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence that heat waves can result in both increased deaths and illness is subs tantial, and concern over this issue is rising because of climate change. Adverse health impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic studies have identified specific population and community characteristics that mark vulnerability to heat waves. OBJECTIVES: We situated vulnerability to heat in geographic space and identified potential areas for intervention and further research. METHODS: We mapped and analyzed 10 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality in the United States: six demographic characteristics and two household air conditioning variables from the U.S. Census Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and diabetes prevalence from a national survey. We performed a factor analysis of these 10 variables and assigned values of increasing vulnerability for the four resulting factors to each of 39,794 census tracts. We added the four factor scores to obtain a cumulative heat vulnerability index value. RESULTS: Four factors explained > 75% of the total variance in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a) social/environmental vulnerability (combined education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation, c) air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion elderly/diabetes. We found substantial spatial variability of heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher vulnerability in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the lowest in the Southeast. In urban areas, inner cities showed the highest vulnerability to heat. CONCLUSIONS: These methods provide a template for making local and regional heat vulnerability maps. After validation using health outcome data, interventions can be targeted at the most vulnerable populations.},

Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme heat-health risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability. © 2012.},

   abstract = {The distribution of overall temperature and the frequency of heat waves may be shifting due to climate change. However, forecasting future health consequences of higher temperatures in a given city is complicated by uncertainties in how populations and societal infrastructure will adapt. This paper reviews approaches to address these challenges, including: (1) using historical weather-mortality relationships for the same region, or a location with a similar climate as the city of interest; (2) evaluating adaptation using the minimum mortality threshold (MMT) temperature (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate); and (3) estimating the impact of modifiers (e.g., air conditioning, population density, green space) on the temperature and mortality relation, and then predicting a range of effects based on plausible estimates for the future values of these parameters in a given city. Each approach can provide insight into how heat could affect mortality under a changing climate, but all have uncertainties. In spite of these limitations, projecting the future public health burden of temperature-related health effects can provide valuable information to aid public health and environmental authorities in planning and communicating the risks of climate change to the public. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Several investigators have documented the effect of temperature on mortality, although fewer have studied its impact on morbidity. In addition, little is known about the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as use of air conditioners (ACs). The authors investigated the association between temperature and hospital admissions in California from 1999 to 2005. They also determined whether AC ownership and usage, assessed at the zip-code level, mitigated this association. Because of the unique spatial pattern of income and climate in California, confounding of AC effects by other local factors is less likely. The authors included only persons who had a temperature monitor within 25 km of their residential zip code. Using a time-stratified case-crossover approach, the authors observed a significantly increased risk of hospitalization for multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, respiratory disease, pneumonia, dehydration, heat stroke, diabetes, and acute renal failure, with a 10°F increase in same-day apparent temperature. They also found that ownership and usage of ACs significantly reduced the effects of temperature on these health outcomes, after controlling for potential confounding by family income and other socioeconomic factors. These results demonstrate important effects of temperature on public health and the potential for mitigation. © The Author 2010.},

   abstract = {The scientific literature through 2005 on the effects of ventilation rates on health in indoor environments has been reviewed by a multidisciplinary group. The group judged 27 papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals as providing sufficient information on both ventilation rates and health effects to inform the relationship. Consistency was found across multiple investigations and different epidemiologic designs for different populations. Multiple health endpoints show similar relationships with ventilation rate. There is biological plausibility for an association of health outcomes with ventilation rates, although the literature does not provide clear evidence on particular agent(s) for the effects. Higher ventilation rates in offices, up to about 25l/s per person, are associated with reduced prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms. The limited available data suggest that inflammation, respiratory infections, asthma symptoms and short-term sick leave increase with lower ventilation rates. Home ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes per hour (h-1) have been associated with a reduced risk of allergic manifestations among children in a Nordic climate. The need remains for more studies of the relationship between ventilation rates and health, especially in diverse climates, in locations with polluted outdoor air and in buildings other than offices. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

   abstract = {Background: To assess the public health risk of heat waves and to set criteria for alerts for excessive heat, various meteorologic metrics and models are used in different jurisdictions, generally without systematic comparisons of alternatives. We report such an analysis for New York City that compared maximum heat index with alternative metrics in models to predict daily variation in warm-season natural-cause mortality from 1997 through 2006. Materials and methods: We used Poisson time-series generalized linear models and generalized additive models to estimate weather-mortality relationships using various metrics, lag and averaging times, and functional forms and compared model fit. Results: A model that included cubic functions of maximum heat index on the same and each of the previous 3 days provided the best fit, better than models using maximum, minimum, or average temperature, or spatial synoptic classification (SSC) of weather type. We found that goodness of fit and maximum heat index-mortality functions were similar using parametric and nonparametric models. Same-day maximum heat index was linearly related to mortality risk across its range. The slopes at lags of 1, 2, and 3 days were flat across moderate values but increased sharply between maximum heat index of 95°F and 100°F (35-38°C). SSC or other meteorologic variables added to the maximum heat index model moderately improved goodness of fit, with slightly attenuated maximum heat index-mortality functions. Conclusions: In New York City, maximum heat index performed similarly to alternative and more complex metrics in estimating mortality risk during hot weather. The linear relationship supports issuing heat alerts in New York City when the heat index is forecast to exceed approximately 95-100°F. Periodic city-specific analyses using recent data are recommended to evaluate public health risks from extreme heat.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 has caused a sizeable global outbreak and has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern. Sufficient evidence shows that temperature has an essential link with respiratory infectious diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the exposure-response relationship between ambient temperature, including extreme temperatures, and mortality of COVID-19. Methods: The Poisson distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was constructed to evaluate the non-linear delayed effects of ambient temperature on death, by using the daily new death of COVID-19 and ambient temperature data from January 10 to March 31, 2020, in Wuhan, China. Results: During the period mentioned above, the average daily number of COVID-19 deaths was approximately 45.2. Poisson distributed lag non-linear model showed that there was a non-linear relationship (U-shape) between the effect of ambient temperature and mortality. With confounding factors controlled, the daily cumulative relative death risk decreased by 12.3% (95% CI [3.4, 20.4%]) for every 1.0 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, the delayed effects of the low temperature are acute and short-term, with the most considerable risk occurring in 5–7 days of exposure. The delayed effects of the high temperature appeared quickly, then decrease rapidly, and increased sharply 15 days of exposure, mainly manifested as acute and long-term effects. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated that the results were robust. Conclusions: The relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 mortality was non-linear. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of death and temperature. Additionally, exposure to high and low temperatures had divergent impacts on mortality.},

   abstract = {The newly prevailing dockless bike-sharing system offers a decent solution to the first- and last-mile problem and connects trip origins/destinations and transit (mostly metro) stations. Few studies, however, have explored the effects of built environment characteristics on the integrated usage of dockless bike-sharing and the metro, especially in different conditions (e.g., access versus egress and morning peak versus evening peak) and using panel data. To fill the gap, this study proposes a people–metro–bike–route–urban space framework to describe the feeder-related built environment from the perspective of the feeder process. Using 3-day data of ofo bikes in Shenzhen, China, this study then develops multilevel negative binomial models that incorporate random effects and address the intracluster correlation attributed to repeated measures to scrutinize the feeder-related built environment effects on the integrated usage. The findings are listed as follows: (1) The majority of access and egress integrated trips have a distance range of 500–2000 m and a duration range of 2.5–10 min; (2) Popular metro stations (with a large ridership) are positively related to the access integrated usage; (3) The number of available shared bikes and the length of bikeway in the catchment areas of the metro are positively related to the integrated usage; and (4) Mixed land use increases the integrated usage, whereas urban villages are places with few demands for the integrated usage. These findings are beneficial in developing a bike-friendly built environment that facilitates the seamless connection between dockless bike-sharing and the metro.},

Data were drawn from a historical inventory of major development projects and crowdsourced citizen complaints data (311 calls) in Vancouver, Canada from 2011 to 2016. Mixed effects models were developed with an interaction between construction activities and after-hours report. Results show that neighborhood noise complaints were significantly associated with major constructions (IRR = 1.062, 95% CI = 1.024–1.097). A significant interaction effect was also found between construction activities and after-hours reporting (IRR = 1.050 CI = 1.012–1.087). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically show the adverse effects of urban development on noise annoyance. The results imply that existing noise bylaws may not be effective in restricting construction activities at night and during sleeping hours, which may cause adverse health effects.</p>},

   abstract = {Monthly or annual 5 km × 5 km gridded datasets covering the UK are generated for the 1961-2000 period, for 36 climatic parameters. As well as the usual elements of temperature, rainfall, sunshine, cloud, wind speed, and pressure, derived temperature variables (such as growing-season length, heating degree days, and heat and cold wave durations) and further precipitation variables (such as rainfall intensity, maximum consecutive dry days, and days of snow, hail and thunder) are analysed. The analysis process uses geographical information system capabilities to combine multiple regression with inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. Geographic and topographic factors, such as easting and northing, terrain height and shape, and urban and coastal effects, are incorporated either through normalization with regard to the 1961-90 average climate, or as independent variables in the regression. Local variations are then incorporated through the spatial interpolation of regression residuals. For each of the climatic parameters, the choice of model is based on verification statistics produced by excluding a random set of stations from the analysis for a selection of months, and comparing the observed values with the estimated values at each point. This gives some insight into the significance, direction, and seasonality of factors affecting different climate elements. It also gives a measure of the accuracy of the method at predicting values between station locations. The datasets are being used for the verification of climate modelling scenarios and are available via the Internet. © Crown Copyright 2005.

Surface and wind profiler observations are used to evaluate the performance of WRF-UCM. The model captures the observed nocturnal urban-heat-island intensity, diurnal rotation of surface winds, and the timing and vertical extent of sea breeze and its reversal in the boundary layer remarkably well. Using hourly SST slightly improves the WRF simulation of offshore wind and temperature. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate a delicate balance between the strength of sea breeze and prevailing offshore weak flow in determining the duration of the afternoon-evening stagnation in HG. When the morning offshore flow is weak (3-5 m s<sup>-1</sup>), variations (1-3C) in surface temperature caused by environmental conditions substantially modify the wind fields over HG. The existence of the city itself seems to favor stagnation. Extremely dry soils increase daytime surface temperature by about 2C, produced more vigorous boundary layer and faster moving sea breeze, favoring stagnation during late afternoon. The simulation with dry soils produces a 3 h shorter duration stagnation in the afternoon and 4 h longer duration in the evening, which may lead to more severe nighttime air pollution. Hourly variations of SST in shallow water in the Galveston Bay substantially affect the low-level wind speed in HG. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Verification statistics are calculated by interpolating model forecasts to the observation sites. The horizontal and vertical distributions of model errors are presented as are the diurnal and intraseasonal trends. During the cool season, both the MM5 and Eta have a low-level cool and moist bias over land, a significant surface warm bias over water, and surface winds that are too strong over land to the east of the Rockies and too weak over water. The low-level cool and moist bias is maximized during the day, and the cool bias is largest during late winter. During the warm season, the MM5 and Eta have little temperature bias over water and a negative wind speed bias over the Rockies. Both the MM5 and Eta have a surface dry and warm bias over land during the warm season; however, the Eta warm-season biases were reduced between 2000 and 2001 because of recent improvements to the land surface model and soil moisture initialization. Using the NCEP Aviation Model rather than the Eta to initialize the MM5 during the 2000/01 cool season resulted in slightly better sea level pressure forecasts over the Northeast on average, but not for wind temperature. In order to quantify the impact of increased resolution, the MM5 was verified down to 4-km grid spacing around coastal southern New England. For 32 objectively identified sea-breeze events, the 12-km MM5 has significantly greater wind and temperature skill along the coast than the 36-km version, but there is little improvement from 12 to 4 km. The sea breezes in the MM5 are too early on average and are associated with a late afternoon cool bias. Many of the MM5 and Eta errors have slowly evolving intraseasonal trends. In particular, the cool bias amplifies during the winter and the summer dry bias in the MM5 increases during prolonged wet periods. The sea level pressure errors are episodic, with clusters of negative and positive mean errors lasting approximately 3-6 weeks, thereby suggesting a dependence on the large-scale flow.},

   abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) have a significant and negative impact on the urban ecological environment and on human health, and it is imperative to examine factors that lead to UHIs. Although numerous studies have been conducted in this field, little research has considered seasonal variations in UHIs in coastal cities. Moreover, parametric statistical analyses, such as regression and correlation analyses, have been typically applied to examine the influential factors. Such analyses are flawed because they cannot uncover the complicated relationships between UHIs and their factors. Taking Dalian, a coastal city in China, as an example, this paper reveals the dynamic mechanism of the UHI effect for different seasons using the cubist regression tree algorithm. Analyses suggest that the UHI effect only exists in spring and summer, and no obvious UHIs can be found in autumn and winter. The adjacency to the sea leads to moderate UHI effects in spring and summer and no UHI or urban cooling island (UCI) effects in autumn and winter. The distance to the coastline, however, does not play a role in the UHI effect. Furthermore, as one of the most important factors, the vegetation coverage plays a significant role in the UHI effect in spring and summer and significantly mediates the UHI in autumn and winter. Comparatively, the elevation (e.g., digital elevation models (DEMs)) is consistently negatively associated with the land surface temperature in all seasons, although a stronger relationship was found in spring and summer. In addition, the surface slope is also a significant factor in spring and winter, and the population density impacts the UHI distribution in summer as well.},

The influence of these mesoscale atmospheric events on the ocean, particularly deep ocean convection, is not yet well understood. Because obtaining observations is difficult in this region, model simulations are essential for understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean during these wind events. This paper presents results from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulations run at four different resolutions (100, 50, 25, and 10 km) and forced with the ECMWF Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) product. Case study comparisons between WRF output at different resolutions, observations from the Greenland Flow Distortion Experiment (GFDex), which provides valuable in situ observations of mesoscale winds, and Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite data highlight the importance of high-resolution simulations for properly capturing the structure and high wind speeds associated with mesoscale wind events and surface fluxes of latent and sensible heat. In addition, the longer-term impact of mesoscale winds on the ocean is investigated by comparison of surface fluxes and winds between model resolutions over a two-month period. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {Human exposure to healthy doses of UV radiation is required for vitamin D synthesis, but exposure to excessive UV irradiance leads to several harmful impacts ranging from premature wrinkles to dangerous skin cancer. However, for countries located in the global dust belt, accurate estimation of the UV irradiance is challenging due to a strong impact of desert dust on incoming solar radiation. In this work, a UV Index forecasting capability is presented, specifically developed for dust-rich environments, that combines the use of ground-based measurements of broadband irradiances UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-315 nm), NASA OMI Aura satellite-retrieved data and the meteorology-chemistry mesoscale model WRF-Chem. The forecasting ability of the model is evaluated for clear sky days as well as during the influence of dust storms in Doha, Qatar. The contribution of UV radiation to the total incoming global horizontal irradiance (GHI) ranges between 5% and 7% for UVA and 0.1% and 0.22% for UVB. The UVI forecasting performance of the model is quite encouraging with an absolute average error of less than 6% and a correlation coefficient of 0.93. In agreement with observations, the model predicts that the UV Index at local noontime can drop from 10-11 on clear sky days to approximately 6-7 during typical dusty conditions in the Arabian Peninsula-an effect similar to the presence of extensive cloud cover.},

In order to investigate the change trends of precipitation, temperature and wind speed for effectively realizing the restoration and protection of desert ecosystems, a combination forecasting strategy including the data pre-processing technique, sub-models selection and parameter optimization was proposed and three numerical simulation experiments based on the combination model with the weights optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm were designed to forecast the precipitation, temperature and wind speed in the southeastern margin of the Tengger Desert in China. Numerical results showed that the proposed combination prediction method has higher forecasting accuracy and better robustness than single neural network models and hybrid models. The proposed method is beneficial to analyze climate change in arid regions.},

The main goal of the analysis is to identify the impacts of stay home living patterns on energy consumption of residential buildings. Specifically, metered data collected from various reported sources are reviewed and analyzed to assess the changes in overall electricity demand for various countries and US states. Weather adjusted time series data of electricity demand before and after COVID-19 lockdowns are used to determine the magnitude of changes in electricity demand and residential energy use patterns. The analysis results indicate that while overall electricity demand is lower because of lockdowns that impact commercial buildings and manufacturing sectors, the energy consumption for the housing sector has increased by as much as 30% during the full 2020 lockdown period. Analysis of reported end-use data indicates that most of the increase in household energy demand is due to higher occupancy patterns during daytime hours, resulting in increased use of energy intensive systems such as heating, air conditioning, lighting, and appliances. Several energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions are presented to cost-effectively mitigate the increase in energy demands due to extended stayhome living patterns.},

   abstract = {In urban areas, dense atmospheric observational networks with high-quality data are still a challenge due to high costs for installation and maintenance over time. Citizen weather stations (CWS) could be one answer to that issue. Since more and more owners of CWS share their measurement data publicly, crowdsourcing, i.e., the automated collection of large amounts of data from an undefined crowd of citizens, opens new pathways for atmospheric research. However, the most critical issue is found to be the quality of data from such networks. In this study, a statistically-based quality control (QC) is developed to identify suspicious air temperature (T) measurements from crowdsourced data sets. The newly developed QC exploits the combined knowledge of the dense network of CWS to statistically identify implausible measurements, independent of external reference data. The evaluation of the QC is performed using data from Netatmo CWS in Toulouse, France, and Berlin, Germany, over a 1-year period (July 2016 to June 2017), comparing the quality-controlled data with data from two networks of reference stations. The new QC efficiently identifies erroneous data due to solar exposition and siting issues, which are common error sources of CWS. Estimation of T is improved when averaging data from a group of stations within a restricted area rather than relying on data of individual CWS. However, a positive deviation in CWS data compared to reference data is identified, particularly for daily minimum T. To illustrate the transferability of the newly developed QC and the applicability of CWS data, a mapping of T is performed over the city of Paris, France, where spatial density of CWS is especially high.},

Heat waves, generally understood to be acute periods of extreme warmth, are relevant to a wide range of stakeholders because of the impacts that these events have on human health and activities and on natural environments. Perhaps because of the diversity of communities engaged in heat wave monitoring and research, there is no single, standard definition of a heat wave. Experts differ in which threshold values (absolute versus relative), duration and ancillary variables to incorporate into heat wave definitions. While there is value in this diversity of perspectives, the lack of a unified index can cause confusion when discussing patterns, trends, and impacts. Here, we use data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System to examine patterns and trends in 15 previously published heat wave indices for the period 1979-2011 across the Continental United States. Over this period the Southeast region saw the highest number of heat wave days for the majority of indices considered. Positive trends (increases in number of heat wave days per year) were greatest in the Southeast and Great Plains regions, where more than 12 % of the land area experienced significant increases in the number of heat wave days per year for the majority of heat wave indices. Significant negative trends were relatively rare, but were found in portions of the Southwest, Northwest, and Great Plains.},

   abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a spatial statistical technique that recognizes that traditional ‘global’ regression models may be limited when spatial processes vary with spatial context. GWR captures process spatial heterogeneity by allowing effects to vary over space. To do this, GWR calibrates an ensemble of local linear models at any number of locations using ‘borrowed’ nearby data. This provides a surface of location-specific parameter estimates for each relationship in the model that is allowed to vary spatially, as well as a single bandwidth parameter that provides intuition about the geographic scale of the processes. A recent extension to this framework allows each relationship to vary according to a distinct spatial scale parameter, and is therefore known as multiscale (M)GWR. This paper introduces mgwr, a Python-based implementation of MGWR that explicitly focuses on the multiscale analysis of spatial heterogeneity. It provides novel functionality for inference and exploratory analysis of local spatial processes, new diagnostics unique to multi-scale local models, and drastic improvements to efficiency in estimation routines. We provide two case studies using mgwr, in addition to reviewing core concepts of local models. We present this in a literate programming style, providing an overview of the primary software functionality and demonstrations of suggested usage alongside the discussion of primary concepts and demonstration of the improvements made in mgwr.},

Thirteen percent of the population did not possess an air conditioner (AC), and another 15% used AC never/infrequently. In adjusted models, odds of not possessing AC were greater for non-Hispanic blacks compared with other races/ethnicities, odds ratio (OR) = 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.5), and for those with low annual household income, OR = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.8, 5.5). Only 12% reported going to a public place with AC if they could not keep cool at home. While low-income individuals were less likely to be aware of heat warnings, they were more likely to be concerned that heat could make them ill and that climate change would affect their health than participants with a higher household income, OR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.3). In NYC, lack of access to AC partially explains disparities in heat-related health outcomes. Our results point to opportunities for knowledge building and engagement on heat-health awareness and climate change adaptation that can be applied in NYC and other metropolitan areas to improve and target public health prevention efforts.},

Methods presented to account for spatial autocorrelation are based on the two fundamentally different approaches of generalised estimating equations as well as waveletrevised methods. Both methods are extensions to generalised linear models. spind also provides functions for multi-model inference and scaling by wavelet multiresolution regression.

   abstract = {Background: There have been large-scale outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Mainland China over the last decade. These events varied greatly across the country. It is necessary to identify the spatial risk factors and spatial distribution patterns of HFMD for public health control and prevention. Climate risk factors associated with HFMD occurrence have been recognized. However, few studies discussed the socio-economic determinants of HFMD risk at a space scale. Methods. HFMD records in Mainland China in May 2008 were collected. Both climate and socio-economic factors were selected as potential risk exposures of HFMD. Odds ratio (OR) was used to identify the spatial risk factors. A spatial autologistic regression model was employed to get OR values of each exposures and model the spatial distribution patterns of HFMD risk. Results: Results showed that both climate and socio-economic variables were spatial risk factors for HFMD transmission in Mainland China. The statistically significant risk factors are monthly average precipitation (OR = 1.4354), monthly average temperature (OR = 1.379), monthly average wind speed (OR = 1.186), the number of industrial enterprises above designated size (OR = 17.699), the population density (OR = 1.953), and the proportion of student population (OR = 1.286). The spatial autologistic regression model has a good goodness of fit (ROC = 0.817) and prediction accuracy (Correct ratio = 78.45%) of HFMD occurrence. The autologistic regression model also reduces the contribution of the residual term in the ordinary logistic regression model significantly, from 17.25 to 1.25 for the odds ratio. Based on the prediction results of the spatial model, we obtained a map of the probability of HFMD occurrence that shows the spatial distribution pattern and local epidemic risk over Mainland China. Conclusions: The autologistic regression model was used to identify spatial risk factors and model spatial risk patterns of HFMD. HFMD occurrences were found to be spatially heterogeneous over the Mainland China, which is related to both the climate and socio-economic variables. The combination of socio-economic and climate exposures can explain the HFMD occurrences more comprehensively and objectively than those with only climate exposures. The modeled probability of HFMD occurrence at the county level reveals not only the spatial trends, but also the local details of epidemic risk, even in the regions where there were no HFMD case records. © 2014 Bo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {This work investigates whether and how COVID-19 containment policies had an immediate impact on crime trends in Los Angeles. The analysis is conducted using Bayesian structural time-series and focuses on nine crime categories and on the overall crime count, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. We concentrate on two post-intervention time windows—from March 4th to March 16th and from March 4th to March 28th 2020—to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and strict policies. In Los Angeles, overall crime has significantly decreased, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft, and battery. No significant effect has been detected for vehicle theft, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, intimate partner assault, and homicide. Results suggest that, in the first weeks after the interventions are put in place, social distancing impacts more directly on instrumental and less serious crimes. Policy implications are also discussed.},

   abstract = {Data from 25 large U.S. cities is assembled to estimate the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime. There is a widespread immediate drop in both criminal incidents and arrests most heavily pronounced among drug crimes, theft, residential burglaries, and most violent crimes. The decline appears to precede stay-at-home orders, and arrests follow a similar pattern as reports. There is no decline in homicides and shootings, and an increase in non-residential burglary and car theft in most cities, suggesting that criminal activity was displaced to locations with fewer people. Pittsburgh, New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington DC and Chicago each saw overall crime drops of at least 35%. Evidence from police-initiated reports and geographic variation in crime change suggests that most of the observed changes are not due to changes in crime reporting.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders. This article used police-recorded open crime data to understand how the frequency of common types of crime changed in 16 large cities across the United States in the early months of 2020. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of crime in previous years were used to forecast the expected frequency of crime in 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In some cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary. Thefts of motor vehicles decreased in some cities while there were diverging patterns of thefts from motor vehicles. These results are used to make suggestions for future research into the relationships between the coronavirus pandemic and different crimes.},

   abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state-level governments across the United States issued mandatory stay-at-home orders around the end of March 2020. Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This study's purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime-as measured by calls for service to law enforcement-has decreased markedly. However, there are multiple indications that the crime drop is being driven by decreases in minor offenses which are typically committed in peer groups. At the same time, serious crimes which are generally not committed with co-offenders (namely homicide and intimate partner violence) have either remained constant or increased. As such, the crime drop appears to be hiding a very disturbing trend where homicides remain unchanged and intimate partner batteries are increasing. Since many offenders would presumably be committing less serious crimes in a non-pandemic world, we raise attention to the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have taken minor offenders and placed them into situations where there is rampant opportunity for intimate partner violence, serious batteries, and homicides. While crime in the U.S. appears to be down overall, this good news should not blind us to a troubling co-occurring reality-a reality that paints a dim picture of unintended consequences to public health and criminal justice finances as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns.},

However, those declines depend on crime type and may differ by parts of a city and land uses. This paper examines burglary in Detroit, Michigan during the month of March, 2020, a period of considerable change in routine activities. We examine 879 block groups, separating those dominated by residential land use from those with more mixed land use. We divide the month into three periods: pre-containment, transition period, and post-containment. Burglaries increase in block groups with mixed land use, but not blocks dominated by residential land use. The impact of containment policies on burglary clarifies after taking land use into account.},

   abstract = {The covid-19 disease has a large impact on life across the globe, and this could potentially include impacts on crime. The present study describes how crime has changed in Sweden during ten weeks after the government started to implement interventions to reduce spread of the disease. Sweden has undertaken smaller interventions than many other countries and is therefore a particularly interesting case to study. The first major interventions in Sweden were implemented in the end of week 11 (March 12th) in the year 2020, and we analyze police reported crimes through week 21 (ending May 24th). Descriptive statistics are provided relative to expected levels with 95% confidence intervals for eight crime types. We find that total crime, assaults, pickpocketing and burglary have decreased significantly, personal robberies and narcotics crime are unchanged. Vandalism possibly increased somewhat but is hard to draw any firm conclusions on. The reductions are fairly small for most crime types, in the 5-20% range, with pickpocketing being the biggest exception noting a 59% drop relative to expected levels.},

   abstract = {Governments around the world restricted movement of people, using social distancing and lockdowns, to help stem the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We examine crime effects for one UK police force area in comparison to 5-year averages. There is variation in the onset of change by crime type, some declining from the WHO 'global pandemic' announcement of 11 March, others later. By 1 week after the 23 March lockdown, all recorded crime had declined 41%, with variation: shoplifting (− 62%), theft (− 52%), domestic abuse (− 45%), theft from vehicle (− 43%), assault (− 36%), burglary dwelling (− 25%) and burglary non-dwelling (− 25%). We use Google Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports to calculate the mobility elasticity of crime for four crime types, finding shoplifting and other theft inelastic but responsive to reduced retail sector mobility (MEC = 0.84, 0.71 respectively), burglary dwelling elastic to increases in residential area mobility (− 1), with assault inelastic but responsive to reduced workplace mobility (0.56). We theorise that crime rate changes were primarily caused by those in mobility, suggesting a mobility theory of crime change in the pandemic. We identify implications for crime theory, policy and future research.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted the world in ways not seen in generations. Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based. The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed, but also how to influence future crime reduction. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 is unquestionably one of the most significant worldwide events in recent history, impacting culture, government operations, crime, economics , politics, and social interactions for the foreseeable future. One unique aspect of this crisis is the governmental response of issuing legal stay-at-home orders to attempt to slow the spread of the virus. While these orders varied, both in degree and timing, between countries and states, they generally began with strong encouragement for persons to isolate themselves voluntarily.

   abstract = {<p>Deadly heat waves are increasing with climate change. Public forecasts and warnings are a primary public health strategy for dealing with such extreme weather events; however, temperatures can vary widely within the administrative units used to issue warnings, particularly across urban landscapes. The emergence of more frequent and widely distributed sources of urban temperature data provide the opportunity to investigate the specificity of the current National Weather Service (NWS) warnings and to improve their accuracy and precision. In this work, temperatures from distributed public weather stations, NWS heat advisories and warnings, and land surface temperature imagery throughout two large metropolitan areas, Atlanta and Chicago, during the 2006–2012 summers are considered. We investigate the spatial variability of hazardous temperatures and their agreement against NWS advisories. Second, we examine the potential for thermal imagery to replicate National Weather Service heat warnings. Observations from weather stations exhibit varying degrees of agreement with NWS advisories. The level of agreement varied by station and was not found to be associated with the station’s proximate land cover. Air temperatures estimated from satellite imagery correspond with NWS Advisory status regionally and may enable creating more refined public warnings regarding hazardous temperatures and protective actions</p>},

   abstract = {<p>U.S. government officials are focusing their attention on how to deliver timely and effective warning information to the public, especially given the devastating weather-related events that have occurred in recent years. With the increase of cell phones (and in particular, web-capable smartphones), weather warnings sent through various cellular technologies represent one way for officials to quickly notify an increasingly mobile public. Cellular technology innovations also make it possible for officials to broadcast information-rich media like graphics to cell phones. Whether warning messages must include such “rich” media to be effective remains an open question. The current study investigates the effectiveness of National Weather Service (NWS) warning messages sent either in plain text or in text that includes a radar image of the storm. The research protocol was modeled after the interactive National Weather Service (iNWS) messaging service currently available to NWS core partners. In the study, participants read full-text NWS warnings of tornadoes or flash floods that either did or did not include a radar image of the storm. The researchers timed participants' ability to decide if a critical town was in the warning area, and then probed their understanding of the message content. Results show that participants' decision times to the town question did not differ between the graphic and no-graphic conditions. None of the other message content measures differed as a function of message condition. The results have potential implications for the federal government's new Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system, which, as yet, is limited to text-only warnings.</p>},

The measures include instructions that individuals maintain social distance when in public, school closures, limitations on gatherings and business operations, and instructions to remain at home. Social distancing may have an impact on the volume and distribution of crime. Crimes such as residential burglary may decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property. Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact between potential offenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to deal with the evolving crisis. Understanding how social distancing policies impact crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health measures. Examination of the most recently available data from both Los Angeles, CA, and Indianapolis, IN, shows that social distancing has had a statistically significant impact on a few specific crime types. However, the overall effect is notably less than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic life.},

   abstract = {Deadly heat waves are increasing with climate change. Public forecasts and warnings are a primary public health strategy for dealing with such extreme weather events; however, temperatures can vary widely within the administrative units used to issue warnings, particularly across urban landscapes. The emergence of more frequent and widely distributed sources of urban temperature data provide the opportunity to investigate the specificity of the current National Weather Service (NWS) warnings and to improve their accuracy and precision. In this work, temperatures from distributed public weather stations, NWS heat advisories and warnings, and land surface temperature imagery throughout two large metropolitan areas, Atlanta and Chicago, during the 2006-2012 summers are considered. We investigate the spatial variability of hazardous temperatures and their agreement against NWS advisories. Second, we examine the potential for thermal imagery to replicate National Weather Service heat warnings. Observations from weather stations exhibit varying degrees of agreement with NWS advisories. The level of agreement varied by station and was not found to be associated with the station's proximate land cover. Air temperatures estimated from satellite imagery correspond with NWS Advisory status regionally and may enable creating more refined public warnings regarding hazardous temperatures and protective actions.},

   abstract = {One approach to delaying the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is to reduce human travel by imposing travel restriction policies. Understanding the actual human mobility response to such policies remains a challenge owing to the lack of an observed and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during the pandemic. This study uses an integrated dataset, consisting of anonymized and privacy-protected location data from over 150 million monthly active samples in the USA, COVID-19 case data and census population information, to uncover mobility changes during COVID-19 and under the stay-at-home state orders in the USA. The study successfully quantifies human mobility responses with three important metrics: daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles travelled; and daily percentage of residents staying at home. The data analytics reveal a spontaneous mobility reduction that occurred regardless of government actions and a 'floor' phenomenon, where human mobility reached a lower bound and stopped decreasing soon after each state announced the stay-at-home order. A set of longitudinal models is then developed and confirms that the states' stay-at-home policies have only led to about a 5% reduction in average daily human mobility. Lessons learned from the data analytics and longitudinal models offer valuable insights for government actions in preparation for another COVID-19 surge or another virus outbreak in the future.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE This paper describes the spatial pattern of New York City (NYC) heat-related emergency medical services (EMS) ambulance dispatches and emergency department visits (ED) and explores how this information can be used in planning for and response to heat-related health events. BACKGROUND During heat waves the New York City Department of Health and the Office of Emergency Management utilize the Heat Emergency Plan that includes responses such as the opening of cooling centers and targeted messaging to vulnerable populations. In 2006, New York City experienced a severe 10-day heat wave during which 46 people died of heat stroke. However, the number of people who died of other causes due to the heat and the overall burden of heat-related illness was not known. Subsequently, a systematic retrospective analysis was conducted to determine how vital statistics and syndromic surveillance data might best be used in planning for future heat events. Temporal analyses were improved by the inclusion of meteorological variables in a model of expected visits allowing for the identification of heat waves with particularly severe health response. The analyses also suggested that severe heat waves might be identified early. It was hypothesized that spatial signals may identify areas of the city that have persistent increases in illness during these events. METHODS Daily EMS ambulance dispatch call data are transmitted electronically from the NYC Fire Department to DOHMH and include all medical 911 calls coded into 52 broad call-types. ED data come from 48 of 62 NYC hospitals covering 90% of total ED visits and including chief complaints. We use data from May to September, 1999-2006 in this study. Daily temperature data were obtained from the National Weather Services. We defined heat waves as any period that has maximum daily temperature >= 90 °F for three days or more. The Heat Call Odds were calculated use heat/total calls rate on heat wave days divided by the rate on the non-heat wave days. Spatial analysis is performed using SatScan with all non-heat wave days as baseline control and all heat wave days as cases. We developed two models using Poisson regression (one controlling for temporal trends only, the other controlling for temporal trends and meteorologic factors).},

   abstract = {Street trees are often unequally distributed in urban areas, and their physical and structural attributes, such as extent of canopy cover, species composition, and size distribution, are also spatially heterogeneous. Some studies report that inequalities are more prevalent in streetscapes than in private landscapes. Considering the existing inequality issues and public nature of street trees, street tree inequality studies warrant greater attention. However, most existing studies in this field focus heavily on the unequal distribution of tree canopy cover, while disregarding other tree attributes. In this study, seven street tree measures covering tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure were derived from high-resolution satellite images, Google Street View, and street tree census. We then applied the geographically weighted regression to these seven tree measures in New York City, United States, compared street tree inequalities among different socioeconomic groups, and identified inequality hotspots. Our results show that street tree inequalities are greatest with respect to tree abundance and species diversity. Furthermore, race-based and education-based inequalities are most notable, and age-, income-, and household characteristic-based inequalities were also detected based on tree abundance or species diversity. Socially vulnerable areas that suffer the most severe inequalities are clustered in Brooklyn and Queens. Disaggregated street tree inequalities, with explicit recognition of the differentiated distribution of limited tree resources among different social groups and across geographical areas, are critical for effective decision-making to alleviate environmental inequities.},

   abstract = {Access to air conditioned space is critical for protecting urban populations from the adverse effects of heat exposure. Yet there remains fairly limited knowledge of the penetration of private (home air conditioning) and distribution of public (cooling centers and commercial space) cooled space across cities. Furthermore, the deployment of government-sponsored cooling centers is likely to be inadequately informed with respect to the location of existing cooling resources (residential air conditioning and air conditioned public space), raising questions of the equitability of access to heat refuges. We explore the distribution of private and public cooling resources and access inequities at the household level in two major US urban areas: Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (whose county seat is Phoenix). We evaluate the presence of in-home air conditioning and develop a walking-based accessibility measure to air conditioned public space using a combined cumulative opportunities-gravity approach. We find significant variations in the distribution of residential air conditioning across both regions which are largely attributable to building age and inter/intra-regional climate differences. There are also regional disparities in walkable access to public cooled space. At average walking speeds, we find that official cooling centers are only accessible to a small fraction of households (3% in Los Angeles, 2% in Maricopa) while a significantly higher number of households (80% in Los Angeles, 39% in Maricopa) have access to at least one other type of public cooling resource such as a library or commercial establishment. Aggregated to a neighborhood level, we find that there are areas within each region where access to cooled space (either public or private) is limited which may increase heat-related health risks.},

   abstract = {Extreme heat is a major public health concern in the United States. Temperatures are increasing across the country, with more frequent and severe heat waves in many regions. This trend is projected to continue. Exposure to heat may increase the risk of illness particularly among sensitive groups such as people who do not have access to air conditioning, older adults, young children, people working outdoors, athletes, the socially isolated, people with existing chronic conditions, and some communities of color. Health departments, their partners, and other government agencies have undertaken a variety of strategies to protect the public from high temperatures. One potential strategy is a heat response plan - a coordinated plan that describes and organizes activities to prevent heat-related morbidity and mortality in a community. Health departments at all levels (state, local, Tribal, and territorial) and their partners can develop and implement a response to protect their community and vulnerable populations. There is evidence that heat response plans can protect health, but mixed evidence on the effectiveness of individual components of a heat response plan and the degree of overall health protection. This document is intended to give a summary of extreme heat, the health burden of heat exposure, the impacts of climate change, and components and effectiveness of heat response plans with a focus on relevant peer-reviewed literature and existing heat response plans. Resources and examples of successful implementation and potential collaborative efforts are included. Introduction},

However, there are older people living within the community who have developed adaptive and resilient environments around their home that provide some protection during periods of extreme heat. This study investigated the housing stock and self-reported thermal comfort of a group of older people living in a regional town in Australia during the summer of 2012. The results indicated that daily maximum living room temperature was not significantly correlated with outdoor temperature, and daily minimum living room temperature was very weakly correlated with outdoor temperature. Residents reported feeling comfortable when indoor temperature approximated 26 °C. As living room temperature increased, indoor thermal comfort decreased. Significant differences between indoor temperatures were noted for homes that were related to house characteristics such as the age of the house, the number of air-conditioning units, the pitch of the roof, home insulation and the number of heat-mitigation modifications made to the home. Brick veneer homes showed smaller diurnal changes in temperature than other building materials. With population ageing and the increasing focus on older people living in the community, the quality of the housing stock available to them will influence their risk of heat exposure during extreme weather.},

   abstract = {The potential levels of exposure to indoor overheating in an urban environment are assessed for vulnerable social housing residents. Particular focus is given to the synergistic effects between summertime ventilation behaviour, indoor temperature and air pollutant concentration in relation to energy retrofit and climate change. Three different types of social housing are investigated (1900s' low-rise, 1950s' mid-rise and 1960s' high-rise). The case study dwellings are located in Central London and occupied by vulnerable individuals (elderly and/or people suffering from ill-health or mobility impairment). Indoor temperature monitoring suggests that occupants are already exposed to some degree of overheating; the highest levels of overheating occur in 1960s' high-rise tower blocks. The thermal and airflow performance simulation of a mid-floor flat in the 1960s' block under the current and projected future climate indicates that improved natural ventilation strategies may reduce overheating risk to a certain extent, with night cooling and shading being slightly more effective than all-day rapid ventilation. However, their potential may be limited in future due to high external temperatures and the undesired ingress of outdoor pollutants. This highlights the need for the development of combined strategies aiming to achieve both indoor thermal comfort and air quality.},

The identification of local patterns of spatial association is an important concern in this respect. In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations. 1995 The Ohio State University},

Much work in heat health has focused only on temperature-based metrics, which do not fully measure the physiological impact of heat stress on the human body. The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) consists of 139 sites across the United States and includes meteorological parameters that fully encompass human tolerance to heat, including relative humidity, wind, and solar radiation. Hourly and 5-min observations from USCRN are used to develop heat exposure products, including heat index (HI), apparent temperature (AT), and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Validation of this product is conducted with nearby airport and mesonet stations, with reanalysis data used to fill in data gaps. Using these derived heat products, two separate analyses are conducted. The first is based on standardized anomalies, which place current heat state in the context of a long-term climate record. In the second study, heat events are classified by time spent at various levels of severity of conditions. There is no consensus as to what defines a heat event, so a comparison of absolute thresholds (i.e., $30.08, 35.08, and 40.08C) and relative thresholds ($90th, 95th, and 98th percentile) will be examined. The efficacy of the product set will be studied using an extreme heat case study in the southeastern United States. While no heat exposure metric is deemed superior, each has their own advantages and caveats, especially in the context of public communication.},

Investment risk grades assigned >80 y ago through security maps from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) are associated with current sociodemographics and adverse health outcomes. We assessed whether historical HOLC investment grades are associated with 2010 greenspace, a health-promoting neighborhood resource. OBJECTIVES: We compared 2010 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) across previous HOLC neighborhood grades using propensity score restriction and matching. METHODS: Security map shapefiles were downloaded from the Mapping Inequality Project. Neighborhood investment risk grades included A (best, green), B (blue), C (yellow), and D (hazardous, red, i.e., redlined). We used 2010 satellite imagery to calculate the average NDVI for each HOLC neighborhood. Our main outcomes were 2010 annual average NDVI and summer NDVI. We assigned areal-apportioned 1940 census measures to each HOLC neighborhood. We used propensity score restriction, matching, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation to limit model extrapolation, reduce confounding, and estimate the association between HOLC grade and NDVI for the following comparisons: Grades B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C. RESULTS: Across 102 urban areas (4,141 HOLC polygons), annual average ± standard deviation (SD) 2010 NDVI was 0.47 (± 0:09), 0.43 (± 0:09), 0.39 (± 0:09), and 0.36 (± 0:10) in Grades A–D, respectively. In analyses adjusted for current ecoregion and census region, 1940s census measures, and 1940s population density, annual average NDVI values in 2010 were estimated at −0:039 (95% CI: −0:045, −0:034), −0:024 (95% CI: −0:030, −0:018), and −0:026 (95% CI: −0:037, −0:015) for Grades B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C, respectively, in the 1930s. DISCUSSION: Estimates adjusted for historical characteristics indicate that neighborhoods assigned worse HOLC grades in the 1930s are associated with reduced present-day greenspace. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7495.},

The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies. Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes. We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation, to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience to global environmental change.},

Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each of the three study cities. Takeaway for practice: By examining areas that have experienced sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.},

Indoor temperatures and determinants of indoor temperatures have rarely been studied on a large scale. We measured living room and bedroom temperature in 113 homes of elderly subjects, as well as outdoor temperatures, in two cities in the Netherlands. Linear regression was used to determine the influence of building characteristics on indoor living room and bedroom temperatures in the warm episode. During the warm episode, indoor temperatures were higher during the night and lower during the day than outdoor temperatures. Indoor temperatures on average exceeded outdoor temperatures. The weekly average indoor temperature in living rooms varied between 23.1 and 30.2 °C. Dwellings that warmed up easily, also cooled down more easily. Outdoor and indoor temperatures were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.36 and 0.34 for living rooms and bedrooms, respectively). Building year before 1930 and rooms being located on the top floor were associated with higher indoor temperatures. Green in the vicinity was associated with lower temperatures in bedrooms. This study shows that indoor temperatures vary widely between dwellings, and are determined by outdoor temperatures and building characteristics. As most people, especially the elderly, spend most of the time indoor, indoor temperature is a more exact predictor of heat exposure than outdoor temperature. The importance of mitigating high indoor temperatures will be more important in the future because of higher temperatures due to climate change.},

   abstract = {Heat exposure of a population is often estimated by applying temperatures from outdoor monitoring stations. However, this can lead to exposure misclassification if residents do not live close to the monitoring station and temperature varies over small spatial scales due to land use/built environment variability, or if residents generally spend more time indoors than outdoors. Here, we compare summertime temperatures measured inside 145 homes in low-income households in Baltimore city with temperatures from the National Weather Service weather station in Baltimore. There is a large variation in indoor temperatures, with daily-mean indoor temperatures varying from 10 °C lower to 10 °C higher than outdoor temperatures. Furthermore, there is only a weak association between the indoor and outdoor temperatures across all houses, indicating that the outdoor temperature is not a good predictor of the indoor temperature for the residences sampled. It is shown that much of the variation is due to differences in the availability of air conditioning (AC). Houses with central AC are generally cooler than outdoors (median difference of − 3.4 °C) while those with no AC are generally warmer (median difference of 1.4 °C). For the collection of houses with central or room AC, there is essentially no relationship between indoor and outdoor temperatures, but for the subset of houses with no AC, there is a weak relationship (correlation coefficient of 0.36). The results presented here suggest future epidemiological studies of indoor exposure to heat would benefit from information on the availability of AC within the population.},

   abstract = {Thermal comfort research has utilized various sensors and models to estimate the mean radiant temperature (MRT) experienced by a human, including the standard black globe thermometer (SGT), acrylic globe thermometers (AGT), and cylindrical radiation thermometers (CRT). Rather than directly measuring radiation, a temperature is measured in the center of these low-cost sensors that can be related to MRT after theoretically accounting for convection. However, these sensors have not been systematically tested under long-term hot and clear conditions. Further, under variable weather conditions, many issues can arise due to slow response times, shape, inaccuracies in material properties and assumptions, and color (albedo, emissivity) inconsistencies. Here, we assess the performance of MRT produced by various heat transfer models, with and without new average surface temperature (T¯ s) correction factors, using five instruments—the SGT (15 cm, black), tan and black CRTs, gray and black 38 mm AGTs—compared to 3D integral radiation measurements. Measurements were taken on an unobscured roof throughout summer-to-early-fall months in Tempe, Arizona, examining 58 full-sun days. Deviations without correcting for asymmetrical surface heating—found to be the main cause of errors—reached ± 15–20 °C MRT. By accounting for asymmetric heating through T¯ s calculations, new corrective algorithms were derived for the low-cost sensor models. Results show significant improvements in the estimated MRT error for each sensor (i.e., ∆MRTmodel − IRM) when applying the T¯ s corrections. The tan MRTCRT improved from 1.9 ± 6.2 to −0.1 ± 4.4 °C, while the gray AGT and SGT showed improvements from −1.6 ± 7.2 to −0.4 ± 6.3 °C and − 6.6 ± 6.4 to − 0.03 ± 5.7 °C, respectively. The new corrections also eliminated dependence on other meteorological factors (zenith, wind speed). From these results, we provide three simple equations for CRT, AGT, and SGT correction for future research use under warm-hot and clear conditions. This study is the most comprehensive empirical assessment of various low-cost instruments with broad applicability in urban climate and biometeorological research.},

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Abstract The spatial Durbin model occupies a key position in Spatial Econometrics. It is the reduced form of a model with cross-sectional dependence in the errors, but it may also be used as the nesting model in a more general approach of model selection. In the first case, it is the equation where we solve the Likelihood Ratio test of Common Factors, LRCOM. The objective in this case is to discriminate between substantive and residual dependence in an, apparently, misspecified equation. Our paper tries to go further into the interpretation of this intermediate equation in both aspects. We include a small Monte Carlo study related to the LRCOM test and present some new results that facilitate the use, and the interpretation, of the Durbin equation in a more general context of discriminating between econometric models in a spatial context.},

Leaders in this field, the authors clarify the often-mystifying phenomenon of simultaneous spatial dependence. By presenting new methods, they help with the interpretation of spatial regression models, especially ones that include spatial lags of the dependent variable. The authors also examine the relationship between spatiotemporal processes and long-run equilibrium states that are characterized by simultaneous spatial dependence. MATLAB® toolboxes useful for spatial econometric estimation are available on the authors' websites. This work covers spatial econometric modeling as well as numerous applied illustrations of the methods.

This study examined heat-related health inequalities within one city in order to understand the relationships between the microclimates of urban neighborhoods, population characteristics, thermal environments that regulate microclimates, and the resources people possess to cope with climatic conditions. A simulation model was used to estimate an outdoor human thermal comfort index (HTCI) as a function of local climate variables collected in 8 diverse city neighborhoods during the summer of 2003 in Phoenix, USA. HTCI is an indicator of heat stress, a condition that can cause illness and death. There were statistically significant differences in temperatures and HTCI between the neighborhoods during the entire summer, which increased during a heat wave period. Lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups were more likely to live in warmer neighborhoods with greater exposure to heat stress. High settlement density, sparse vegetation, and having no open space in the neighborhood were significantly correlated with higher temperatures and HTCI. People in warmer neighborhoods were more vulnerable to heat exposure because they had fewer social and material resources to cope with extreme heat. Urban heat island reduction policies should specifically target vulnerable residential areas and take into account equitable distribution and preservation of environmental resources.},

We begin by providing a baseline description of Florida's pre-1900 land cover, natural resource distribution, and biodiversity. This is followed by a description of major land use changes and trends related to transportation, agriculture, mining, urbanization, tourism, disruption of natural processes, and conservation from 1900 to the present. We also describe changes in land use and land cover caused by climate change. The chapter concludes with a discussion of current land use and land cover patterns, and the potential impacts of climate change and continued human population growth on the remaining natural and rural landscapes in Florida. Much has changed in Florida over the last century due to a combination of wetland draining, agriculture conversion, urban development, and establishment of several dominant exotic plant species, as well as accelerating sea level rise and shifting climate zones due to climate change. Key Messages • Land cover and land use within Florida have changed dramatically since pre-settlement times, primarily due to human activities, with significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. • Climate-related impacts on land cover, resulting from human-caused climate change, have also been documented in Florida. • Patterns of historic land use and land cover change are important to quantify and visualize so that we can assess the degree to which natural systems have been impacted and changed by human activities. • Florida still has highly significant cultural and natural landscapes, which provide important services to people, in addition to possessing intrinsic values separate from their value to humans. • As future changes continue to occur as a result of climate change and population growth, it will be more important than ever to conduct careful land use planning and management so that we can preserve natural and cultural resources, and maintain the qualities that make Florida the special place that it is today.},

The objective of this study was to identify area-level risk factors for heat-related illness (HRI) at the ZIP code level for urban and rural locations. We aggregated ZIP code-level emergency department visits into rural and urban locations based on population density. Area-level risk factors included previously established heat health risk factors (e.g. poverty, minority) and unexamined area-level risk factors common to rural locations (e.g. mobile homes, agriculture). Due to high spatial autocorrelation, a spatial error regression model was applied to identify risk factors with a significant relationship with HRI. Our results suggest that rural locations are also heat vulnerable, with greater rates of HRI compared to urban locations. Previously unexamined heat-health risk factors, including the number of mobile homes, non-citizens, and the labor-intensity of the agriculture, were all associated with increases of HRI in rural locations. In urban locations, previously established risk factors for heat-related mortality, such as decreased vegetation, living in poverty, and low education attainment were associated with increases in HRI.},

Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior. Methods: We used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. Results: At the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 % (95 % CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 %) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (>90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 % higher (β = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0-25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 %.

The interface between climate and tourism is multifaceted and complex, as climate represents both a vital resource to be exploited and an important limiting factor that poses risks to be managed by the tourism industry and tourists alike. All tourism destinations and operators are climate-sensitive to a degree and climate is a key influence on travel planning and the travel experience. This chapter provides a synopsis of the capacities and needs for climate services in the tourism sector, including current and emerging applications of climate services by diverse tourism end-users, and a discussion of key knowledge gaps, research and capacity-building needs and partnerships that are required to accelerate the application of climate information to manage risks to climate variability and facilitate successful adaptation to climate change. © 2010 Published by Elsevier.},

   abstract = {Context: Interscholastic heat policies for football have not been evidence based. Therefore, their effectiveness in mitigating exertional heat illness has not been assessed. Objective: To discuss the development of the Georgia High School Association heat policy and assess the effectiveness of revised guidelines. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Georgia high schools. Patients or Other Participants: Interscholastic football players in grades 9 through 12. Main Outcome Measure(s): Heat syncope and heat exhaustion (HS/HE) illness rates (IRs) were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), and relative risk (RR) was calculated as a ratio of postpolicy (POST) IR divided by prepolicy (PRE) IR. Results: A total of 214 HS/HE cases (172 PRE, 42 POST) and 341 348 AEs (178 230 PRE, 163 118 POST) were identified. During the first 5 days of the PRE period, approximately 50% of HS/HE illnesses occurred; HS/HE IRs doubled when practice sessions increased from 2 to 2.5 hours and tripled for practices ≥3 hours. The HS/HE IRs in the PRE period increased from 0.44/1000 AEs for wet-bulb globe temperatures (WBGTs) of,828F (,27.88C) to .2.0/1000 AEs for WBGTs from 878F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C). The RRs comparing PRE and POST policy periods were 0.29 for WBGTs of,82.08F (,27.808C), 0.65 for WBGTs from 82.08F (27.88C) to 86.98F (30.58C), and 0.23 for WBGTs from 87.08F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C). No HS/HE illnesses occurred in the POST period for WBGTs at .908F (.32.38C). Conclusions: Results from the PRE period guided the Georgia High School Association to revise its heat and humidity policy to include a mandated 5-day acclimatization period when no practices may exceed 2 hours and the use of WBGT-based activity-modification categories. The new policy reduced HS/HE IRs by 35% to 100%, depending on the WBGT category. Our results may be generalizable to other states with hot and humid climates similar to that of Georgia.},

   abstract = {Context: Walking speed is a fundamental parameter of human motion and is increasingly considered as an important indicator of individuals' health status. Objective: To evaluate the relationship of gait parameters, and demographic and physical characteristics in healthy men and women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Recruitment of a subsample (n = 358) of male and female blood donors taking part in the Cambridge CardioResource study. Collection of demographic data, measurement of physical characteristics (height, weight and blood pressure) and assessment of 7-day, free-living activity parameters using accelerometry and a novel algorithm to measure walking speed. Participants were a median (interquartile range[IQR]) age of 49 (16) years; 45% women; and had a median (IQR) BMI of 26 (5.4). Main Outcome Measure: Walking speed. Results: In this study, the hypothesis that walking speed declines with age was generated using an initial 'open' dataset. This was subsequently validated in a separate 'closed' dataset that showed a decrease of walking speed of -0.0037 m/s per year. This is equivalent to a difference of 1.2 minutes, when walking a distance of 1 km aged 20 compared to 60 years. Associations between walking speed and other participant characteristics (i.e. gender, BMI and blood pressure) were non-significant. BMI was negatively correlated with the number of walking and running steps and longest non-stop distance. Conclusion: This is the first study using accelerometry which shows an association between walking speed and age in free-living, healthy individuals. Absolute values of gait speed are comparable to published normal ranges in clinical settings. This study highlights the potential use of mobile accelerometry to assess gait parameters which may be indicative of future health outcomes in healthy individuals. © 2011 Schimpl et al.},

This study combines excess non-accidental mortality counts, numerical weather simulations, US Census and parcel data into an assessment of vulnerability to heat in Houston, Texas. Specifically, a hierarchical model with spatially varying coefficients is used to account for differences in vulnerability among census block groups. Socio-economic and demographic variables from census and parcel data are selected via a forward selection algorithm where at each step the remaining variables are orthogonalized with respect to the chosen variables to account for collinearity. Daily minimum temperatures and composite heat indices (e.g. discomfort index) provide a better model fit than other ambient temperature measurements (e.g. maximum temperature, relative humidity). Positive interactions between elderly populations and heat exposure were found suggesting these populations are more responsive to increases in heat. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extreme heat poses current and future risks to human health. Heat vulnerability indices (HVIs), commonly developed using principal components analysis (PCA), are mapped to identify populations vulnerable to extreme heat. Few studies critically assess implications of analytic choices made when employing this methodology for fine-scale vulnerability mapping. OBJECTIVE: We investigated sensitivity of HVIs created by applying PCA to input variables and whether training input variables on heat–health data produced HVIs with similar spatial vulnerability patterns for Detroit, Michigan, USA. METHODS: We acquired 2010 Census tract and block group level data, land cover data, daily ambient apparent temperature, and all-cause mortality during May–September, 2000–2009. We used PCA to construct HVIs using: a) “unsupervised”—PCA applied to variables selected a priori as risk factors for heat-related health outcomes; b) “supervised”—PCA applied only to variables significantly correlated with proportion of all-cause mortality occurring on extreme heat days (i.e., days with 2-d mean apparent temperature above month-specific 95th percentiles). RESULTS: Unsupervised and supervised HVIs yielded differing spatial vulnerability patterns, depending on selected land cover input variables. Supervised PCA explained 62% of variance in the input variables and was applied on half the variables used in the unsupervised method. Census tract–level supervised HVI values were positively associated with increased proportion of mortality occurring on extreme heat days; supervised PCA could not be applied to block group data. Unsupervised HVI values were not associated with extreme heat mortality for either tracts or block groups. DISCUSSION: HVIs calculated using PCA are sensitive to input data and scale. Supervised HVIs may provide marginally more specific indicators of heat vulnerability than unsupervised HVIs. PCA-derived HVIs address correlation among vulnerability indicators, although the resulting output requires careful contextual interpretation beyond generating epidemiological research questions. Methods with reliably stable outputs should be leveraged for prioritizing heat interventions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4030.},

Policies to increase heat stress resilience are mostly isolated across different disciplines and government departments. A holistic approach would be necessary that mitigates the numerous negative impacts of heatwaves on public health, urban infrastructure and services through adaptation to heatwaves in the realm of public health, building and construction industry, and urban planning and infrastructure. This paper reviews the research on heat stress adaptation measures, before presenting recommendations for a range of integrated policy measures to increase the heat stress resilience of urban populations in Australian cities. The recommended policy measures include information dissemination, incentives and disincentives, promotion, demonstration and regulations.

   abstract = {Introduction: Spending a few hours to cool down in a cooling center reduces the impact of heat on health. But limited or lack of accessibility of these facilities is often a barrier to their utilization. The objective of this study was to assess accessibility of the cooling centers to heat-vulnerable populations in New York State (NYS) by various modes of transportation. Methods: We estimate the proximity of 377 cooling centers to general and heat-vulnerable populations in NYS (excluding New York City (NYC)) and determine their accessibility via walking, public transportation and driving. Distances between tract populations and nearest cooling center, and between cooling centers and public transportation stops were estimated. Accessibility in four metropolitan regions was determined via public transportation while accessibility in heat-vulnerable rural areas was estimated via driving. Results: Distances to nearest cooling center ranged from 0 to 53.2 miles with only a third of NYS population within walking distance (0.5 miles) of a cooling center. About 51% of heat-vulnerable tracts were within 0.5 miles, with an average distance of 2.4 miles to the nearest cooling center. Within the four metro politan regions 80% of cooling centers within 0.5 miles of a public transportation stop. All cooling centers in heat-vulnerable tracts were accessible via public transportation. In rural heat-vulnerable tracts, driving distances averaged at about 18 miles. Conclusions: In urban areas many residents were not within walking distance of a cooling center, but most, and nearly all in the most heat-vulnerable areas, were within walking distance of public transportation to a cooling center. In rural locations distances were longer, and accessibility is a greater issue. Cooling centers can be a valuable resource for general and heat-vulnerable populations during an extreme heat event. When planning and implementing cooling centers, it is therefore important to improve accessibility and address other barriers that can hamper their utilization.},

   abstract = {Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)},

   abstract = {The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in a heightened state of precarity, as studies observe that vulnerable communities—especially those within urban areas in the United States—are disproportionately exposed to extreme heat. Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between “redlining”, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 ◦C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 ◦C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.},

   abstract = {There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms "health disparities," "health inequalities," or "health equity." The definitions can have important practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups-such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination-systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. ("Social advantage" refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category-e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group-and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities. Copyright © 2006 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

This study presents findings of the first known impact assessment to compare the regional impacts of projected changes in the climate on the golf industry in Canada (or internationally). Empirical relationships between daily rounds played and four weather variables were defined through multiple regression analysis and then used to examine the potential impacts of two climate change scenarios on the length of the golf season and the number of rounds played in three regions of Canada (West Coast, Great Lakes, East Coast). Regionally, the West Coast region was projected to benefit the least from projected climate change, as golf courses that are currently open year round experienced only slight projected increases in rounds played in the 2020s and 2050s. Golf courses in the Great Lakes region could experience a 10- to 51-day longer average golf season and a 21 percent to 3 percent increase in rounds as early as the 2020s, and an even more pronounced increase in the 2050s. East Coast golf courses were projected to benefit the most under both climate change scenarios, experiencing larger gains in average operating seasons (25 to 45 days in the 2020s) and a 40 percent to 48 percent increase in rounds played by as early as the 2020s. © 2007 Canadian Association of Geographers / L'Association Canadienne des Géographes.},

The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps.

OBJECTIVES One objective has been to obtain a better understanding of the three-dimensional structure of a landfalling falling baroclinic wave along the U.S. West coast using the Penn State/National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) in an idealized configuration. There have been a growing number of field case studies investigating this terrain-frontal interaction, such as Colle et al. (2002) supported by this project, but idealized simulations provide a more systematic investigation of how terrain changes the structure and dynamical balances of a landfalling front. To investigate air-sea interactions along the East coast, the NOAA Wavewatch III (WW3) has been setup to run in real-time over the western Atlantic using surface wind forcing from the real-time MM5 and NCEP GFS models. Specific experiments have been designed to exchange surface forcing between the MM5 and WW3 in order to quantify the wave field impact on the development of nor-easters along the East Coast. This work helps determine whether a fully coupled modeling system is needed for nor-easters during the cool season over this region. Improving mesoscale predictability in the coastal zone requires the use of mesoscale ensembles. However, it is not clear how to construct this ensemble in terms of different physics and initial conditions. This project has begun to explore this for the landfall of hurricane Floyd on 16 September 1999 along the U.S. East Coast, and an 18-member real-time ensemble system has also been constructed to better understand the use of ensembles along the East Coast. The final goal of this past year has been to better understand some of the mesoscale weather along the East Coast, such as the sea breeze and transient evolution of convection near the coast. The sea breezes across southern New England are complicated by Long Island and the urban centers. APPROACH The MM5 has been employed to investigate the physical processes of frontal and cyclone},

The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities.},

Domestic and international policies in response focus primarily on prevention of future climate impacts on society through the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Academic and political attention is also largely focused on issues of mitigation. Adaptation refers to adjustments in individual, group, and institutional behavior in order to reduce society’s vulnerabilities to climate, and thus reduce its impacts. In 1996, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote that adaptation offers a ‘very powerful option’ for responding to climate change and ought to be viewed as a ‘complement’ to mitigation efforts. Yet, the IPCC also wrote that ‘little attention has been paid to any possible tradeoff between both types of options’.

   abstract = {It has been known for a long time that the environment shapes the appearance of vegetation (vegetation structure). The systematic description of these effects has led to classifications of life forms at the organismic scale and biomes at the global scale by Alexander von Humboldt, Christen C. Raunkiær, Wladimir Koppen, and other early plant geographers and plant ecologists. Consequently, plant traits and processes carried out by plants (vegetation function) are influenced by climate and other environmental conditions. However, given the previous limitations of both observations and theory, systematic and comparative studies of plant ecology and physiological ecology only began in the twentieth century. Through their adaptive and genetic constitutions, plants can react to environmental changes by different mechanisms involving various time scales. These mechanisms include acclimation, plasticity, and evolution. Plant reactions, in turn, can feed back to influence the environment at different scales by exchanges of matter and energy. For example, plants humidify the air, change turbulence and wind field, and hence influence cloud formation; they absorb carbon dioxide, produce oxygen and reactive volatile organic compounds, and modify, protect, and stabilize soils. There are a large variety of techniques available to researchers for the observation of vegetation-environment interactions at different time scales. No single technique can answer all questions; they have to be used synergistically, and often times these "suites" of observations have to be deployed across broad geographic areas and in multiple types of biomes. Due to the complexity of interactions and feedbacks between vegetation and the environment, numerical modeling has become a pivotal tool in conjunction with model-data fusion techniques. This new emphasis on fusing observations and theory has provided scientists with unprecedented insight into the mechanisms governing plant-atmosphere interactions, permitted the scaling of mechanisms across broad spans of space and time, and provided an integrated picture of global ecological processes.},

   abstract = {Key to understanding the implications of climate and land use change on biodiversity and natural resources is to incorporate the physiographic platform on which changes in ecological systems unfold. Here, we advance a detailed classification and high-resolution map of physiography, built by combining landforms and lithology (soil parent material) at multiple spatial scales. We used only relatively static abiotic variables (i.e., excluded climatic and biotic factors) to prevent confounding current ecological patterns and processes with enduring landscape features, and to make the physiographic classification more interpretable for climate adaptation planning. We generated novel spatial databases for 15 landform and 269 physiographic types across the conterminous United States of America. We examined their potential use by natural resource managers by placing them within a contemporary climate change adaptation framework, and found our physiographic databases could play key roles in four of seven general adaptation strategies. We also calculated correlations with common empirical measures of biodiversity to examine the degree to which the physiographic setting explains various aspects of current biodiversity patterns. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between landform diversity and measures of climate change to explore how changes may unfold across a geophysical template. We found landform types are particularly sensitive to spatial scale, and so we recommend using high-resolution datasets when possible, as well as generating metrics using multiple neighborhood sizes to both minimize and characterize potential unknown biases. We illustrate how our work can inform current strategies for climate change adaptation. The analytical framework and classification of landforms and parent material are easily extendable to other geographies and may be used to promote climate change adaptation in other settings.},

   abstract = {To improve the depiction of autumn through spring land-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks within regional and global weather, climate, and hydrologic models, a Subgrid SNOW Distribution (SSNOWD) submodel that explicitly includes subgrid snow-depth and snow-cover variability has been developed. From both atmospheric and hydrologic perspectives, the subgrid snow-depth distribution is an important quantity to account for within large-scale models. In the natural system, these subgrid snow-depth distributions are largely responsible for the mosaic of snow-covered and snow-free areas that develop as the snow melts, and the impacts of these fractional areas must be quantified in order to realistically simulate grid-averaged surface fluxes. SSNOWD's formulation incorporates observational studies showing that snow distributions can be described by a lognormal distribution and the snow-depth coefficient of variation. Using an understanding of the physical processes that lead to these observed snow-depth variations, a global distribution of nine subgrid snow-depth-variability categories was developed, and coefficient-of-variation values were assigned to each category based on published measurements. In addition, SSNOWD adopts the physically realistic approach of performing separate surface-energy-balance calculations over the snow-covered and snow-free portions of each model grid cell and weighing the resulting fluxes according to these fractional areas. Using a climate version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (ClimRAMS) over a North American domain, SSNOWD was compared with a snow-cover formulation similar to those currently used in most general circulation models. The simulations indicated that accounting for snow-distribution variability has a significant impact on snow-cover evolution and associated energy and moisture fluxes. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {A detailed model of Alpine surface processes is used to simulate the amount of preferential deposition as well as redistribution of snow due to snowdrift for two alpine glaciers (Goldbergkees and Kleinfleißkees, Austrian Alps). The sequence of snow-cover modelling consists of the simulation of the wind field with a mesoscale atmospheric model, a three-dimensional finite-element drift module, an energy-balance module and a snowpack module. All modules with the exception of the wind-field model are integrated within the Alpine3D model frame. The drift module of Alpine3D distinguishes between saltation and suspension and is able to capture preferential deposition of snow precipitation and redistribution of previously deposited snow. Validation of the simulated snow depth is done using the spatially dense snow-probing dataset collected during a campaign in May 2003. Simulated snow depths agree with measurements during winter 2002/03 at locations with detailed snow-height monitoring, taking into account the high spatial variability of snow depth on the glacier. Moreover, comparison of snow accumulation from model results with detailed probing on 1 May 2003 for the total glacier area shows that Alpine3D is able to capture major patterns of spatial distribution of snow accumulation. For the first time, the Alpine3D approach of using high-resolution wind fields from a meteorological model and a physical description of snow transport could be validated for a very steep glacierized area and for a full accumulation season. The results show that drift is a dominant factor to be considered for detailed glacier mass balances. Another dominant factor not considered in this study may be snow redistribution due to avalanches.},

   abstract = {Exertional heat illness can affect athletes during high-intensity or longduration exercise and result in withdrawal from activity or collapse during or soon after activity. These maladies include exercise associated muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, or exertional heatstroke. While certain individuals are more prone to collapse from exhaustion in the heat (i.e., not acclimatized, using certain medications, dehydrated, or recently ill), exertional heatstroke (EHS) can affect seemingly healthy athletes even when the environment is relatively cool. EHS is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 40-C accompanied by symptoms or signs of organ system failure, most frequently central nervous system dysfunction. Early recognition and rapid cooling can reduce both the morbidity and mortality associated with EHS. The clinical changes associated with EHS can be subtle and easy to miss if coaches, medical personnel, and athletes do not maintain a high level of awareness and monitor at-risk athletes closely. Fatigue and exhaustion during exercise occur more rapidly as heat stress increases and are the most common causes of withdrawal from activity in hot conditions. When athletes collapse from exhaustion in hot conditions, the term heat exhaustion is often applied. In some cases, rectal temperature is the only discernable difference between severe heat exhaustion and EHS in on-site evaluations. Heat exhaustion will generally resolve with symptomatic care and oral fluid support. Exercise associated muscle cramping can occur with exhaustive work in any temperature range, but appears to be more prevalent in hot and humid conditions. Muscle cramping usually responds to rest and replacement of fluid and salt (sodium). Prevention strategies are essential to reducing the incidence of EHS, heat exhaustion, and exercise associated muscle cramping. ©2007The American College of Sports Medicine.},

   abstract = {The potential consequences of occupational heat stress in a changing climate on workers, workplaces, and global economies are substantial. Occupational heat stress risk is projected to become particularly high in middle-and low-income tropical and subtropical regions, where optimal controls may not be readily available. This commentary presents occupational heat stress in the context of climate change, reviews its impacts, and reflects on implications for heat stress assessment and control. Future efforts should address limitations of existing heat stress assessment methods and generate economical, practical, and universal approaches that can incorporate data of varying levels of detail, depending on resources. Validation of these methods should be performed in a wider variety of environments, and data should be collected and analyzed centrally for both local and large-scale hazard assessments and to guide heat stress adaptation planning. Heat stress standards should take into account variability in worker acclimatization, other vulnerabilities, and workplace resources. The effectiveness of controls that are feasible and acceptable should be evaluated. Exposure scientists are needed, in collaboration with experts in other areas, to effectively prevent and control occupational heat stress in a changing climate. r e-con te x t uA li zin g o ccupAtion A l He At str e ss Heat stress in occupational populations is a moving target. Global climate change, which includes both changes in mean weather conditions and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (IPCC, 2013), will change the pattern of occupational heat stress risks over time. Workers in tropical and subtropical regions, many of whom are involved in heavy physical work outdoors or indoors without effective cooling, are at particularly high risk (Kjellstrom et al., 2013). Unacclimatized workers in temperate regions are also at increased risk of heat stress, especially during heat waves (Adam-Poupart et al., 2013). Workers in large cities may experience greater heat exposures, relative to their rural counterparts, as a result of urban heat island effects (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). A complex picture emerges when work is viewed in the context of climate change. Heat stress risk will vary by industry and occupation over time not only as a result of spatiotemporal changes in weather conditions},

   abstract = {This study examines issues of Small Area Estimation that are raised by reliance on the American Community Survey (ACS), which reports tract-level data based on much smaller samples than the decennial census long-form that it replaced. We demonstrate the problem using a 100% transcription of microdata from the 1940 census. By drawing many samples from two major cities, we confirm a known pattern: random samples yield unbiased point estimates of means or proportions, but estimates based on smaller samples have larger average errors in measurement and greater risk of large error. Sampling variability also inflates estimates of measures of variation across areas (reflecting segregation or spatial inequality). This variation is at the heart of much contemporary spatial analysis. We then evaluate possible solutions. For point estimates, we examine three Bayesian models, all of which reduce sampling variation, and we encourage use of such models to correct ACS small area estimates. However, the corrected estimates cannot be used to calculate estimates of variation, because smoothing toward local or grand means artificially reduces variation. We note that there are potential Bayesian approaches to this problem, and we demonstrate an efficacious alternative that uses the original sample data.},

   abstract = {Population estimates are critical for government services, development projects, and public health campaigns. Such data are typically obtained through a national population and housing census. However, population estimates can quickly become inaccurate in localized areas, particularly where migration or displacement has occurred. Some conflict-affected and resource-poor countries have not conducted a census in over 10 y. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate population numbers in small areas based on enumeration data from sample areas and nationwide information about administrative boundaries, building locations, settlement types, and other factors related to population density. We demonstrated this model by estimating population sizes in every 10- m grid cell in Nigeria with national coverage. These gridded population estimates and areal population totals derived from them are accompanied by estimates of uncertainty based on Bayesian posterior probabilities. The model had an overall error rate of 67 people per hectare (mean of absolute residuals) or 43% (using scaled residuals) for predictions in out-of-sample survey areas (approximately 3 ha each), with increased precision expected for aggregated population totals in larger areas. This statistical approach represents a significant step toward estimating populations at high resolution with national coverage in the absence of a complete and recent census, while also providing reliable estimates of uncertainty to support informed decision making.},

   abstract = {Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic focused attention on city parks as important public resources. However, it is unknown how city park use in 2020 compared to prior years and whether COVID-19 may have exacerbated racial/ethnic inequities in access. Moreover, traditional methods of measuring park use present major drawbacks.

Methods We analyzed monthly mobility data derived from a large panel of smartphone devices, cross-referenced with a database of parks locations sourced from local agencies. We assessed park use trends in 44 of the 50 most populous U.S. cities from January 2018 to November 2020 using interrupted time series regressions. We also compared parks to other city amenities ( e . g ., gyms and libraries).

Results Based on a sample of 5,559 city parks, park visits declined by 14.6% (95% CI [9.2, 19.7], p < 0.001) from March through November 2020, compared to prior levels and trends. When we segmented the COVID-19 period by time of widespread closures (March-April) and partial-to-full reopenings (May-November), we estimated a larger reduction during closures (35.7% reduction, 95% CI [33.5, 37.8], p < 0.001) compared to the reduction during reopenings (8.0% reduction, 95% CI [1.9, 13.7], p = 0.001). Reductions for other amenities were more prolonged. In park service areas where a greater proportion of residents were White, reopening was associated with more visits, suggesting that racial privilege influenced access.

Conclusions Smartphone mobility data can address a data availability gap for monitoring park use. Park use only declined modestly in 2020. Opportunities exist to make access more racially equitable.

Significance statement Parks are public resources that promote health. Little is known about how parks have been used during the COVID-19 pandemic, when parks have become particularly important public spaces. This study introduces an approach to monitor park use over time, using location data from smartphones. This approach enabled the authors to evaluate trends in park use during the pandemic, including major gaps in visits to parks according to whether they mostly served White residents or residents of color. This big data approach offers advantages over traditional methods for monitoring park use and can help city officials to identify and address inequities in park access.

   abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 33 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths globally, as of 1 October 2020. During the lockdown and restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 and government response policies to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily from Google’s Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks, under the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as well as for park design and development. In particular, parks could be utilized during pandemics to increase the physical and mental health and social well-being of individuals.</p>},

   abstract = {With increasing concern about rising rates of obesity, public health researchers have begun to examine the availability of parks and other spaces for physical activity, particularly in cities, to assess whether access to parks reduces the risk of obesity. Much of the research in this field has shown that proximity to parks may support increased physical activity in urban environments; however, as yet, there has been limited consideration of environmental impediments or disamenities that might influence individuals’ perceptions or usage of public recreation opportunities. Prior research suggests that neighborhood disamenities, for instance crime, pedestrian safety, and noxious land uses, might dissuade people from using parks or recreational facilities and vary by neighborhood composition. Motivated by such research, this study estimates the relationship between neighborhood compositional characteristics and measures of park facilities, controlling for variation in neighborhood disamenities, using geographic information systems (GIS) data for New York City parks and employing both kernel density estimation and distance measures. The central finding is that attention to neighborhood disamenities can appreciably alter the relationship between neighborhood composition and spatial access to parks. Policy efforts to enhance the recreational opportunities in urban areas should expand beyond a focus on availability to consider also the hazards and disincentives that may influence park usage.},

From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with high level of education (48.86% bachelor’s degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was ―a biological weapon designed by the Chinese government.‖ About 94% of the respondents identified ―contact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughing‖ as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). ―Regular hand washing and social distancing‖ was selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported ―consuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soups‖ as preventive measures against COVID-19. Majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly; and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) are the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19. Their perceptions of COVID-19 bear implications across public health initiatives, compliance with precautionary behavior as well as bilateral relations with foreign nations. Evidence-based campaign should be intensified to remove misconceptions and promote precautionary measures. Keywords:},

Even less well documented and understood is how the sleeping thermal environment is affected by occupant behaviors such as the use of air-conditioning (AC) and electric fans, or window operations. In this paper we present results from a questionnaire survey administered to assess summertime bedroom thermal satisfaction and heat-coping strategies among New York City (NYC) residents. Specifically, we investigated current AC usage in bedrooms and examined alternate cooling strategies, cooling appliance usage patterns, and the motivations that drove these patterns during the 2015 summer. Among survey respondents (n=706), AC was the preferred heat-coping strategy, and for 30% of respondents was the only strategy used. Electric fan use and window opening were deemed ineffective for cooling by many respondents. Indeed, less than a quarter of all respondents ever opened windows to alleviate heat in their bedrooms. In general, people utilized strategies that modify the environment more than the individual person. Unsurprisingly, the frequency and overall use of AC were significantly associated with greater bedroom thermal satisfaction; however, setting AC to a lower temperature provided no additional benefit. In contrast, more frequent use of electric fans was associated with lower thermal satisfaction. In addition, 14.7% of all respondents did not have AC in their sleeping environment and 5.8% were without any AC at home. Despite the high penetration of AC ownership, usage cost was still a major concern for most. This work contributes to a better understanding of bedtime heat-coping strategies, cooling appliance usage patterns, and associated thermal satisfaction in NYC. The findings of this study suggest resident AC usage patterns may not be optimized for thermal satisfaction. Potential alternative cooling approaches could be explored to better balance maximizing thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.},

Using the alternative framing of retailer redlining, I analyze the rapid growth of dollar stores in twenty-seven metropolitan areas in the United States. Locations for these stores increased by 62 percent nationally during this time period, an expansion that was consistent in all regions of the country. Using descriptive statistics, cross-sectional, and first-difference models, I analyze how neighborhoods’ racial makeup was associated with changes in dollar store proximity, controlling for household income, population, and overall retailer density. This analysis shows that proximity to dollar stores is highly associated with neighborhoods of color even when controlling for other factors. This result highlights how the growth of dollar stores and similar spaces designed for economically precarious households both reflect and, potentially, contribute to long histories of racial exclusion.},

   abstract = {Introduction Diabetes rates continue to grow in the United States. Effectively addressing the epidemic requires better understanding of the distribution of disease and the geographic clustering of factors that influence it. Variations in the prevalence of diabetes at the local level are largely unreported, making understanding the disparities associated with the disease more difficult. Diabetes death rates during the past 15 years in Duval County, Florida, have been disproportionately high compared with the rest of the state. Methods We analyzed multiple sources of secondary data related to diabetes illness and death in Duval County, including data on hospital discharge, emergency department (ED) use, and vital statistics. We accessed diabetes and diabetes-related ED use and hospitalization and death data by using codes from the International Classification of Diseases versions 9 and 10. We analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey for Duval County and adapted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighting formulas for subcounty analysis. We used relative risk-type disease ratios and geographic information systems mapping to analyze data. Results The urban, mostly minority, low-socioeconomic area of Duval County had twice the rate of diabetes-related illness and death as other areas of the county, and the inner-city, poor area of the county had almost 3 times the rate of hospitalization and ED use for diabetes and diabetes-related conditions compared with the other areas of the county. Conclusion Our analyses show that diabetes-related disparities affect not only people and their families but also the community that absorbs the costs associated with the disproportionate health care use that results from these disparities. Analyzing data at the subcounty level has implications for health care planning and public health policy development at the local level.},

   abstract = {Household water insecurity is a global threat to human health and development, yet existing metrics lack a systematic consideration of geographic inequality and spatial variation. In this article, we introduce the notion of plumbing poverty as a conceptual and methodological heuristic to examine the intersectional nature of infrastructure, space, and social inequality. Plumbing poverty is understood in a dual sense: first, as a material and infrastructural condition produced by social relations that fundamentally vary through space and, second, as a methodology that operationalizes the spatial exploration of social inequality. Drawing on millions of census records, we strip household water security down to a single vital measure—the presence of complete household plumbing—to assess its spatial and sociodemographic trends. We identify distinct hot spots (geographic clusters of higher than average values) of plumbing poverty, track its social and spatial variance, and expose its fundamentally racialized nature. Our study finds that plumbing poverty is neither spatially nor socially random in the United States. Rather, plumbing incompleteness is spatially clustered in certain regions of the country and is clearly racialized: Living in an American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, or Hispanic household increases the odds of being plumbing poor, and these predictors warp and woof through space. In considering who experiences the slow violence of infrastructural dysfunction, a geography that is simultaneously ignored and unevenly expressed in the United States, we argue that analyses of space and social difference are central to understanding household water insecurity and must be prioritized in the development of cross-comparable metrics and global measurement tools. Key Words: census microdata, hot spot analysis, household water insecurity, infrastructural geographies, IPUMS.},

These filled areas were later developed into parks, school sites and residential areas. Lead in soil at these sites was the major toxicant of concern and driver of clean-up actions. During the period of assessment of lead-levels in soil, there were no established lines of communication between the City and residents of affected neighborhoods resulting in mistrust in the community. To address communication issues, a community-based, culturally sensitive Community Environmental Toxicology Curriculum (CETC) and a short video were developed for community stakeholders to inform them of risks, health effects, remediation processes and preventive measures. Pre-and post-tests were developed to measure knowledge gained from the toxicology training. Learning gains averaged 47% and 24% for the community leaders and residents respectively. Most participants strongly agreed that the community toxicology curriculum was a useful tool for promoting awareness of environmental risks in their community and addressing the gap in trust between residents and agencies involved in site remediation.},

The analysis explores the tradeoffs between opportunity and accessibility inherent in many neighborhoods throughout the county. It finds that voucher holders' locations lag substantially behind other residential locations in terms of opportunity measures but are more comparable in terms of accessibility. Further analysis finds differences in opportunity and accessibility among subgroups of voucher holders by various demographic characteristics. The study recommends the incorporation of opportunity and accessibility for voucher holders into local housing planning, including the implementation of proposed rules for Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.},

   abstract = {Increasingly, cities in rapidly growing regions are promoting redevelopment to achieve denser, mixed use patterns thought crucial to environmental sustainability. Redevelopment often threatens older apartments, built in the 1970s and early 1980s during a building boom fostered by federal tax incentives. While often these aging apartments are a poor fit for the family households who inhabit them, they have become the largest stock of rental housing affordable to very low income residents. Replacing this stock of centrally located, transit accessible affordable housing would be extraordinarily expensive. City planners view these complexes as the opposite of the mixed use, pedestrian-friendly development needed in cities. Affordable housing agencies are concerned with preserving existing subsidized housing. Yet arguably, both planners and housers should be concerned about the loss of these aging apartments. Displacement of large numbers of low-income transit dependent residents from the central core of cities works against planners' environmental goals and adds to the number of households in need of subsidized housing. It also undermines existing lowincome communities. This paper examines the prospects for preservation of older, affordable apartments in Dallas and Austin, chosen to contrast the role that comprehensive planning might play in bridging housing and planning goals. © 2010 Community Development Society.},

One goal of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, which provides rental assistance to low-income families, is the deconcentration of poverty. This study is a longitudinal analysis of the HCV program's deconcentration effectiveness in Broward County, Florida. The movement of HCV households before and after voucher assignment is examined. Spatial statistics reveal that HCV recipients are highly clustered in low opportunity areas both prior to and after receiving a voucher. Factors that significantly relate to the likelihood that a voucher recipient will or will not move to an area of higher opportunity are assessed. Results from an opportunity index derived from principal components analysis and an ordinary least squares regression model indicate that being non-Black, having a larger household, and originating from economically distressed areas with high poverty and unemployment relates more strongly to relocation to neighborhoods with greater opportunity.},

This study finds that one additional day with a maximum temperature of 30–32 °C (86–89.6 °F), relative to a day with a temperature of 28–30 °C (82.4–86 °F), decreases the birth rate 9 months later by 0.24%, or 92 babies per month in South Korea. This result is robust to various specifications and samples. This study also found that the impact of the temperature bin did not vary according to the mother’s characteristics, including education and age. That is, high temperature has no differential effect on mothers of different backgrounds. Finally, we found no significant temperature effect on birth outcomes, but we cannot rule out that children born 9 months after summer heat are a selected (healthy) group.},

   abstract = {Background: Previous studies have reported that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) affects the incidence of premature births. In addition, recent studies have suggested that heat waves have a negative impact on birth outcomes. However, the combined effect of PM2.5 and heat waves on the incidence of premature birth is controversial. This study investigated the independent and combined effects of PM2.5 and heat wave exposures during the 1st and 2nd trimesters on premature birth. Methods: The National Statistical Office of Korea provided birth data from 2010 to 2016. Preterm birth was defined as birth between 22 and 36 weeks. To assess the exposure to PM2.5 and heat waves, we used PM2.5 data estimated by the Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) and heat wave warning data provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. A multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the risk of preterm birth according to the exposure to PM2.5 and heat waves during the 1st and 2nd trimesters, and it was adjusted for residential area, year of birth, season of birth, parity, education level of the mother, age of the mother, and sex of the baby. Results: In the 2nd trimester, compared with the 0 h of heat wave exposure (≤67 percentile), 62.50–314.00 h (79–88 percentile) and>315.00 h of heat wave exposure (>88 percentile) were both significantly associated with preterm birth (OR for 79–88 percentile, 1.037, 95% CI, 1.003–1.073; OR for > 88 percentile, 1.174, 95% CI, 1.134–1.215). However, PM2.5 exposure was not significantly associated with preterm birth. On the other hand, in the analysis to evaluate the combined effect of PM2.5 and heat wave exposures of the 2nd trimester, compared with 0 h of heat wave exposure (≤67 percentile) and<11.64 μg/m3 (≤25 percentile) of PM2.5, 11.64–22.74 μg/m3 (≤25 percentile), 22.74–27.58 μg/m3 (26–50 percentile), and 27.57–32.39 μg/m3 (51–75 percentile) of PM2.5 exposure combined with>315.00 h of heat wave exposure (>88 percentile) were all significantly associated with preterm birth. In addition, the effect size was increased with an increase of PM2.5 exposure (OR for ≤ 25 percentile, 1.148, 95% CI, 1.095–1.203; OR for 26–50 percentile, 1.248, 95% CI, 1.178–1.323; OR for 51–75 percentile, 1.370, 95% CI, 1.245–1.507). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the combined effect of heat wave and PM2.5 exposure during the 2nd trimester on the risk of preterm birth was greater than that of each exposure alone. In other words, exposure to PM2.5 increases the impact of heat waves on the risk of preterm birth. These results indicate that control of prenatal exposure to fine particular matter and extreme temperatures is important for the prevention of preterm birth.},

   abstract = {Wildfire smoke harms health. We add to this literature by evaluating the health effects of California's 2018 Carr Fire and preceding wildfire seasons in Shasta County. Methods With data from the Shasta County Health and Human Services Agency, we examined the link between weekly wildfire fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure estimated using a spatiotemporal multiple imputation approach and emergency department (ED) visits and mortality using time-series models that controlled for temporal trends and temperature. Results Between 2013 and 2018, Shasta County experienced 19 weeks with average wildfire PM2.5 ≥5.5 μg/m3 (hereafter, "high wildfire PM2.5 concentration"). Among all Shasta County Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs; n = 36), we detected no association between high wildfire PM2.5 concentrations and respiratory or circulatory disease-related ED visits or mortality. Subsequent analyses were confined to valley ZCTAs (n = 11, lower elevation, majority of population, worse air quality in general). In valley ZCTAs, high wildfire PM2.5 was associated with a 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2, 24.9) increase in same-week respiratory disease-related ED visits but no increase in the subsequent 2 weeks nor on circulatory disease-related mortality or ED visits or all-cause mortality. Two weeks after high wildfire PM2.5 weeks, respiratory disease-related deaths decreased (-31.5%, 95% CI = -64.4, 1.5). The 2018 Carr Fire appeared to increase respiratory disease-related ED visits by 27.0% (95% CI = 4.0, 50.0) over expectation and possibly reduce circulatory disease-related deaths (-18.2%, 95% CI = -39.4, 2.9). Conclusions As climate change fuels wildfire seasons, studies must continue to evaluate their health effects, particularly in highly exposed populations.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Preterm birth (PTB) refers to delivery before 37 weeks of gestation and represents the leading cause of early-life mortality and morbidity in developed countries. PTB can lead to serious infant health outcomes. The etiology of PTB remains uncertain, but epidemiologic studies have consistently shown elevated risks with different environmental variables as traffic-related air pollution (TRAP). The aim of the study was to evaluate with time series methodology the short-term effect of air pollutants, noise levels and ambient temperature on the number of births and preterm births occurred in Madrid City during the 2001–2009 period. 

METHODS
A time-series analysis was performed to assess the short term impact of daily mean concentrations (µg/m3) of PM2.5 and PM10, O3 and NO2. Measurements of Acoustic Pollution in dB(A) analyzed were: Leqd, equivalent diurnal noise level and Leqn, equivalent nocturnal noise level. Maximum and Minimum daily temperature (°C), mean Humidity in the air (%) and Atmospheric Pressure (HPa), were included too. Linear trends, seasonality, as well as the autoregressive nature of the series itself were controlled. We added as covariate the day of the week too. Autoregressive over-dispersed Poisson regression models were performed and the environmental variables were included with short-term lags (from 0 to 7 days) in reference to the date of birth. Firstly, simple models for the total number of births and preterm births were done separately. In a second stage, a model for total births adjusted for preterm births was performed. 

RESULTS
A total of 298,705 births were analyzed. The results of the final models were expressed in relative risks (RRs) for interquartile increase. We observed evidence of a short term effect at Lag 0, for the following environmental variables analyzed, PM2.5 (RR: 1.020; 95% CI:(1.008 1.032)) and O3 (RR: 1.012; 95% CI:(1.002 1.022)) concentrations and Leqd (RR: 1.139; 95% CI:( (1.124 1.154)) for the total number of births, and besides these, heat temperatures at Lag 1 (RR: 1.055; 95% CI:( (1.018 1.092)) on preterm births in Madrid City during the studied period. In the model adjusted for preterm births, similar RR was obtained for the same environmental variables. 

CONCLUSIONS
Especially PM2.5, diurnal noise levels and O3 have a short-term impact on total births and heat temperatures on preterm births in Madrid City during the studied period. Our results suggest that, given the widespread exposure of the population to the environmental factors analyzed and the possible effects on long-term health associated to low birth weight. There is a clear need to minimize this exposure through the decrease of air pollution and noise levels and through the behavior modification of the mothers.},

   abstract = {Although it is often acknowledged that social and environmental factors interact to produce racial and ethnic environmental health disparities, it is still unclear how this occurs. Despite continued controversy, the environmental justice movement has provided some insight by suggesting that disadvantaged communities face greater likelihood of exposure to ambient hazards. The exposure-disease paradigm has long suggested that differential "vulnerability" may modify the effects of toxicants on biological systems. However, relatively little work has been done to specify whether racial and ethnic minorities may have greater vulnerability than do majority populations and, further, what these vulnerabilities may be. We suggest that psychosocial stress may be the vulnerability factor that links social conditions with environmental hazards. Psychosocial stress can lead to acute and chronic changes in the functioning of body systems (e.g., immune) and also lead directly to illness. In this article we present a multidisciplinary framework integrating these ideas. We also argue that residential segregation leads to differential experiences of community stress, exposure to pollutants, and access to community resources. When not counterbalanced by resources, stressors may lead to heightened vulnerability to environmental hazards.},

Here we explore the role of the residential environment in the etiology of illness (specifically asthma) and the persistence of socioeconomic health disparities. Housing conditions, shaped by social forces, affect exposure to physical and chemical "toxicants," thereby translating social adversities into individual illness and population health disparities. We discuss the mediating role of housing in determining health outcomes at multiple levels (social-structural, neighborhood, and individual family). To date, little attention has been paid by most environmental health scientists to the social-structural conditions underlying gross inequities in the distribution of toxic exposures, with even less attention to the processes whereby these social conditions may directly affect susceptibility to the toxic exposures themselves. This chapter goes beyond traditional medical and environmental science models to incorporate a range of social and physical determinants of environmental pollutions, illustrating how these conditions result in health and illness. We focus here on childhood asthma as an example of a serious public health problem that has been associated with low income, minority status, and characteristics of the home environment. We end the chapter with a discussion of the environmental justice movement and the role of housing as a potential agent of change and focus of interventions aimed to reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollutants.},

   abstract = {Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality. Identifying potentially modifiable triggers toward the end of gestation, such as extreme heat, can improve understanding of the role of acute stress on early deliveries and inform warning systems. In this study we examined the association between extreme heat, variously defined during the last week of gestation, and risk of preterm birth among mothers in California. Methods: We created a population-based cohort comprised of 1,967,300 mothers who had live, singleton births in California, from May through September 2005–2013. Daily temperature data estimated at the maternal zip code of residence was used to create 12 definitions of extreme heat with varying relative temperatures (75th, 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles) and durations (at least 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days). We estimated risk of preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks) in relation to exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation with multi-level Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for maternal characteristics, sex of neonate, and seasonality. We also included randomly generated data, SAS code, and estimates for reproducibility purposes. Results: Approximately 7% of the cohort had a preterm birth. For all definitions of extreme heat, the risk of preterm birth was consistently higher among mothers who experienced an extreme heat episode during their last week of gestation. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.008 (95% CI: 0.997, 1.021) to 1.128 (95% CI: 1.052, 1.210), with increasing associations as the relative temperature and duration of extreme heat episode increased. Conclusion: This study adds to the previous literature by considering multiple definitions of extreme heat and applying a time-to-event framework. Findings suggest that acute exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation may trigger an earlier delivery. Implementing heat warning systems targeted toward pregnant women may improve birth outcomes.},

   abstract = {Restricting to live births can induce bias in studies of pregnancy and developmental outcomes, but whether this live-birth bias results in underestimating disparities is unknown. Bias may arise from collider stratification due to an unmeasured common cause of fetal loss and the outcome of interest, or depletion of susceptibles, where exposure differentially causes fetal loss among those with underlying susceptibility. Methods We conducted a simulation study to examine the magnitude of live-birth bias in a population parameterized to resemble one year of conceptions in California (N = 625,000). We simulated exposure to a non-time-varying environmental hazard, risk of spontaneous abortion, and time to live birth using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. Our outcome of interest was preterm birth. We included a social vulnerability factor to represent social disadvantage, and estimated overall risk differences for exposure and preterm birth using linear probability models and stratified by the social vulnerability factor. We calculated how often confidence intervals included the true point estimate (CI coverage probabilities) to illustrate whether effect estimates differed qualitatively from the truth. Results Depletion of susceptibles resulted in a larger magnitude of bias compared with collider stratification, with larger bias among the socially vulnerable group. Coverage probabilities were not adversely affected by bias due to collider stratification. Depletion of susceptibles reduced coverage, especially among the socially vulnerable (coverage among socially vulnerable = 46%, coverage among nonsocially vulnerable = 91% in the most extreme scenario). Conclusions In simulations, hazardous environmental exposures induced live-birth bias and the bias was larger for socially vulnerable women.},

   abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey ( n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63% of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

   abstract = {Previous research provided evidence of an association between short-term exposure to ozone and mortality risk and of heterogeneity in the risk across communities. The authors investigated whether this heterogeneity can be explained by community-specific characteristics: race, income, education, urbanization, transportation use, particulate matter and ozone levels, number of ozone monitors, weather, and use of air conditioning. Their study included data on 98 US urban communities for 1987 to 2000 from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study; US Census; and American Housing Survey. On average across the communities, a 10-ppb increase in the previous week's ozone level was associated with a 0.52% (95% posterior interval: 0.28, 0.77) increase in mortality. The authors found that community-level characteristics modify the relation between ozone and mortality. Higher effect estimates were associated with higher unemployment, fraction of the Black/African-American population, and public transportation use and with lower temperatures or prevalence of central air conditioning. These differences may relate to underlying health status, differences in exposure, or other factors. Results show that some segments of the population may face higher health burdens of ozone pollution. © The Author 2008. Published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

   abstract = {Given predictions of increased intensity and frequency of heat waves, it is important to study the effect of high temperatures on human mortality and morbidity. Many studies focus on heat wave-related mortality; however, heat-related morbidity is often overlooked. The goals of this study are to examine the historical observed relationship between temperature and morbidity (illness), and explore the extent to which observed historical relationships could be used to generate future projections of morbidity under climate change. We collected meteorological, air pollution, and hospital admissions data in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the years 1989-2005, and employed a generalized additive model (GAM) to quantify the relationship between morbidity (as measured by hospital admissions) and high 960 Climatic Change (2012) 110:959-976 temperatures with adjustment for the effects of potential confounders. We also estimated temperature threshold values for different causes of hospital admissions and then quantified the associated percent increase of admissions per degree above the threshold. Finally, the future impact of higher temperatures on admissions for the years 2059-2075 was examined. Our results show that five causes of admission (endocrine, genitourinary, renal, accidental, and self-harm) and three age groups (15-64, 75-84, >85 years) were affected by high temperatures. Future projections indicate a larger number of days above the current temperature threshold leading to an increase in admissions. Our results indicate that climate change may increase heat-related hospital admissions in the US urban mid-West and that health systems should include heat wave planning.},

   abstract = {The distribution of overall temperature and the frequency of heat waves may be shifting due to climate change. However, forecasting future health consequences of higher temperatures in a given city is complicated by uncertainties in how populations and societal infrastructure will adapt. This paper reviews approaches to address these challenges, including: (1) using historical weather–mortality relationships for the same region, or a location with a similar climate as the city of interest; (2) evaluating adaptation using the minimum mortality threshold (MMT) temperature (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate); and (3) estimating the impact of modifiers (e.g., air conditioning, population density, green space) on the temperature and mortality relation, and then predicting a range of effects based on plausible estimates for the future values of these parameters in a given city. Each approach can provide insight into how heat could affect mortality under a changing climate, but all have uncertainties. In spite of these limitations, projecting the future public health burden of temperature-related health effects can provide valuable information to aid public health and environmental authorities in planning and communicating the risks of climate change to the public.},

   abstract = {Background: Extreme heatwaves occurred in Adelaide, South Australia, in the summers of 2008 and 2009. Both heatwaves were unique in terms of their duration (15 days and 13 days respectively), and the 2009 heatwave was also remarkable in its intensity with a maximum temperature reaching 45.7°C. It is of interest to compare the health impacts of these two unprecedented heatwaves with those of previous heatwaves in Adelaide. Methods. Using case-series analysis, daily morbidity and mortality rates during heatwaves (35°C for three or more days) occurring in 2008 and 2009 and previous heatwaves occurring between 1993 and 2008 were compared with rates during all non-heatwave days (1 October to 31 March). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were established for ambulance call-outs, hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and mortality. Dose response effects of heatwave duration and intensity were examined. Results: Ambulance call-outs during the extreme 2008 and 2009 events were increased by 10% and 16% respectively compared to 4.4% during previous heatwaves. Overall increases in hospital and emergency settings were marginal, except for emergency department presentations in 2008, but increases in specific health categories were observed. Renal morbidity in the elderly was increased during both heatwaves. During the 2009 heatwave, direct heat-related admissions increased up to 14-fold compared to a three-fold increase seen during the 2008 event and during previous heatwaves. In 2009, marked increases in ischaemic heart disease were seen in the 15-64 year age group. Only the 2009 heatwave was associated with considerable increases in total mortality that particularly affected the 15-64 year age group (1.37; 95% CI, 1.09, 1.71), while older age groups were unaffected. Significant dose-response relationships were observed for heatwave duration (ambulance, hospital and emergency setting) and intensity (ambulance and mortality). Conclusions: While only incremental increases in morbidity and mortality above previous findings occurred in 2008, health impacts of the 2009 heatwave stand out. These findings send a signal that the intense and long 2009 heatwave may have exceeded the capacity of the population to cope. It is important that risk factors contributing to the adverse health outcomes are investigated to further improve preventive strategies. © 2011 Nitschke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Seasonal patterns of birth outcomes have been observed worldwide, and there was increasing evidence that ambient temperature played as a trigger of adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and stillbirth. To systematically review updated epidemiological evidence about the relationship between temperature exposure during pregnancy and PTB, LBW, and stillbirth, we searched for related studies published in English from electronic databases and references of identified papers. We only included original articles that directly reported the effects of prenatal temperature exposure on birth outcomes. The characteristics and main findings of included studies were examined. A total of 36 epidemiological studies were finally included in this review. Most of these studies focused on PTB and LBW, while less attention has been paid to stillbirth that was relatively rare in the occurrence. Several designs including ecological (e.g., descriptive and time-series) and retrospective cohort studies (e.g., case-crossover and time-to-event) were applied to assess temperature effects on birth outcomes. Temperature metrics and exposure windows varied greatly in these investigations. Exposure to high temperature was generally found to be associated with PTB, LBW, and stillbirth, while several studies also reported the adverse impact of low temperature on birth outcomes of PTB and LBW. Despite no conclusive causality demonstrated, the current evidence for adverse effect on birth outcomes was stronger for heat than for cold. In summary, the evidence linking birth outcomes with ambient temperature was still very limited. Consequently, more related studies are needed worldwide and should be conducted in diversified climate zones, so as to further ascertain the association between temperature and birth outcomes. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated study designs, more accurate estimation of temperature exposure during pregnancy, and more efficient methods to find out the exposure windows, as well as cold-related effects on birth outcomes.},

Both high and low temperatures were associated with PTB risk, adjusted OR (95% CI) respectively 2.57 (1.98–3.33) and 2.39 (1.93–2.95) for 0.5 °C increase in high temperature range (>18.2°C) and 0.5°C decrease in low temperature range (< 18.2°C). Specifically, PTB was significantly associated with ambient temperature and extreme heat/cold days during conception month and the third trimester. Sensitivity analysis indicated that female fetus were more susceptible to the risk of ambient temperature. Our study indicates that the risk of preterm birth due to high or low temperature may exist early during the conception month.},

   abstract = {Background: Extreme temperature is associated with adverse birth outcomes but it is unclear whether it increases early delivery risk. Objectives: We aimed to determine the association between ambient temperature and early delivery. Methods: Medical records from 223,375 singleton deliveries from 12 U.S. sites were linked to local ambient temperature. Exposure to hot (> 90th percentile) or cold (< 10th percentile) using site-specific and window-specific temperature distributions were defined for 3-months preconception, 7-week periods during the first two trimesters, 1 week preceding delivery, and whole pregnancy. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval for early deliveries associated with hot/cold exposures, adjusting for conception month, humidity, site, sex, maternal demographics, parity, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, pregnancy complications, and smoking or drinking during pregnancy. Acute temperature associations were estimated separately for warm (May–September) and cold season (October–April) in a case-crossover analysis using conditional logistic regression. Results: Compared with mild temperature (10–90th percentile), exposure to hot or cold during weeks 1–7 increased risk for early preterm (< 34 weeks) [RRhot: 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.21); RRcold: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.30)], late preterm (34–36 weeks) [RRcold: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15)], and early term (37–38 weeks) [RRhot: 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.07); RRcold: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.05)] delivery. Findings were similar for hot exposures during weeks 15–21. Examining deliveries at each week from 23 through 38, whole-pregnancy hot exposures increased delivery risk by 6–21% at weeks 34 and 36–38. In the case-crossover analysis, a 5°F increase during the week preceding delivery was associated with 12–16% higher and 4–5% lower early delivery risk during warm and cold season, respectively. Conclusions: Both acute and chronic ambient temperature extremes may affect early delivery risk.},

In the US context, "getting to zero" requires an explicit focus on health equity involving data collection, community engagement, and public investments in low-income communities, communities of color, and among road users most disproportionately involved in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Motor vehicle safety measures implemented throughout the 20 th century-like improved vehicle and roadway design, broader use of safety belts and car seats, and stronger drunk driving laws and enforcement-have contributed to substantial reductions in traffic-related death rates in the United States, even as annual vehicle miles traveled increased steadily during the same time period. 1 Despite this progress, traffic collisions remain a leading cause of death and disability in the US and are responsible for more deaths among children and young adults than any other cause. 2,3 Motor vehicle crashes resulted in more than 35,000 deaths-approximately 96 deaths per day-in 2014, and two million non-fatal injuries in 2013. 4,5 The US motor vehicle crash death rate of 10.3 deaths per 100,000 people far outstripped such deaths in peer nations in 2013. 6 Motor vehicle crashes are also extremely costly in the US with fatalities totaling $44 billion in medical and work loss costs in 2013 and injuries totaling $18 billion in lifetime medical costs and another $33 billion in lifetime work loss costs in 2012. 7,8 Injuries are not accidents-they are predictable and preventable. As the 20 th century experience demonstrates, employing comprehensive, integrated, and quality prevention strategies saves and improves lives and reduces healthcare, law enforcement, and other governmental and business costs to society. Today, nearly two decades into the 21 st century, promising traffic safety policies, programs, and initiatives are emerging. These include active transportation investments, Complete Streets policies, Safe Routes to School programs, and-the particular focus of this brief-Vision Zero initiatives. Vision Zero is a growing movement in cities across the US and around the globe to eliminate all traffic-related deaths and severe injuries within a designated time period. Distinct in its acknowledgement that traffic-related deaths and severe injuries are preventable, and its focus on improving traffic safety through systems-level approaches, Vision Zero strives for better transportation systems and infrastructure for vehicle traffic as well as for people who walk, ride bicycles, and use other forms of transportation. Vision Zero is a bold vision that is not only possible, but necessary. First implemented in Sweden in 1997, then successfully across Europe and other parts of the world, Vision Zero is now actively being implemented in over two dozen US cities from Anchorage, Alaska, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 9 Compared to other countries, there are major differences in travel behaviors,},

This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups—such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination—systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (“Social advantage” refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category—e.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group—and all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such health disparities/inequalities.</p>},

   abstract = {Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage-that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationali-sation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.},

This article defines and distinguishes between unavoidable health inequalities and unjust and preventable health inequities. We describe the dimensions along which health inequalities are commonly examined, including across the global population, between countries or states, and within geographies, by socially relevant groupings such as race/ethnicity, gender, education, caste, income, occupation, and more. Different theories attempt to explain group-level differences in health, including psychosocial, material deprivation, health behavior, environmental, and selection explanations. Concepts of relative versus absolute; dose-response versus threshold; composition versus context; place versus space; the life course perspective on health; causal pathways to health; conditional health effects; and group-level versus individual differences are vital in understanding health inequalities. We close by reflecting on what conditions make health inequalities unjust, and to consider the merits of policies that prioritize the elimination of health disparities versus those that focus on raising the overall standard of health in a population.},

This consensus statement emphasizes that optimal exertional heat illness management is promoted by a synchronized chain of survival that promotes rapid recognition and management, as well as communication between care teams. Health care providers should be confident in the definitions, etiologies, and nuances of exertional heat exhaustion, exertional heat injury, and EHS. Identifying the athlete with suspected EHS early in the course, stopping activity (body heat generation), and providing rapid total body cooling are essential for survival, and like any critical life-threatening situation (cardiac arrest, brain stroke, sepsis), time is tissue. Recovery from EHS is variable, and outcomes are likely related to the duration of severe hyperthermia. Most exertional heat illnesses can be prevented with the recognition and modification of well-described risk factors ideally addressed through leadership, policy, and on-site health care.},

COVID-19 potentially heightened the risk of heat-related health impacts in NYC, particularly on the most vulnerable communities, who often lack equitable access to adequate cooling mechanisms such as air conditioning (AC) and good quality green space. Here, we review some of the policies and tools which have been developed to reduce vulnerability to heat in NYC. We then present results from an online pilot survey of members of the environmental justice organization WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT) between July 11 and August 8, 2020, which asked questions to evaluate how those in Northern Manhattan coped with elevated summer heat in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also make some policy recommendations based on our initial findings. Results of our pilot survey suggest that people stayed indoors more due to COVID-19 and relied more on AC units to stay cool. Survey responses also indicated that some avoided visiting green spaces due to concerns around overcrowding and did not regularly frequent them due to the distance from their homes. The responses also demonstrate a potential racial disparity in AC access; AC ownership and access was highest amongst white and lowest amongst Latino/a/x and Black respondents. The impacts of COVID-19 have highlighted the need to accelerate efforts to improve preparedness for extreme heat like the City of New York’s AC and cooling center programs, heat ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) retrofitting, equitable green space expansion, and stronger environmental justice community networks and feedback mechanisms to hear from affected residents. Conducting a survey of this kind annually may provide an additional effective component of evaluating cooling initiatives in NYC.</p>},

A major increase in mortality was then observed, which main epidemiological features are described herein. Methods: The number of deaths observed from August to November 2003 in France was compared to those expected on the basis of the mortality rates observed from 2000 to 2002 and the 2003 population estimates. Results: From August 1st to 20th, 2003, 15,000 excess deaths were observed. From 35 years age, the excess mortality was marked and increased with age. It was 15% higher in women than in men of comparable age as of age 45 years. Excess mortality at home and in retirement institutions was greater than that in hospitals. The mortality of widowed, single and divorced subjects was greater than that of married people. Deaths directly related to heat, heatstroke, hyperthermia and dehydration increased massively. Cardiovascular diseases, ill-defined morbid disorders, respiratory diseases and nervous system diseases also markedly contributed to the excess mortality. The geographic variations in mortality showed a clear age-dependent relationship with the number of very hot days. No harvesting effect was observed. Conclusions: Heat waves must be considered as a threat to European populations living in climates that are currently temperate. While the elderly and people living alone are particularly vulnerable to heat waves, no segment of the population may be considered protected from the risks associated with heat waves. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite a vast air pollution epidemiology literature to date and the recognition that lower-socioeconomic status (SES) populations are often disproportionately exposed to pollution, there is little research identifying optimal means of adjusting for confounding by SES in air pollution epidemiology, nor is there a strong understanding of biases that may result from improper adjustment. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a conceptualization of SES and a review of approaches to its measurement in the U.S. context and discuss pathways by which SES may influence health and confound effects of air pollution. We explore bias related to measurement and operationalization and identify statistical approaches to reduce bias and confounding. DISCUSSION: Drawing on the social epidemiology, health geography, and economic literatures, we describe how SES, a multifaceted construct operating through myriad pathways, may be conceptualized and operationalized in air pollution epidemiology studies. SES varies across individuals within the contexts of place, time, and culture. Although no single variable or index can fully capture SES, many studies rely on only a single measure. We recommend examining multiple facets of SES appropriate to the study design. Furthermore, investigators should carefully consider the multiple mechanisms by which SES might be operating to identify those SES indicators that may be most appropriate for a given context or study design and assess the impact of improper adjustment on air pollution effect estimates. Last, exploring model contraction and expansion methods may enrich adjustment, whereas statistical approaches, such as quantitative bias analysis, may be used to evaluate residual confounding. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7980},

Most environmental inequality studies to date are cross-sectional and used proximity-based methods rather than modeled air pollution concentrations, limiting the ability to examine trends over time or the factors that drive exposure inequalities. In this paper, we use 1km2 modeled PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations in Massachusetts over an 8-year period and Census demographic data to quantify inequality between sociodemographic groups and to develop a more nuanced understanding of the drivers and trends in longitudinal air pollution inequality. Annual-average population-weighted PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were highest for urban non-Hispanic black populations (11.8µg/m3 in 2003 and 8.4µg/m3 in 2010, vs. 11.3µg/m3 and 8.1µg/m3 for urban non-Hispanic whites) and urban Hispanic populations (15.9 ppb in 2005 and 13.0 ppb in 2010, vs. 13.0 ppb and 10.2 ppb for urban non-Hispanic whites), respectively. While population groups experienced similar absolute decreases in exposure over time, disparities in population-weighted concentrations increased over time when quantified by the Atkinson Index, a relative inequality measure. Exposure inequalities were approximately one order of magnitude greater for NO2 compared to PM2.5, were more pronounced in urban compared to rural geographies, and between racial/ethnic groups compared to income and educational attainment groups. Our results also revealed similar longitudinal PM2.5 and NO2 inequality trends using Census 2000 and Census 2010 data, indicating that spatio-temporal shifts in air pollution may best explain observed trends in inequality. These findings enhance our understanding of factors that contribute to persistent inequalities and underscore the importance of targeted exposure reduction strategies aimed at vulnerable populations and neighborhoods.},

   abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is an essential tool for modelers to understand the influence of model parameters on model outputs. It is also increasingly used in developing and assessing physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models. For instance, several studies have applied global SA to reduce the computational burden in the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo-based calibration process PBK models. Although several SA algorithms and software packages are available, no comprehensive software package exists that allows users to seamlessly solve differential equations in a PBK model, conduct and visualize SA results, and discriminate between the non-influential model parameters that can be fixed and those that need calibration. Therefore, we developed an R package, named pksensi, to make global SA more accessible in PBK modeling. This package can investigate both uncertainty and sensitivity in PBK models, including those with multivariate model outputs. It also includes functions to check the convergence of the global SA results. Overall, pksensi improves the user experience of performing global SA and can create robust and reproducible results for decision making in PBK model calibration.},

   abstract = {Coming up with Bayesian models for spatial data is easy, but performing inference with them can be challenging. Writing fast inference code for a complex spatial model with realistically-sized datasets from scratch is time-consuming, and if changes are made to the model, there is little guarantee that the code performs well. The key advantages of R-INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations. R-INLA handles latent Gaussian models, where fixed effects, structured and unstructured Gaussian random effects are combined linearly in a linear predictor, and the elements of the linear predictor are observed through one or more likelihoods. The structured random effects can be both standard areal model such as the Besag and the BYM models, and geostatistical models from a subset of the Matérn Gaussian random fields. In this review, we discuss the large success of spatial modeling with R-INLA and the types of spatial models that can be fitted, we give an overview of recent developments for areal models, and we give an overview of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and some of the ways it can be extended beyond the assumptions of isotropy and separability. In particular, we describe how slight changes to the SPDE approach leads to straight-forward approaches for nonstationary spatial models and nonseparable space–time models.

   abstract = {This study examines the progress made by two new reanalyses in the estimation of surface irradiance: ERA5, the new global reanalysis from the ECMWF, and COSMO-REA6, the regional reanalysis from the DWD for Europe. Daily global horizontal irradiance data were evaluated with 41 BSRN stations worldwide, 294 stations in Europe, and two satellite-derived products (NSRDB and SARAH). ERA5 achieves a moderate positive bias worldwide and in Europe of +4.05 W/m2 and +4.54 W/m2 respectively, which entails a reduction in the average bias ranging from 50% to 75% compared to ERA-Interim and MERRA-2. This makes ERA5 comparable with satellite-derived products in terms of the mean bias in most inland stations, but ERA5 results degrade in coastal areas and mountains. The bias of ERA5 varies with the cloudiness, overestimating under cloudy conditions and slightly underestimating under clear-skies, which suggests a poor prediction of cloud patterns and leads to larger absolute errors than that of satellite-based products. In Europe, the regional COSMO-REA6 underestimates in most stations (MBE = −5.29 W/m2) showing the largest deviations under clear-sky conditions, which is most likely caused by the aerosol climatology used. Above 45°N the magnitude of the bias and absolute error of COSMO-REA6 are similar to ERA5 while it outperforms ERA5 in the coastal areas due to its high-resolution grid (6.2 km). We conclude that ERA5 and COSMO-REA6 have reduced the gap between reanalysis and satellite-based data, but further development is required in the prediction of clouds while the spatial grid of ERA5 (31 km) remains inadequate for places with high variability of surface irradiance (coasts and mountains). Satellite-based data should be still used when available, but having in mind their limitations, ERA5 is a valid alternative for situations in which satellite-based data are missing (polar regions and gaps in times series) while COSMO-REA6 complements ERA5 in Central and Northern Europe mitigating the limitations of ERA5 in coastal areas.},

The present study assesses the utility of such a network to improve short-term (i.e., lead times &amp;lt;12 h) National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) forecasts for three parameters most relevant to the energy industry—temperature, dewpoint, and wind speed. A 1-yr sample of 13 AWS sites is chosen to evaluate the magnitude of forecast improvement (skill) and influence of physical location (siting) on such improvements. Hourly predictions are generated using generalized additive modeling (GAM)—a nonlinear statistical equation incorporating a predetermined set of the most significant AWS and NDFD predictors. Two references are used for comparison: (i) persistence climatology (PC) forecasts and (ii) NDFD forecasts calibrated to the AWS sites (CNDFD). The skill, measured via the percent improvement (reduction) in the mean absolute error (MAE), of forecasts generated by the study’s technique (CNDFD+) is comparable (&amp;lt;5%) to PC for lead times of 1–3 h for dewpoint and wind speed. Skill relative to PC slowly increases with lead time, with temperature exhibiting the greatest relative-to-PC skill (∼30% at 12 h). When compared to baseline CNDFD forecasts, the MAE of the generated CNDFD+ forecasts is reduced 65% for temperature and dewpoint at the 1-h lead time. An exponential drop in improvement occurs for longer lead times. Wind speed improvements are notably less, with little skill (&amp;lt;5%) demonstrated for forecasts beyond 4 h. Overall, CNDFD+ forecasts have the greatest accuracy relative to CNDFD and PC for the middle (3–7 h) lead times tested in the study. Variations in CNDFD+ skill exist with respect to AWS location. Tested stations located in complex terrain generally exhibit greater skill relative to CNDFD than the 13-station average for temperature (and, to a lesser degree, dewpoint). Relative to PC, however, the same subset of stations exhibits skill below the 13-station average. No conclusive relationship can be made between CNDFD+ skill and the sample stations located near water.</p>},

   abstract = {Spatial climate datasets of 1981-2010 long-term mean monthly average dew point and minimum and maximum vapor pressure deficit were developed for the conterminous United States at 30-Arcsec (~800m) resolution. Interpolation of long-term averages (twelve monthly values per variable) was performed using PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model). Surface stations available for analysis numbered only 4,000 for dew point and 3,500 for vapor pressure deficit, compared to 16,000 for previouslydeveloped grids of 1981-2010 long-term mean monthly minimum and maximum temperature. Therefore, a form of Climatologically-Aided Interpolation (CAI) was used, in which the 1981-2010 temperature grids were used as predictor grids. For each grid cell, PRISM calculated a local regression function between the interpolated climate variable and the predictor grid. Nearby stations entering the regression were assigned weights based on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell that included the effects of distance, elevation, coastal proximity, vertical atmospheric layer, and topographic position. Interpolation uncertainties were estimated using cross-validation exercises. Given that CAI interpolation was used, a new method was developed to allow uncertainties in predictor grids to be accounted for in estimating the total interpolation error. Local land use/land cover properties had noticeable effects on the spatial patterns of atmospheric moisture content and deficit. An example of this was relatively high dew points and low vapor pressure deficits at stations located in or near irrigated fields. The new grids, in combination with existing temperature grids, enable the user to derive a full suite of atmospheric moisture variables, such as minimum and maximum relative humidity, vapor pressure, and dew point depression, with accompanying assumptions. All of these grids are available online at http://prism. oregonstate.edu, and include 800-m and 4-km resolution data, images, metadata, pedigree information, and station inventory files.},

   abstract = {Air temperature has been the most commonly used exposure metric in assessing relationships between thermal stress and mortality. Lack of the high-quality meteorological station data necessary to adequately characterize the thermal environment has been one of the main limitations for the use of more complex thermal indices. Global climate reanalyses may provide an ideal platform to overcome this limitation and define complex heat and cold stress conditions anywhere in the world. In this study, we explored the potential of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) based on ERA5 – the latest global climate reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) – as a health-related tool. Employing a novel ERA5-based thermal comfort dataset ERA5-HEAT, we investigated the relationships between the UTCI and daily mortality data in 21 cities across 9 European countries. We used distributed lag nonlinear models to assess exposure-response relationships between mortality and thermal conditions in individual cities. We then employed meta-regression models to pool the results for each city into four groups according to climate zone. To evaluate the performance of ERA5-based UTCI, we compared its effects on mortality with those for the station-based UTCI data. In order to assess the additional effect of the UTCI, the performance of ERA5-and station-based air temperature (T) was evaluated. Whilst generally similar heat- and cold-effects were observed for the ERA5-and station-based data in most locations, the important role of wind in the UTCI appeared in the results. The largest difference between any two datasets was found in the Southern European group of cities, where the relative risk of mortality at the 1st percentile of daily mean temperature distribution (1.29 and 1.30 according to the ERA5 vs station data, respectively) considerably exceeded the one for the daily mean UTCI (1.19 vs 1.22). These differences were mainly due to the effect of wind in the cold tail of the UTCI distribution. The comparison of exposure-response relationships between ERA5-and station-based data shows that ERA5-based UTCI may be a useful tool for definition of life-threatening thermal conditions in locations where high-quality station data are not available.},

   abstract = {Wildland fire managers in the United States currently utilize the gridded forecasts from the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) to make fire behavior predictions across complex landscapes during large wildfires. However, little is known about the NDFDs performance in remote locations with complex topography for weather variables important for fire behavior prediction, including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this study NDFD forecasts for calendar year 2015 were evaluated in fire-prone locations across the conterminous United States during periods with the potential for active fire spread using the model performance statistics of root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean fractional bias (MFB), and mean bias error (MBE). Results indicated that NDFD forecasts of air temperature and relative humidity performed well with RMSEs of about 2°C and 10%-11%, respectively. However, wind speed was increasingly underpredicted when observed wind speeds exceeded about 4 m s-1, with MFB and MBE values of approximately -15% and -0.5 m s-1, respectively. The importance of accurate wind speed forecasts in terms of fire behavior prediction was confirmed, and the forecast accuracies needed to achieve "good" surface head fire rate-of-spread predictions were estimated as ± 20%-30% of the observed wind speed. Weather station location, the specific forecast office, and terrain complexity had the largest impacts on wind speed forecast error, although the relatively low variance explained by the model (~37%) suggests that other variables are likely to be important. Based on these results it is suggested that wildland fire managers should use caution when utilizing the NDFD wind speed forecasts if high wind speed events are anticipated.},

   abstract = {Exposure to excessive heat is associated with a higher risk of death. Although the relative risk of death on extreme-heat days has decreased over the past several decades in the United States, the drivers of this decline have not been fully characterized. In particular, while extreme heat earlier in the warm season has been shown to confer greater risk of mortality than exposure later in the season, it is unknown whether this within-season variability in susceptibility has changed over time and whether it is modified by region, climatic changes, or social vulnerability. Methods We used distributed-lag nonlinear models and meta-regression to estimate the association between ambient maximum daily temperature during the early, late, and overall warm seasons and the relative risk of mortality for two decades, 1973-1982 and 1997-2006, in 186 metropolitan areas in the United States. We assessed changes in relative risk nationally, regionally, and between places with differential changes in early-season relative extreme heat and indicators of social vulnerability. Results Most of the reduction in heat-related mortality nationally between the two decades is driven by decreases in late-season mortality, while substantial early-season risk remains. This difference is most apparent in the Northeast, in cities with greater increases in early-season relative extreme heat, and in places that have become more socially vulnerable. Conclusions Early-season heat mortality risks have persisted despite overall adaptations, particularly in places with greater warming and increasing social vulnerability. Interventions to reduce heat mortality may need to consider greater applicability to the early warm season.},

Coral restoration is needed to rehabilitate degraded reefs and to sustain biodiversity. There is a need for baseline data on global reef distribution, composition, and condition to provide targets for conservation and restoration. Remote sensing can address this issue and is currently underutilized in reef research and restoration. This synthesis integrates current capabilities of remote sensing with key reef restoration criteria, to facilitate coral restoration success. Research into the development of a spectral database for corals, linking habitat type and extent with predator abundance, and identification of species-specific acoustic signatures are needed to advance the use of remote sensing in reef restoration design and monitoring. Reciprocally, reef restoration efforts should innovate at ecosystem, regional, and global levels using remote sensing, to preserve as much of the coral reef biome as possible with continued ocean-climate change.},

This paper illustrates how the principles of case-crossover design are related to the principles of crossover and case-control designs and stipulates the possibilities of case-crossover design in air pollution epidemiology. In the case-crossover design, the study population consists of subjects who have experienced an episode of the health outcome of interest. Similar to a crossover study, each subject serves as his or her own control. As in a matched case-control study, the inference is based on a comparison of exposure distribution rather than the risk of disease. The case-crossover study is most suitable for studying relations with the following characteristics: 1) the individual exposure varies within short time intervals; 2) the disease has abrupt onset and short latency for detection; and 3) the induction period is short. Case-crossover design allows use of routinely monitored air pollution information and at the same time makes it possible to study individuals rather than days as the unit of observation. Case-crossover design is amenable for studying the effects of varying short-term air pollution exposure on health outcomes with an abrupt onset, such as myocardial infarction or asthma attack.},

This design can be an alternative to Poisson time series regression for studying the health effects of fine particulate matter air pollution. Characteristics of time-series of particulate matter, including long-term time trends, seasonal trends, and short-term autocorrelations, require that referent selection in the case-crossover design be considered carefully and adapted to minimize bias. We performed simulations to evaluate the bias associated with various referent selection strategies for a proposed case-crossover study of associations between particulate matter and primary cardiac arrest. Some a priori reasonable strategies were associated with a relative bias as large as 10%, but for most strategies the relative bias was less than 2% with confidence interval coverage within 1% of the nominal level. We show that referent selection for case-crossover designs raises the same issues as selection of smoothing method for time series analyses. In addition, conditional logistic regression analysis is not strictly valid for some case-crossover designs, introducing further bias.},

   abstract = {Although most patients with epilepsy have normal cognitive abilities, they are at increased risk for cognitive deficits. Multiple factors contribute to this risk including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), which not only reduce neuronal irritability but may also impair neuronal excitability. The major cognitive effects of AEDs are impaired attention, vigilance, and psychomotor speed, but secondary effects on other cognitive functions can be seen. The adverse cognitive effects of AEDs are offset in part by reduced seizures. In general, the cognitive effects of AEDs are less than the sum total of other factors, but because AEDs are the major therapeutic modality for epilepsy, they are of special concern. AED-induced cognitive side effects are increased with rapid initiation, higher dosages, and polytherapy. Differential cognitive effects can be seen (e.g., worse performance on phenobarbital), but the magnitude of cognitive effects is relatively modest effects for most AEDs. However, even this modest effect can be clinically significant and impact the patient's quality of life. In addition, some patient groups may be at particular risk (e.g., elderly, children, fetus). The ultimate therapeutic goal is to control seizures with no or minimal side effects. The cognitive profile of an AED is but one factor in the selection of therapeutic options. Ongoing seizures can be detrimental to both cognition and quality of life. Patients who are refractory or intolerant to AED therapy should be referred for video EEG monitoring to confirm the seizure diagnosis and determine if the patient is a candidate for epilepsy surgery.},

Ambient particles may also trigger acute decompensation in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), but this hypothesis has not been evaluated in a systematic manner. This study evaluated the association between daily levels of respirable particulate matter of aerodynamic diameters ≤10 μm (PM10) and the rate of hospitalization from the emergency room for CHF in Medicare recipients (age ≥65 years) in 7 United States cities from 1986 and 1999. The time-stratified case-crossover design was used to separately estimate the effect of a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 in each city. A combined random-effects estimate was then obtained from the city-specific effect estimates. There were 292,918 admissions with primary diagnoses of CHF during the observation period. Overall, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 0.72% (95% confidence interval 0.35% to 1.10%) increase in the rate of admission for CHF on the same day. The effect of PM10 appeared to be less in patients with secondary diagnoses of hypertension. There was no consistent effect modification by age, gender, race, or any other secondary diagnosis evaluated. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that elevated levels of particulate air pollution, below the current limits set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, are associated with an increase in the rate of hospital admission for exacerbation of CHF.},

   abstract = {Introduction In the recent past, spells of extreme heat associated with appreciable mortality have been documented in developed countries, including North America and Europe. However, far fewer research reports are available from developing countries or specific cities in South Asia. In May 2010, Ahmedabad, India, faced a heat wave where the temperatures reached a high of 46.8°C with an apparent increase in mortality. The purpose of this study is to characterize the heat wave impact and assess the associated excess mortality.  Methods We conducted an analysis of all-cause mortality associated with a May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, to determine whether extreme heat leads to excess mortality. Counts of all-cause deaths from May 1–31, 2010 were compared with the mean of counts from temporally matched periods in May 2009 and 2011 to calculate excess mortality. Other analyses included a 7-day moving average, mortality rate ratio analysis, and relationship between daily maximum temperature and daily all-cause death counts over the entire year of 2010, using month-wise correlations.  Results The May 2010 heat wave was associated with significant excess all-cause mortality. 4,462 all-cause deaths occurred, comprising an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths, an estimated 43.1% increase when compared to the reference period (3,118 deaths). In monthly pair-wise comparisons for 2010, we found high correlations between mortality and daily maximum temperature during the locally hottest “summer” months of April (r = 0.69, p<0.001), May (r = 0.77, p<0.001), and June (r = 0.39, p<0.05). During a period of more intense heat (May 19–25, 2010), mortality rate ratios were 1.76 [95% CI 1.67–1.83, p<0.001] and 2.12 [95% CI 2.03–2.21] applying reference periods (May 12–18, 2010) from various years.  Conclusion The May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India had a substantial effect on all-cause excess mortality, even in this city where hot temperatures prevail through much of April-June.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Days of extreme temperature may be associated with transiently higher risk of preterm birth, but prior studies have been limited and results have been heterogeneous. 

OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the association between days of extreme heat and cold and risk of preterm birth among ~32 million live singleton births between 1989 and 2002 across 403 counties in the contiguous United States (US). 

METHODS
We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between population-weighted daily mean temperature and risk of preterm birth in each county and then pooled results across geographic regions and climate zones. We defined extreme heat and cold as the 95th and 5th percentile of the county-specific temperatures, respectively. 

RESULTS
Preterm birth accounted for 9.3% of deliveries. There was a monotonic association between ambient temperature and risk of preterm birth. Days of extreme heat and cold were associated with a relative risk of preterm birth of 1.025 (95% CI: 1.015, 1.036) and 0.985 (95% CI: 0.976, 0.993) over the subsequent four days, respectively, relative to the county-specific median temperature. If causal, the fraction of preterm births attributable to extreme heat was 0.17% (empirical 95% CI: 0.14%, 0.19%), corresponding to 154 (empirical 95% CI: 127, 173) preterm births per million births. Extreme heat was more strongly associated with preterm birth in regions with colder and drier climates, and among younger women. Days of extreme cold temperature were associated with lower rather than higher risk of preterm birth. 

CONCLUSIONS
Days of extreme heat, but not extreme cold, are associated with higher risk of preterm birth in the contiguous US. If causal, these results may have important implications for the management of pregnant women during forecasted periods of extreme heat.},

A total of 10,026 study subjects residing in Jefferson County, Alabama were georeferenced using both street centerline and residential parcel methods. The mean nondirectional, linear distance between points georeferenced using both methods was 246 ft with a range of 11 to 13,260 ft.

   abstract = {Until recently, little attention has been paid to geocoding positional accuracy and its impacts on accessibility measures; estimates of disease rates; findings of disease clustering; spatial prediction and modeling of health outcomes; and estimates of individual exposures based on geographic proximity to pollutant and pathogen sources. It is now clear that positional errors can result in flawed findings and poor public health decisions. Yet the current state-of-practice is to ignore geocoding positional uncertainty, primarily because of a lack of theory, methods and tools for quantifying, modeling, and adjusting for geocoding positional errors in health analysis.This paper proposes a research agenda to address this need. It summarizes the basics of the geocoding process, its assumptions, and empirical evidence describing the magnitude of geocoding positional error. An overview of the impacts of positional error in health analysis, including accessibility, disease clustering, exposure reconstruction, and spatial weights estimation is presented. The proposed research agenda addresses five key needs: (1) a lack of standardized, open-access geocoding resources for use in health research; (2) a lack of geocoding validation datasets that will allow the evaluation of alternative geocoding engines and procedures; (3) a lack of spatially explicit geocoding positional error models; (4) a lack of resources for assessing the sensitivity of spatial analysis results to geocoding positional error; (5) a lack of demonstration studies that illustrate the sensitivity of health policy decisions to geocoding positional error. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Research on heatwaves has gained significant impetus over the past decade due to a warming planet and rapid 21st century urbanization. This study examines driving factors influencing heatwave trends and interannual variability across Southern California (SoCal) from 1950–2020. Inland urban areas of Los Angeles county are the most susceptible to heatwaves with strong increasing trends in frequency, duration, and intensity that are closely tied to nighttime warming. Coastal and rural areas are less impacted but show a significant increase in heatwave frequency over the past two decades. Heatwave nighttime temperatures combined with high humidity have been increasing at a rapid rate of ~1°C/decade since the 1980s—elevating heat stress and mortality risk to vulnerable urban communities. The increased nighttime humidity is associated with an anomalous moisture source off the coast of Baja California that has intensified over the past decade and is linked to ocean warming trends and changes in the California current system. Heatwaves are starting earlier and ending later in the year for urban regions. This augments public health risks and sets the stage for more intense fall wildfires by enhancing the drying of fuels. Droughts and heatwaves are strongly linked, particularly in inland urban and rural areas that have a high statistical probability of heatwaves increasing in frequency (42%), duration (26%), and daily mean temperature (2.2%) during severe drought conditions. Better understanding of heatwave climate drivers and underlying physical processes could help with prediction skill, in addition to providing effective data-driven recommendations for mitigation efforts in SoCal's vulnerable urban regions.},

Geographic information systems (GIS) are a collection of tools that can aid the social economist in the investigation of such phenomena. Geocoding is a technical procedure that matches attribute data to spatial features in GIS. This analysis of social economy discusses the possibilities of spatial analysis and the technical process of geocoding. Using 15 years of address level pediatric data from a local children's hospital, a novel iterative geocoding process is applied for the purpose of investigating the relationship between household environments and health outcomes. This procedure adheres to traditional standards for geocoding (positional accuracy, completeness, and repeat-ability) while producing multiple spatial data sets that can be associated with a range of environmental and socioeconomic variables related to human health. Describing this technical procedure contributes to a growing methodological toolbox for applying GIS to research in social economics.},

   abstract = {The widespread availability of powerful geocoding tools in commercial GIS software and the interest in spatial analysis at the individual level have made address geocoding a widely employed technique in many different fields. The most commonly used approach to geocoding employs a street network data model, in which addresses are placed along a street segment based on a linear interpolation of the location of the street number within an address range. Several alternatives have emerged, including the use of address points and parcels, but these have not received widespread attention in the literature. This paper reviews the foundation of geocoding and presents a framework for evaluating geocoding quality based on completeness, positional accuracy and repeatability. Geocoding quality was compared using three address data models: address points, parcels and street networks. The empirical evaluation employed a variety of different address databases for three different Counties in Florida. Results indicate that address point geocoding produces geocoding match rates similar to those observed for street network geocoding. Parcel geocoding generally produces much lower match rates, in particular for commercial and multi-family residential addresses. Variability in geocoding match rates between address databases and between geographic areas is substantial, reinforcing the need to strengthen the development of standards for address reference data and improved address data entry validation procedures.},

   abstract = {The concept of big data, commonly characterized by volume, variety, velocity, and veracity, goes far beyond the data type and includes the aspects of data analysis, such as hypothesis-generating, rather than hypothesis-testing. Big data focuses on temporal stability of the association, rather than on causal relationship and underlying probability distribution assumptions are frequently not required. Medical big data as material to be analyzed has various features that are not only distinct from big data of other disciplines, but also distinct from traditional clinical epidemiology. Big data technology has many areas of application in healthcare, such as predictive modeling and clinical decision support, disease or safety surveillance, public health, and research. Big data analytics frequently exploits analytic methods developed in data mining, including classification, clustering, and regression. Medical big data analyses are complicated by many technical issues, such as missing values, curse of dimensionality, and bias control, and share the inherent limitations of observation study, namely the inability to test causality resulting from residual confounding and reverse causation. Recently, propensity score analysis and instrumental variable analysis have been introduced to overcome these limitations, and they have accomplished a great deal. Many challenges, such as the absence of evidence of practical benefits of big data, methodological issues including legal and ethical issues, and clinical integration and utility issues, must be overcome to realize the promise of medical big data as the fuel of a continuous learning healthcare system that will improve patient outcome and reduce waste in areas including nephrology.},

Combining GPS and GIS allows for advances in environmental exposure assessment.

A solution may be to integrate the Public health / Nutrition approach and the Transportation approach to GPS studies, so as to combine a GPS and accelerometer data collection with an electronic mobility survey. Correcting exposure measures and improving study designs with this approach may permit mitigating biases related to selective daily mobility.},

The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications. The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients. We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species and vegetation distribution modeling.

This study examines the geography, timing, and meteorological conditions present during the onset of hyperthermia, using the most complete dataset available. Deaths are concentrated in the eastern quadrant of the United States and are most common during August. Over half the deaths occurred during morning practices when high humidity levels were common. The athletes were typically large (79% with a body mass index >30) and mostly (86%) played linemen positions. Meteorological conditions were atypically hot and humid by local standards on most days with fatalities. Further, all deaths occurred under conditions defined as high or extreme by the American College of Sports Medicine using the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), but under lower threat levels using the heat index (HI). Football-specific thresholds based on clothing (full football uniform, practice uniform, or shorts) were also examined. The thresholds matched well with data from athletes wearing practice uniforms but poorly for those in shorts only. Too few cases of athletes in full pads were available to draw any broad conclusions. We recommend that coaches carefully monitor players, particularly large linemen, early in the pre-season on days with wet bulb globe temperatures that are categorized as high or extreme. Also, as most of the deaths were among young athletes, longer acclimatization periods may be needed.},

   abstract = {Spatially targeted interventions may help protect the public when extreme heat occurs. Health outcome data are increasingly being used to map intra-urban variability in heat-health risks, but there has been little effort to compare patterns and risk factors between cities. We sought to identify places within large metropolitan areas where the mortality rate is highest on hot summer days and determine if characteristics of high-risk areas are consistent from one city to another. A Poisson regression model was adapted to quantify temperature–mortality relationships at the postal code scale based on 2.1 million records of daily all-cause mortality counts from seven U.S. cities. Multivariate spatial regression models were then used to determine the demographic and environmental variables most closely associated with intra-city variability in risk. Significant mortality increases on extreme heat days were confined to 12–44% of postal codes comprising each city. Places with greater risk had more developed land, young, elderly, and minority residents, and lower income and educational attainment, but the key explanatory variables varied from one city to another. Regression models accounted for 14–34% of the spatial variability in heat-related mortality. The results emphasize the need for public health plans for heat to be locally tailored and not assume that pre-identified vulnerability indicators are universally applicable. As known risk factors accounted for no more than one third of the spatial variability in heat–health outcomes, consideration of health outcome data is important in efforts to identify and protect residents of the places where the heat-related health risks are the highest.},

Meteorological measurements were taken in three climatic zones (hot/wet, hot/dry, and extremely hot/dry) for 60 days, and a new stress index based on these databases was developed as follows: ESI = 0.63Ta - 0.03RH + 0.002SR + 0.0054(Ta·RH) - 0.073(0.1 + SR)-1. where Ta is the ambient temperature (°C), RH the relative humidity (%), and SR the solar radiation (W·m-1).

Building on these efforts, we apply data from a variety of sources to calculate WBGT, understand the accuracy of our estimated equation, and compare the performance of different sources of input data. To do this, WBGT measurements were collected from Kestrel 5400 Heat Stress Trackers installed in three locations in Alabama. Data were also drawn from local weather stations, North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), and low cost iButton hygrometers. We applied previously published equations for estimating natural wet bulb temperature, globe temperature, and WBGT to these diverse data sources. Correlation results showed that WBGT estimates derived from all proxy data sources—weather station, weather station/iButton, NLDAS, NLDAS/iButton—were statistically indistinguishable from each other, or from the Kestrel measurements, at two of the three sites. However, at the same two sites, the addition of iButtons significantly reduced root mean square error and bias compared to other methods.},

   abstract = {There is near unanimous scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity will change Earth's climate. The recent (globally averaged) warming by 0·5°C is partly attributable to such anthropogenic emissions. Climate change will affect human health in many ways—mostly adversely. Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.},

The prevention of deaths in the community caused by extreme high temperatures (heat waves) is now an issue of public health concern. The risk of heat-related mortality increases with natural aging, but persons with particular social and/or physical vulnerability are also at risk. Important differences in vulnerability exist between populations, depending on climate, culture, infrastructure (housing), and other factors. Public health measures include health promotion and heat wave warning systems, but the effectiveness of acute measures in response to heat waves has not yet been formally evaluated. Climate change will increase the frequency and the intensity of heat waves, and a range of measures, including improvements to housing, management of chronic diseases, and institutional care of the elderly and the vulnerable, will need to be developed to reduce health impacts.</p>},

These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm's way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth's energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now.</p>},

   abstract = {Increasingly commonplace in cities, extreme heat events introduce multi-stress vulnerability, affecting people's health and well-being, financial situation, mobility, social relations, and access to basic services. Planning to reduce heat vulnerability has become part of government business and to some extent community-level responses, cutting across a number of sectors including public health, emergency management, social services, critical infrastructure, and housing. This planning is often framed around heat as an emergency, focusing on preventing loss of life and severe health impacts, yet a vulnerability perspective also draws attention to the chronic and persistent impacts of heat. Our research, based on interviews and desktop research in Melbourne, Australia, found tensions between addressing heat as an emergency and heat as a source of chronic stress, with emergency responses taking precedence over responses addressing the chronic dimensions of heat. Each approach results in different but nonetheless related programmatic priorities for reducing vulnerability. In complex institutional settings, improving relations between policy and programme managers, non-government organisations, and vulnerable people themselves would enable the multiple stresses associated with extreme heat to be more effectively addressed. Policy and institutional responses that better appreciate the interconnections between the emergency and chronic aspects of heat would likely reduce vulnerability and contribute to more just approaches to urban sustainability.

   abstract = {Heat wave warning systems and related research define heat waves using various indices and there exists no standard definition for a heat wave. Despite various weather forecast services for heat stress in South Korea, it is unclear how different thermal indices affect the designation of heat waves and health effect estimates. We aimed to analyze trends of heat wave characteristics and mortality associations using various criteria for the warm season (June-September) in 2011–5 for the most populated two cities in South Korea, Seoul and Busan. Hourly weather monitoring data and daily mortality data in each city were obtained. The following indices were estimated to define heat waves: air temperature, heat index (HI), humidex, apparent temperature (AT), effective temperature (ET), and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). The thresholds of each index for heat wave definitions were obtained by statistical distribution (95th percentiles) and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Thermal indices showed clustering of accumulation of excess heat above thresholds for northeast regions in the cities while air temperature showed it for central regions. Compared to 95th percentiles, the MMTs resulted 14 times longer heat wave days for thermal indices except for air temperature. When MMTs were used, nine times larger excess mortality from heat waves occurred for all indices compared to that from heat waves defined by the 95th percentiles. The thermal indices with the highest association between heat and mortality varied between the two cities: air temperature for Seoul and WBGT for Busan. Heat wave warnings should be based on a thorough comparison of how different heat wave criteria will affect the public health impact of heat wave warnings in terms of identifying a heat wave and degree of health impacts due to it.},

   abstract = {Background: With a warming climate, it is important to identify sub-populations at risk of harm during extreme heat. Several international studies have reported that individuals from ethnic minorities are at increased risk of heat-related illness, for reasons that are not often discussed. Objective: The aim of this article is to investigate the underpinning reasons as to why ethnicity may be associated with susceptibility to extreme heat, and how this may be relevant to Australia's population. Design: Drawing upon literary sources, the authors provide commentary on this important, yet poorly understood area of heat research. Results: Social and economic disparities, living conditions, language barriers, and occupational exposure are among the many factors contributing to heat-susceptibility among minority ethnic groups in the United States. However, there is a knowledge gap about socio-cultural influences on vulnerability in other countries. Conclusion: More research needs to be undertaken to determine the effects of heat on tourists, migrants, and refugees who are confronted with a different climatic environment. Thorough epidemiological investigations of the association between ethnicity and heat-related health outcomes are required, and this could be assisted with better reporting of nationality data in health statistics. Climate change adaptation strategies in Australia and elsewhere need to be ethnically inclusive and cognisant of an upward trend in the proportion of the population who are migrants and refugees.},

   abstract = {SYNOPSIS Objectives. Racial/ethnic disparities in health in the U.S. have been well described. The field of "cultural competence" has emerged as one strategy to address these disparities. Based on a review of the relevant literature, the authors develop a definition of cultural competence, identify key components for intervention, and describe a practical framework for implementation of measures to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. Methods. The authors conducted a literature review of academic, foundation, and government publications focusing on sociocultural barriers to care, the level of the health care system at which a given barrier occurs, and cultural competence efforts that address these barriers. Results. Sociocultural barriers to care were identified at the organizational (leadership/workforce), structural (processes of care), and clinical (provider-patient encounter) levels. A framework of cultural competence interventions-including minority recruitment into the health professions, development of interpreter services and language-appropriate health educational materials, and provider education on cross-cultural issues-emerged to categorize strategies to address racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. Conclusions. Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of addressing racial/ethnic disparities in health and health care. A framework of organizational, structural, and clinical cultural competence interventions can facilitate the elimination of these disparities and improve care for all Americans.},

   abstract = {Background Prior research shows that work in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations increases the risk of environmental heat-associated death.  Purpose To assess the risk of environmental heat-associated death by occupation.  Methods This was a case-control study. Cases were heat-caused and heat-related deaths occurring from May-October during the period 2002–2009 in Maricopa County, Arizona. Controls were selected at random from non-heat-associated deaths during the same period in Maricopa County. Information on occupation, age, sex, and race-ethnicity was obtained from death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios for heat-associated death.  Results There were 444 cases of heat-associated deaths in adults (18+ years) and 925 adult controls. Of heat-associated deaths, 332 (75%) occurred in men; a construction/extraction or agriculture occupation was described on the death certificate in 115 (35%) of these men. In men, the age-adjusted odds ratios for heat-associated death were 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.55, 3.48) in association with construction/extraction and 3.50 (95% confidence interval 1.94, 6.32) in association with agriculture occupations. The odds ratio for heat-associated death was 10.17 (95% confidence interval 5.38, 19.23) in men with unknown occupation. In women, the age-adjusted odds ratio for heat-associated death was 6.32 (95% confidence interval 1.48, 27.08) in association with unknown occupation. Men age 65 years and older in agriculture occupations were at especially high risk of heat-associated death.  Conclusion The occurrence of environmental heat-associated death in men in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations in a setting with predictable periods of high summer temperatures presents opportunities for prevention.},

   abstract = {Local zoning codes affect a broad range of policies. For example, they can constrain housing supply and create affordability challenges (Ikeda and Washington 2015; Glaeser and Ward 2006), contribute to housing segregation (Greene at al. 2017; Pendall 2000), and determine how well a jurisdiction responds to changes in demographics and climate (Micklow and Warner 2014; Nolon 2013). Despite the importance of local zoning regulations, research that measures the restrictiveness of zoning laws across places and the impact of restrictive zoning across a range of outcomes is remarkably thin. One reason is that zoning codes are long, technical, and difficult to access. Consequently, there is no up-to-date national dataset or reliable standard practice used to compare zoning codes. To address this gap, we explore whether it is possible to merge property assessment records with granular data on zoning policies to generate a model that "predicts" zoning regulations. Using such a model, we could build an accurate, publicly accessible dataset of zoning regulations across the US. In this paper, we test this hypothesis with a proof of concept in Washington, DC. We combine property assessment records provided by Zillow (ZTRAX) with data from the Washington, DC, Office of Zoning, and using a random forest regression, predict zoning characteristics in zones with residences. We find that we are able to use property records to predict density limits with a relatively high degree of accuracy. Our model itself is exploratory and has many limitations: it uses a relatively small set of zones and depends greatly on how properties with missing zone designations are assigned to zones. Additionally, model predictions are largely directional, and vary in accuracy by zone type. We focus on one variable in the zoning code-density limits-and one city-Washington, DC-and thus more work is needed to determine whether the model can generalize to different jurisdictions and zoning regulations. Yet, preliminary directional success suggests that pursuing this work at a larger scale would be fruitful, and it would offer significant benefit to researchers seeking to study the effects of zoning across a wide array of policy domains.},

   abstract = {Excess mortality not directly related to the virus has been shown to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in heat-related mortality during the pandemic have not been addressed in detail. Here, we performed an observational study crossing daily mortality data collected in Portugal (SICO/DGS) with high-resolution temperature series (ERA5/ECMWF), characterizing their relation in the pre-pandemic, and how it aggravated during 2020. The combined result of COVID-19 and extreme temperatures caused the largest annual mortality burden in recent decades (~ 12 000 excess deaths [~ 11% above baseline]). COVID-19 caused the largest fraction of excess mortality during March to May (62%) and from October onwards (85%). During summer, its direct impact was residual, and deaths not reported as COVID-19 dominated excess mortality (553 versus 3 968). A prolonged hot spell led mortality to the upper tertile, reaching its peak in mid-July (+ 45% deaths/day). The lethality ratio (+ 14 deaths per cumulated ºC) was higher than that observed in recent heatwaves. We used a statistical model to estimate expected deaths due to cold/heat, indicating an amplification of at least 50% in heat-related deaths during 2020 compared to pre-pandemic years. Our findings suggest mortality during 2020 has been indirectly amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the disruption of healthcare systems and fear of population in attending healthcare facilities (expressed in emergency room admissions decreases). While lockdown measures and healthcare systems reorganization prevented deaths directly related to the virus, a significant burden due to other causes represents a strong secondary impact. This was particularly relevant during summer hot spells, when the lethality ratio reached magnitudes not experienced since the 2003 heatwaves. This severe amplification of heat-related mortality during 2020 stresses the need to resume normal healthcare services and public health awareness.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Although previous literature suggested that several factors may be associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes related to heat, research is limited for birth outcomes. 

OBJECTIVES
We investigated associations between exposure to heat/heat waves during the last week of gestation and preterm birth (PTB) in North Carolina (NC) and evaluated effect modification by residential greenness, urbanicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). 

METHODS
We obtained individual-level NC birth certificate data for May–September 2003–2014. We estimated daily mean temperature at each maternal residential address using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data. We created 3 definitions of heat waves (daily temperature ≥95th, 97th, 99th percentile for NC warm season temperature, for ≥2 consecutive days). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to assess residential greenness. Community-level modifiers (e.g., income, urbanicity) were considered. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between exposure to heat/heat waves and PTB, controlling for covariates. Stratified analyses were conducted to evaluate whether the association between heat and PTB varied by several individual and community characteristics. 

RESULTS
Of the 546,441 births, 8% were preterm. Heat exposure during the last week before delivery was significantly associated with risk of PTB. The hazard ratio for a 1 °C increase in temperature during the last week before delivery was 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02). Higher heat-PTB risk was associated with some characteristics (e.g., areas that were urbanized, low SES, or in the Coastal Plain). We also found significant PTB-heat risk in areas with low greenness for urbanized area. For heat waves, we did not find significantly positive associations with PTB. 

DISCUSSION
Findings provide evidence that exposure to heat during pregnancy increases risk of PTB and suggest disparities in these risks. Our results have implications for future studies of disparity in heat and birth outcomes associations.},

Climate change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events, resulting in many additional heat-related deaths globally, as well as changing the nature of extreme cold events. At the same time, vulnerability to extreme heat has decreased over time, probably due to a combination of physiological, behavioural, infrastructural, and technological adaptations. We aimed to account for these changes in vulnerability and avoid overstated projections for temperature-related mortality. We used the historical observed decrease in vulnerability to improve future mortality estimates. Methods: We used historical mortality and temperature data from 208 US cities to quantify how observed changes in vulnerability from 1973 to 2013 affected projections of temperature-related mortality under various climate scenarios. We used geographically structured meta-regression to characterise the relationship between temperature and mortality for these urban populations over the specified time period. We then used the fitted relationships to project mortality under future climate conditions. Findings: Between Oct 26, 2018, and March 9, 2020, we established that differences in vulnerability to temperature were geographically structured. Vulnerability decreased over time in most areas. US mortalities projected from a 2°C increase in mean temperature decreased by more than 97% when using 2003–13 data compared with 1973–82 data. However, these benefits declined with increasing temperatures, with a 6°C increase showing only an 84% decline in projected mortality based on 2003–13 data. Interpretation: Even after accounting for adaptation, the projected effects of climate change on premature mortality constitute a substantial public health risk. Our work suggests large increases in temperature will require additional mitigation to avoid excess mortality from heat events, even in areas with high air conditioning coverage in place.

   abstract = {<p>Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as “knowledge engines” in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality—especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.</p>},

   abstract = {Motivation: Modern data acquisition based on high-throughput technology is often facing the problem of missing data. Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable types. We propose a non-parametric method which can cope with different types of variables simultaneously.Results: We compare several state of the art methods for the imputation of missing values. We propose and evaluate an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on a random forest. By averaging over many unpruned classification or regression trees, random forest intrinsically constitutes a multiple imputation scheme. Using the built-in out-of-bag error estimates of random forest, we are able to estimate the imputation error without the need of a test set. Evaluation is performed on multiple datasets coming from a diverse selection of biological fields with artificially introduced missing values ranging from 10% to 30%. We show that missForest can successfully handle missing values, particularly in datasets including different types of variables. In our comparative study, missForest outperforms other methods of imputation especially in data settings where complex interactions and non-linear relations are suspected. The out-of-bag imputation error estimates of missForest prove to be adequate in all settings. Additionally, missForest exhibits attractive computational efficiency and can cope with high-dimensional data. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood chemicals are routinely measured in clinical or preclinical research studies to diagnose diseases, assess risks in epidemiological research, or use metabolomic phenotyping in response to treatments. A vast volume of blood-related literature is available via the PubMed database for data mining. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to generate a comprehensive blood exposome database of endogenous and exogenous chemicals associated with the mammalian circulating system through text mining and database fusion. METHODS: Using NCBI resources, we retrieved PubMed abstracts, PubChem chemical synonyms, and PMC supplementary tables. We then employed text mining and PubChem crowdsourcing to associate phrases relating to blood with PubChem chemicals. False positives were removed by a phrase pattern and a compound exclusion list. RESULTS: A query to identify blood-related publications in the PubMed database yielded 1.1 million papers. Matching a total of 15 million synonyms from 6.5 million relevant PubChem chemicals against all blood-related publications yielded 37,514 chemicals and 851,999 publications records. Mapping PubChem compound identifiers to the PubMed database yielded 49,940 unique chemicals linked to 676,643 papers. Analysis of open-access metabolomics papers related to blood phrases in the PMC database yielded 4,039 unique compounds and 204 papers. Consolidating these three approaches summed up to a total of 41,474 achiral structures that were linked to 65,957 PubChem CIDs and to over 878,966 PubMed articles. We mapped these compounds to 50 databases such as those covering metabolites and pathways, governmental and toxicological databases, pharmacology resources, and bioassay repositories. In comparison, HMDB, the Human Metabolome Database, links 1,075 compounds to blood-related primary publications. CONCLUSION: This new Blood Exposome Database can be used for prioritizing chemicals for systematic reviews, developing target assays in exposome research, identifying compounds in untargeted mass spectrometry, and biological interpretation in metabolomics data. The database is available at http://bloodexposome.org. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4713.},

We examined these responses in unacclimatized, physically active, older individuals with (n = 13, mean ± SD age: 60 ± 8 years, HbA1c: 7.0 ± 1.0%) and without (Control, n = 30, 62 ± 6 years) well-controlled T2D during a brief, 3-h passive exposure to extreme heat (44°C, 30% relative humidity). Metabolic heat production, dry heat gain, total heat gain (metabolic heat production + dry heat gain), evaporative heat loss, body heat storage (summation of heat gain/loss), rectal and mean skin temperatures as well as heart rate were measured continuously. No between-group differences were observed for metabolic heat production (T2D vs. Control; 53 ± 5 vs. 55 ± 7 W/m2), dry heat gain (48 ± 9 vs. 47 ± 11 W/m2), total heat gain (101 ± 10 vs. 102 ± 14 W/m2) and evaporative heat loss (83 ± 10 vs. 85 ± 12 W/m2) over the 3 h (all P > 0.05). Consequently, the changes in body heat storage (380 ± 93 vs. 358 ± 172 kJ, P = 0.67) were similar between groups. Moreover, no between-group differences in rectal and mean skin temperatures or heart rate were measured. We conclude that unacclimatized, physically active, older adults with well-controlled T2D do not experience greater hyperthermia and cardiovascular strain compared to their healthy counterparts while resting in extreme heat for a brief, 3-h period.},

   abstract = {We examined whether older individuals experience greater levels of hyperthermia and cardiovascular strain during an extreme heat exposure compared to young adults. During a 3-hour extreme heat exposure (44°C, 30% relative humidity), we compared body heat storage, core temperature (rectal, visceral) and cardiovascular (heart rate, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, limb blood flow) responses of young adults (n = 30, 19–28 years) against those of older adults (n = 30, 55–73 years). Direct calorimetry measured whole-body evaporative and dry heat exchange. Body heat storage was calculated as the temporal summation of heat production (indirect calorimetry) and whole-body heat loss (direct calorimetry) over the exposure period. While both groups gained a similar amount of heat in the first hour, the older adults showed an attenuated increase in evaporative heat loss (p < 0.033) in the first 30-min. Thereafter, the older adults were unable to compensate for a greater rate of heat gain (11 ± 1; p < 0.05) with a corresponding increase in evaporative heat loss. Older adults stored more heat (358 ± 173 kJ) relative to their younger (202 ± 92 kJ; p < 0.001) counterparts at the end of the exposure leading to greater elevations in rectal (p = 0.043) and visceral (p = 0.05) temperatures, albeit not clinically significant (rise < 0.5°C). Older adults experienced a reduction in calf blood flow (p < 0.01) with heat stress, yet no differences in cardiac output, blood pressure or heart rate. We conclude, in healthy habitually active individuals, despite no clinically observable cardiovascular or temperature changes, older adults experience greater heat gain and decreased limb perfusion in response to 3-hour heat exposure.},

Older adults are particularly vulnerable, especially those with common age-associated chronic health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease). In parallel, the global population is aging and age-associated disease rates are on the rise. Impairments in the physiological responses tasked with maintaining homeostasis during heat exposure have long been thought to contribute to increased risk of health disorders in older adults during heatwaves. As such, a comprehensive overview of the provisional links between age-related physiological dysfunction and elevated risk of heat-related injury in older adults would be of great value to healthcare officials and policy makers concerned with protecting heat-vulnerable sectors of the population from the adverse health impacts of heatwaves. In this narrative review, we therefore summarize our current understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which aging impairs the regulation of body temperature, hemodynamic stability and hydration status. We then examine how these impairments may contribute to acute pathophysiological events common during heatwaves (e.g., heatstroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury) and discuss how age-associated chronic health conditions may exacerbate those impairments. Finally, we briefly consider the importance of physiological research in the development of climate-health programs aimed at protecting heat-vulnerable individuals.},

The activation of heat advisories using evidence-based thresholds for high-risk outdoor ambient temperatures have been shown to be an effective strategy to save lives during hot weather. However, although the relationship between weather and human health has been widely defined by outdoor temperature, corresponding increases in indoor temperature during heat events can also be harmful to health especially in vulnerable populations. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the relationship between outdoor temperature and human health and examine how human health can also be adversely influenced by high indoor temperatures during heat events. Our assessment of the existing literature revealed a high degree of variability in what can be considered an acceptable indoor temperature because there are differences in how different groups of people may respond physiologically and behaviorally to the same living environment. Finally, we demonstrate that both non-physiological (e.g., geographical location, urban density, building design) and physiological (e.g., sex, age, fitness, state of health) factors must be considered when defining an indoor temperature threshold for preserving human health in a warming global climate.},

   abstract = {Human exposure to excessively warm weather, especially in cities, is an increasingly important public health problem. This study examined heat-related health inequalities within one city in order to understand the relationships between the microclimates of urban neighborhoods, population characteristics, thermal environments that regulate microclimates, and the resources people possess to cope with climatic conditions. A simulation model was used to estimate an outdoor human thermal comfort index (HTCI) as a function of local climate variables collected in 8 diverse city neighborhoods during the summer of 2003 in Phoenix, USA. HTCI is an indicator of heat stress, a condition that can cause illness and death. There were statistically significant differences in temperatures and HTCI between the neighborhoods during the entire summer, which increased during a heat wave period. Lower socioeconomic and ethnic minority groups were more likely to live in warmer neighborhoods with greater exposure to heat stress. High settlement density, sparse vegetation, and having no open space in the neighborhood were significantly correlated with higher temperatures and HTCI. People in warmer neighborhoods were more vulnerable to heat exposure because they had fewer social and material resources to cope with extreme heat. Urban heat island reduction policies should specifically target vulnerable residential areas and take into account equitable distribution and preservation of environmental resources.},

   abstract = {<p>This article interrogates the “anomalous” case of Black-founded towns, so-called because of their relative absence from discourse on Black place, their unique struggles for self-determined development, and their externally ascribed narratives of absent or dysfunctional governance, frequently invoked to explain their lack of access to basic infrastructure. We propose illuminating some of these so-called anomalies through Charles Mills’ “racial contract,” which we argue structures space at a deeper level than traditional legal arrangements and allows us to look relationally at Black towns in “white space.” We also rely on Cedric Robinson’s “racial capitalism” to demonstrate how white space develops through extraction of value from places racialized as nonwhite. Through the case of Tamina, Texas, we argue that Black towns specifically, and Black places more generally, experience racially predatory governance and resource extraction, often by nearby white places, under the guise of following mundane rules of legal jurisdiction, standard economic planning, and development. To illustrate this, we focus on three overlapping mechanisms of “creative extraction” that reinforce white spatial, political, and economic power at the expense of Black places: theft, erosion, and exclusion. These mechanisms are tied to the environmental harms inflicted on Black towns, as some of the existential threats they face.</p>},

Recent studies explore the potential economic and environmental impacts of this growth, but relatively little attention has been paid to the implications for inequality. In this paper we use household-level microdata from 16 countries to characterize empirically the relationship between climate, income, and residential air conditioning. We show that both current and future air conditioner usage is concentrated among high-income households. Not only do richer countries have much more air conditioning than poorer countries, but within countries adoption is highly concentrated among high-income households. The pattern of adoption is particularly stark in relatively low-income countries such as Pakistan, where we show that the vast majority of adoption between now and 2050 will be concentrated among the upper income tercile. We use our model to forecast future adoption, show how patterns vary across countries and income levels, and discuss what these patterns mean for health, productivity, and educational inequality.},

Since people mainly shelter indoors during wildfire smoke events, the infiltration of wildfire PM2.5 into indoor environments is a key determinant of human exposure and is potentially controllable with appropriate awareness, infrastructure investment, and public education. Using time-resolved observations outside and inside more than 1,400 buildings from the crowdsourced PurpleAir sensor network in California, we found that the geometric mean infiltration ratios (indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin/ outdoor PM2.5) were reduced from 0.4 during non-fire days to 0.2 during wildfire days. Even with reduced infiltration, the mean indoor concentration of PM2.5 nearly tripled during wildfire events, with a lower infiltration in newer buildings and those utilizing air conditioning or filtration.},

   abstract = {Background: Epidemiological research has shown that mortality increases during hot weather and heat waves, but little is known about the effect on non-fatal outcomes in the UK. Aims and Methods: The effects of hot weather and heat waves on emergency hospital admissions were investigated in Greater London, UK, for a range of causes and age groups. Time series analyses were conducted of daily emergency hospital admissions, 1 April 1994 to 31 March 2000, using autoregressive Poisson models with adjustment for long term trend, season, day of week, public holidays, the Christmas period, influenza, relative humidity, air pollution (ozone, PM 10), and overdispersion. The effects of heat were modelled using the average of the daily mean temperature over the index and previous two days. Results: There was no clear evidence of a relation between total emergency hospital admissions and high ambient temperatures, although there was evidence for heat related increases in emergency admissions for respiratory and renal disease, in children under 5, and for respiratory disease in the 75+ age group. During the heat wave of 29 July to 3 August 1995, hospital admissions showed a small non-significant increase: 2.6% (95% CI 22.2 to 7.6), while daily mortality rose by 10.8% (95% CI 2.8 to 19.3) after adjusting for time varying confounders. Conclusions: The impact of hot weather on mortality is not paralleled by similar magnitude increases in hospital admissions in the UK, which supports the hypothesis that many heat related deaths occur in people before they come to medical attention. This has evident implications for public health, and merits further enquiry.},

DESIGN Time stratified case crossover analyses with distributed lag non-linear models. SETTING US nationwide administrative healthcare claims database. PARTICIPANTS All commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (74.2 million) aged 18 years and older between May and September 2010 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Daily rates of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mental disorders based on discharge diagnosis codes. RESULTS 21 996 670 ED visits were recorded among adults with health insurance living in 2939 US counties. Days of extreme heat-defined as the 95th centile of the local warm season (May through September) temperature distribution (at 34.4°C v 14.9°C national average level)-were associated with a 7.8% (95% confidence interval 7.3% to 8.2%) excess relative risk of ED visits for any cause, 66.3% (60.2% to 72.7%) for heat related illness, 30.4% (23.4% to 37.8%) for renal disease, and 7.9% (5.2% to 10.7%) for mental disorders. Days of extreme heat were associated with an excess absolute risk of ED visits for heat related illness of 24.3 (95% confidence interval 22.9 to 25.7) per 100 000 people at risk per day. Heat was not associated with a higher risk of ED visits for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Associations were more pronounced among men and in counties in the north east of the US or with a continental climate. CONCLUSIONS Among both younger and older adults, days of extreme heat are associated with a higher risk of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, and mental disorders. These results suggest that the adverse health effects of extreme heat are not limited to older adults and carry important implications for the health of adults across the age spectrum.},

However, no quantitative studies have examined the relationships between immigrants and COVID-19 health outcomes (confirmed cases and related deaths). We first examined the relationship between total immigrants and COVID-19 health outcomes with spatial Durbin models after controlling for demographic, biophysical and socioeconomic variables. We then repeated the same analysis within multiple subimmigrant groups divided by those with original nativity to examine the differential associations with health outcomes. The result showed that the proportion of all immigrants is negatively associated with the number of confirmed cases and related deaths. At the continent and sub-continent level, we consistently found negative relationships between the number of confirmed cases and the proportion of all sub-immigrant groups. However, we observed mixed associations between the proportion of sub-immigrant groups and the number of deaths. Those counties having a higher prevalence of immigrants from Africa [Eastern Africa: –18.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): –38.3~–2.9; Northern Africa: –146.5, 95% CI: –285.5~–20.1; Middle Africa: –622.6, 95% CI: –801.4~– 464.5] and the Americas (Northern America: –90.5, 95% CI: – 106.1~–73.8; Latin America: –6.8, 95% CI: –8.1~–5.2) mostly had a lower number of deaths, whereas those counties having a higher prevalence of immigrants from Asia (Eastern Asia: 21.0, 95% CI: 7.7~36.2; Western Asia: 42.5, 95% CI: 16.9~68.8; South- Central Asia: 26.6, 95% CI: 15.5~36.9) showed a higher number of deaths. Our results partially support that some immigrants, especially those from Asia, are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other sub-population groups.},

Our work focuses on benchmarking neighborhood resilience by developing a unified, multi-factor index of local and regional resilience capacity: the Resilience to Emergencies and Disasters Index (REDI). The strength of the REDI methodology is the integration of measures of physical, natural, and social systems – operationalized through the collection and analysis of large-scale, heterogeneous, and high resolution urban data – to classify and rank the relative resilience capacity embedded in localized urban systems. Feature selection methodologies are discussed to justify the selection of included indicator variables. Hurricane Sandy is used to validate the REDI scores by measuring the recovery periods for neighborhoods directly impacted by the storm. Using over 12,000,000 records for New York City’s 311 service request system, we develop a proxy for neighborhood activity, both pre- and post-event. Hurricane Sandy had a significant and immediate impact on neighborhoods classified as least resilient based on the calculated REDI scores, while the most resilient neighborhoods were shown to better withstand disruption to normal activity patterns and more quickly recover to pre-event functional capacity.},

   abstract = {The burden of heat-related adverse occupational health effects, as well as traumatic injuries, is already substantial. Projected increases in mean temperatures and extreme events may increase the risk of adverse heat health effects and enhance disparities among exposed workers. This article reviews the emerging literature on the relationship between heat exposure and occupational traumatic injuries and discusses implications of this work. A recent meta-analysis of three case-crossover and five time series studies in industrialized settings reported an association of increasing occupational injuries with increasing heat exposure, with increased effect estimates for male gender and age less than 25&nbsp;years, although heterogeneity in exposure metrics and sources of bias were demonstrated to varying degrees across studies. A subsequent case-crossover study in outdoor construction workers reported a 0.5% increase in the odds of traumatic injuries per 1&nbsp;°C increase in maximum daily humidex (odds ratio 1.005 [95% CI 1.003–1.007]). While some studies have demonstrated reversed U-shaped associations between heat exposure and occupational injuries, different risk profiles have been reported in different industries and settings. Studies conducted primarily in industrialized settings suggest an increased risk of traumatic injury with increasing heat exposure, though the exact mechanisms of heat exposure’s effects on traumatic injuries are still under investigation. The effectiveness of heat-related injury prevention approaches has not yet been established. To enhance the effectiveness of prevention efforts, prioritization of approaches should take into account not only the hierarchy of controls, social-ecological models, community and stakeholder participation, and tailoring of approaches to specific local work settings, but also methods that reduce local and global disparities and better address the source of heat exposure, including conservation-informed land-use planning, built environment, and prevention through design approaches. Participation of occupational health experts in transdisciplinary development and integration of these approaches is needed.},

We aimed to analyze trends of heat wave characteristics and mortality associations using various criteria for the warm season (June-September) in 2011–5 for the most populated two cities in South Korea, Seoul and Busan. Hourly weather monitoring data and daily mortality data in each city were obtained. The following indices were estimated to define heat waves: air temperature, heat index (HI), humidex, apparent temperature (AT), effective temperature (ET), and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). The thresholds of each index for heat wave definitions were obtained by statistical distribution (95th percentiles) and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Thermal indices showed clustering of accumulation of excess heat above thresholds for northeast regions in the cities while air temperature showed it for central regions. Compared to 95th percentiles, the MMTs resulted 14 times longer heat wave days for thermal indices except for air temperature. When MMTs were used, nine times larger excess mortality from heat waves occurred for all indices compared to that from heat waves defined by the 95th percentiles. The thermal indices with the highest association between heat and mortality varied between the two cities: air temperature for Seoul and WBGT for Busan. Heat wave warnings should be based on a thorough comparison of how different heat wave criteria will affect the public health impact of heat wave warnings in terms of identifying a heat wave and degree of health impacts due to it.},

   abstract = {Background: The utility of patient attributes associated with the spatiotemporal analysis of medical records lies not just in their values but also the strength of association between them. Estimating the extent to which a hierarchy of conditional probability exists between patient attribute associations such as patient identifying fields, patient and date of diagnosis, and patient and address at diagnosis is fundamental to estimating the strength of association between patient and geocode, and patient and enumeration area. We propose a hierarchy for the attribute associations within medical records that enable spatiotemporal relationships. We also present a set of metrics that store attribute association error probability (AAEP), to estimate error probability for all attribute associations upon which certainty in a patient geocode depends. Methods: A series of experiments were undertaken to understand how error estimation could be operationalized within health data and what levels of AAEP in real data reveal themselves using these methods. Specifically, the goals of this evaluation were to (1) assess if the concept of our error assessment techniques could be implemented by a population-based cancer registry; (2) apply the techniques to real data from a large health data agency and characterize the observed levels of AAEP; and (3) demonstrate how detected AAEP might impact spatiotemporal health research. Results: We present an evaluation of AAEP metrics generated for cancer cases in a North Carolina county. We show examples of how we estimated AAEP for selected attribute associations and circumstances. We demonstrate the distribution of AAEP in our case sample across attribute associations, and demonstrate ways in which disease registry specific operations influence the prevalence of AAEP estimates for specific attribute associations. Conclusions: The effort to detect and store estimates of AAEP is worthwhile because of the increase in confidence fostered by the attribute association level approach to the assessment of uncertainty in patient geocodes, relative to existing geocoding related uncertainty metrics.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE
Uncertainty is not always well captured, understood, or modeled properly, and can bias the robustness of complex relationships, such as the association between the environment and public health through exposure, estimates of geographic accessibility and cluster detection, to name a few. 

METHODS
We review current challenges and future opportunities as geospatial data and analyses are applied to the field of public health. We are particularly interested in the sources of uncertainty in geospatial data and how this uncertainty may propagate in spatial analysis. 

RESULTS
We present opportunities to reduce the magnitude and impact of uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on (1) the use of multiple reference data sources to reduce geocoding errors, (2) the validity of online geocoders and how confidentiality (e.g., HIPAA) may be breached, (3) use of multiple reference data sources to reduce geocoding errors, (4) the impact of geoimputation techniques on travel estimates, (5) residential mobility and how it affects accessibility metrics and clustering, and (6) modeling errors in the American Community Survey. Our paper discusses how to communicate spatial and spatiotemporal uncertainty, and high-performance computing to conduct large amounts of simulations to ultimately increase statistical robustness for studies in public health. 

CONCLUSIONS
Our paper contributes to recent efforts to fill in knowledge gaps at the intersection of spatial uncertainty and public health.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1 • ×0.1 • grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5%, Tropical savannah).

It is now clear that positional errors can result in flawed findings and poor public health decisions. Yet the current state-of-practice is to ignore geocoding positional uncertainty, primarily because of a lack of theory, methods and tools for quantifying, modeling, and adjusting for geocoding positional errors in health analysis.This paper proposes a research agenda to address this need. It summarizes the basics of the geocoding process, its assumptions, and empirical evidence describing the magnitude of geocoding positional error. An overview of the impacts of positional error in health analysis, including accessibility, disease clustering, exposure reconstruction, and spatial weights estimation is presented. The proposed research agenda addresses five key needs: (1) a lack of standardized, open-access geocoding resources for use in health research; (2) a lack of geocoding validation datasets that will allow the evaluation of alternative geocoding engines and procedures; (3) a lack of spatially explicit geocoding positional error models; (4) a lack of resources for assessing the sensitivity of spatial analysis results to geocoding positional error; (5) a lack of demonstration studies that illustrate the sensitivity of health policy decisions to geocoding positional error. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

DESIGN Time stratified case crossover analyses with distributed lag non-linear models. SETTING US nationwide administrative healthcare claims database. PARTICIPANTS All commercial and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries (74.2 million) aged 18 years and older between May and September 2010 to 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Daily rates of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and mental disorders based on discharge diagnosis codes. RESULTS 21 996 670 ED visits were recorded among adults with health insurance living in 2939 US counties. Days of extreme heat-defined as the 95th centile of the local warm season (May through September) temperature distribution (at 34.4°C v 14.9°C national average level)-were associated with a 7.8% (95% confidence interval 7.3% to 8.2%) excess relative risk of ED visits for any cause, 66.3% (60.2% to 72.7%) for heat related illness, 30.4% (23.4% to 37.8%) for renal disease, and 7.9% (5.2% to 10.7%) for mental disorders. Days of extreme heat were associated with an excess absolute risk of ED visits for heat related illness of 24.3 (95% confidence interval 22.9 to 25.7) per 100 000 people at risk per day. Heat was not associated with a higher risk of ED visits for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Associations were more pronounced among men and in counties in the north east of the US or with a continental climate. CONCLUSIONS Among both younger and older adults, days of extreme heat are associated with a higher risk of ED visits for any cause, heat related illness, renal disease, and mental disorders. These results suggest that the adverse health effects of extreme heat are not limited to older adults and carry important implications for the health of adults across the age spectrum.},

   abstract = {Geocoding is often used to produce maps of disease rates from the diagnosis addresses of incident cases to assist with disease surveillance, prevention, and control. In this process, diagnosis addresses are converted into latitude/longitude pairs which are then aggregated to produce rates at varying geographic scales such as Census tracts, neighborhoods, cities, counties, and states. The specific techniques used within geocoding systems have an impact on where the output geocode is located and can therefore have an effect on the derivation of disease rates at different geographic aggregations. This paper investigates how county-level cancer rates are affected by the choice of interpolation method when case data are geocoded to the ZIP code level. Four commonly used areal unit interpolation techniques are applied and the output of each is used to compute crude county-level five-year incidence rates of all cancers in California. We found that the rates observed for 44 out of the 58 counties in California vary based on which interpolation method is used, with rates in some counties increasing by nearly 400% between interpolation methods.},

However, fine-resolution census boundaries often change between survey years. This research advances areal interpolation methods with dasymetric refinement to create accurate consistent population estimates in 1990 and 2000 (source zones) within tract boundaries of the 2010 census (target zones) for five demographically distinct counties in the US. Three levels of dasymetric refinement of source and target zones are evaluated. First, residential parcels are used as a binary ancillary variable prior to regular areal interpolation methods. Second, Expectation Maximization (EM) and its data-extended version leverage housing types of residential parcels as a related ancillary variable. Finally, a third refinement strategy to mitigate the overestimation effect of large residential parcels in rural areas uses road buffers and developed land cover classes. Results suggest the effectiveness of all three levels of dasymetric refinement in reducing estimation errors. They provide a first insight into the potential accuracy improvement achievable in varying geographic and demographic settings but also through the combination of different refinement strategies in parts of a study area. Such improved consistent population estimates are the basis for advanced spatio-temporal demographic research. ARTICLE HISTORY},

   abstract = {Temporal analysis of small-area demographic data commonly relies on areal interpolation methods to create temporally consistent and compatible areal units. In this study, cadastral (parcel) data are used to identify residential land and to dasymetrically refine census tracts, with the goal of achieving more accurate small-area estimates. The built date recorded for residential parcel units is used to create residential land layers for two different time points used in the areal interpolation. Three different areal interpolation methods are employed with and without dasymetric refinement, including areal weighting (AW), target density weighting (TDW) and pycnophylactic modeling (PM). The methods interpolate tract-level population counts in Hennepin County, Minnesota, in 2000 into census tract boundaries from the year 2010. The mean absolute error, median absolute error, root mean square error and the 90th percentile of absolute error are calculated for each of the methods, and spatial variation in the interpolations are displayed in maps. Parcel-based refinements are also compared with refinements using the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD).Results show that spatial refinement using residential parcels has the potential to improve the accuracy of areal interpolation for temporal analysis. Parcel-refined TDW out-performs the other tested methods, as well as the NLCD-refined TDW in this example. Parcel data identify residential land more reliably in rural areas. However, parcel units can have very large extents potentially biasing residential area delineation and population counts. Parcel-based refinement has the potential to further advance demographic change analysis over long time periods and large areas where the built date attribute is included in the dataset.},

   abstract = {Modern data linkage and technologies provide a way to reconstruct detailed longitudinal profiles of health outcomes and predictors at the individual or small-area level. Although these rich data resources offer the possibility to address epidemiologic questions that could not be feasibly examined using traditional studies, they require innovative analytical approaches. Here we present a new study design, called case time series, for epidemiologic investigations of transient health risks associated with time-varying exposures. This design combines a longitudinal structure and flexible control of time-varying confounders, typical of aggregated time series, with individual-level analysis and control-by-design of time-invariant between-subject differences, typical of self-matched methods such as case-crossover and self-controlled case series. The modeling framework is highly adaptable to various outcome and exposure definitions, and it is based on efficient estimation and computational methods that make it suitable for the analysis of highly informative longitudinal data resources. We assess the methodology in a simulation study that demonstrates its validity under defined assumptions in a wide range of data settings. We then illustrate the design in real-data examples: a first case study replicates an analysis on influenza infections and the risk of myocardial infarction using linked clinical datasets, while a second case study assesses the association between environmental exposures and respiratory symptoms using real-time measurements from a smartphone study. The case time series design represents a general and flexible tool, applicable in different epidemiologic areas for investigating transient associations with environmental factors, clinical conditions, or medications.},

   abstract = {Despite abundant data on the spatial distribution of contemporary human settlements, historical data on the long-term evolution of human settlements at fine spatial and temporal granularity is scarce, limiting our quantitative understanding of long-term changes of built-up areas. This is because commonly used mapping methods (e.g., computer vision) and suitable data sources (i.e., aerial imagery, multi-spectral remote sensing data, LiDAR) have only been available in recent decades. However, there are alternative data sources such as cadastral records that are digitally available, containing relevant information such as building age information, allowing for an approximate, digital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted a non-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from administrative institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and harmonized cadastral parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint data for 33 counties, wherever building footprint geometries and building construction year information was available. The result of this effort is a unique dataset that we call the Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Dataset for 33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million building footprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive retrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial and temporal grain and can be used for data validation purposes, or to train statistical learning approaches aiming to extract historical information on human settlements from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data sources.},

It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an update and extension of HYDE, the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE version 3.2). HYDE is an internally consistent combination of historical population estimates and allocation algorithms with time-dependent weighting maps for land use. Categories include cropland, with new distinctions for irrigated and rain-fed crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain-fed rice. Grazing lands are also provided, divided into more intensively used pasture and less intensively used rangeland, and further specified with respect to conversion of natural vegetation to facilitate global change modellers. Population is represented by maps of total, urban, rural population, population density and built-up area. The period covered is 10 000 before Common Era (BCE) to 2015 Common Era (CE). All data can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-25g-gez3. We estimate that global population increased from 4.4 million people (we also estimate a lower range <0.01 and an upper range of 8.9 million) in 10 000 BCE to 7.257 billion in 2015 CE, resulting in a global population density increase from 0.03 persons (or capita, in short cap) km-2 (range 0-0.07) to almost 56 cap km-2 respectively. The urban built-up area evolved from almost zero to roughly 58 Mha in 2015 CE, still only less than 0.5 % of the total land surface of the globe. Cropland occupied approximately less than 1 % of the global land area (13 037 Mha, excluding Antarctica) for a long time period until 1 CE, quite similar to the grazing land area. In the following centuries the share of global cropland slowly grew to 2.2 % in 1700 CE (ca. 293 Mha, uncertainty range 220-367 Mha), 4.4 % in 1850 CE (578 Mha, range 522-637 Mha) and 12.2 % in 2015 CE (ca. 1591 Mha, range 1572-1604 Mha). Cropland can be further divided into rain-fed and irrigated land, and these categories can be further separated into rice and non-rice. Rain-fed croplands were much more common, with 2.2 % in 1700 CE (289 Mha, range 217-361 Mha), 4.2 % (549 Mha, range 496-606 Mha) in 1850 CE and 10.1 % (1316 Mha, range 1298-1325 Mha) in 2015 CE, while irrigated croplands used less than 0.05 % (4.3 Mha, range 3.1-5.5 Mha), 0.2 % (28 Mha, range 25-31 Mha) and 2.1 % (277 Mha, range 273-278 Mha) in 1700, 1850 and 2015 CE, respectively. We estimate the irrigated rice area (paddy) to be 0.1 % (13 Mha, range 9-16 Mha) in 1700 CE, 0.2 % (28 Mha, range 26-31 Mha) in 1850 CE and 0.9 % (118 Mha, range 117-120 Mha) in 2015 CE. The estimates for land used for grazing are much more uncertain. We estimate that the share of grazing land grew from 5.1 % in 1700 CE (667 Mha, range 507-820 Mha) to 9.6 % in 1850 CE (1192 Mha, range 1068-1304 Mha) and 24.9 % in 2015 CE (3241 Mha, range 3211-3270 Mha). To aid the modelling community we have divided land used for grazing into more intensively used pasture, less intensively used converted rangeland and less or unmanaged natural unconverted rangeland. Pasture occupied 1.1 % in 1700 CE (145 Mha, range 79-175 Mha), 1.9 % in 1850 CE (253 Mha, range 218-287 Mha) and 6.0 % (787 Mha, range 779-795 Mha) in 2015 CE, while rangelands usually occupied more space due to their occurrence in more arid regions and thus lower yields to sustain livestock. We estimate converted rangeland at 0.6 % in 1700 CE (82 Mha range 66-93 Mha), 1 % in 1850 CE (129 Mha range 118-136 Mha) and 2.4 % in 2015 CE (310 Mha range 306-312 Mha), while the unconverted natural rangelands occupied approximately 3.4 % in 1700 CE (437 Mha, range 334-533 Mha), 6.2 % in 1850 CE (810 Mha, range 733-881 Mha) and 16.5 % in 2015 CE (2145 Mha, range 2126-2164 Mha).},

The Like-ness toolkit accomplishes these goals with a suite of Python packages: pymedm/pymedm_legacy, livelike, and actlike. This production process is initialized in pymedm (or pymedm_legacy) that utilizes census microdata records as the foundation on which disaggregated spatial allocation matrices are built. The next step, performed by livelike, is the generation of a fully autonomous agent population attributed with hundreds of demographic census variables. The agent population synthesized in livelike is then attributed with residential coordinates in actlike based on block assignment and, finally, allocated to an optimal daytime activity location via the street network. We present a case study in Knox County, Tennessee, synthesizing 30 populations of public K-12 school students & teachers and allocating them to schools. Validation of our results shows they are highly promising by replicating reported school enrollment and teacher capacity with a high degree of fidelity.},

   abstract = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples. © 1976 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In a cohort of 18.9 million Medicare beneficiaries (4.2 million deaths) living across the conterminous United States between 2000 and 2008, we examined the association between chronic PM2.5 exposure and cause-specific mortality. We evaluated confounding through adjustment for neighborhood behavioral covariates and decomposition of PM2.5 into 2 spatiotemporal scales. We found significantly positive associations of 12-month moving average PM2.5 exposures (per 10-μg/m3 increase) with respiratory, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia mortality, with risk ratios ranging from 1.10 to 1.24. We also found significant PM2.5-associated elevated risks for cardiovascular and lung cancer mortality. Risk ratios generally increased with longer moving averages; for example, an elevation in 60-month moving average PM2.5 exposures was linked to 1.33 times the lung cancer mortality risk (95% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.40), as compared with 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.11, 1.15) for 12-month moving average exposures. Observed associations were robust in multivariable models, although evidence of unmeasured confounding remained. In this large cohort of US elderly, we provide important new evidence that long-term PM2.5 exposure is significantly related to increased mortality from respiratory disease, lung cancer, and cardiovascular disease.</p>},

   abstract = {Illness and mortality related to heat and worsening air quality are core public health concerns associated with climate change projections. We examined the historical relationship between age- and cause-specific mortality rates from 1980 through 2006 and heat events at the 99th percentile of humidex values in the historic period from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2006 in the greater Seattle area (King, Pierce and Snohomish counties), Spokane County, the Tri-Cities (Benton and Franklin counties) and Yakima County; the relative risks of mortality during heat events were applied to population and climate projections for Washington State to calculate number of deaths above the baseline (1980–2006) expected during projected heat events in 2025, 2045 and 2085. Three different warming scenarios were used in the analysis. Relative risks for the greater Seattle area showed a significant dose-response relationship between heat event duration and daily mortality rates for non-traumatic deaths for persons ages 45 and above, typically peaking at four days of exposure to humidex values above the 99th percentile. The largest number of projected excess deaths in all years and scenarios for the Seattle region was found for age 65 and above. Under the middle warming scenario, this age group is expected to have 96, 148 and 266 excess deaths from all non-traumatic causes in 2025, 2045 and 2085, respectively. We also examined projected excess deaths due to ground-level ozone concentrations at mid century (2045–2054) in King and Spokane counties. Current (1997–2006) ozone measurements and mid-twenty-first century ozone projections were coupled with dose-response data from the scientific literature to produce estimates overall and cardiopulmonary mortality. Daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations are forecasted to be 16–28% higher in the mid twenty-first century compared to the recent decade of 1997–2006. By mid-century in King County the non-traumatic mortality rate related to ozone was projected to increase from baseline (0.026 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval 0.013–0.038) to 0.033 (95% CI 0.017–0.049). For the same health outcome in Spokane County, the baseline period rate of 0.058 (95% CI 0.030–0.085) was estimated increase to 0.068 (95% CI 0.035–0.100) by mid-century. The cardiopulmonary death rate per 100,000 due to ozone was estimated to increase from 0.011 (95% CI 0.005–0.017) to 0.015 (0.007–0.022) in King County, and from 0.027 (95% CI 0.013–0.042) to 0.032 (95% CI 0.015–0.049) in Spokane County. Public health interventions aimed at protecting Washington’s population from excessive heat and increased ozone concentrations will become increasingly important for preventing deaths, especially among older adults. Furthermore, heat and air quality related illnesses that do not result in death, but are serious nevertheless, may be reduced by the same measures.},

   abstract = {<p> Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM <sub>2.5</sub> ) is a major global health concern. Quantitative estimates of attributable mortality are based on disease-specific hazard ratio models that incorporate risk information from multiple PM <sub>2.5</sub> sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from use of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking), requiring assumptions about equivalent exposure and toxicity. We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a PM <sub>2.5</sub> -mortality hazard ratio function based only on cohort studies of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range. We modeled the shape of the association between PM <sub>2.5</sub> and nonaccidental mortality using data from 41 cohorts from 16 countries—the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We then constructed GEMMs for five specific causes of death examined by the global burden of disease (GBD). The GEMM predicts 8.9 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.5–10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure 30% larger than that predicted by the sum of deaths among the five specific causes (6.9; 95% CI: 4.9–8.5) and 120% larger than the risk function used in the GBD (4.0; 95% CI: 3.3–4.8). Differences between the GEMM and GBD risk functions are larger for a 20% reduction in concentrations, with the GEMM predicting 220% higher excess deaths. These results suggest that PM <sub>2.5</sub> exposure may be related to additional causes of death than the five considered by the GBD and that incorporation of risk information from other, nonoutdoor, particle sources leads to underestimation of disease burden, especially at higher concentrations. </p>},

   abstract = {Background: Public health applications using geographic information system (GIS) technology are steadily increasing. Many of these rely on the ability to locate where people live with respect to areas of exposure from environmental contaminants. Automated geocoding is a method used to assign geographic coordinates to an individual based on their street address. This method often relies on street centerline files as a geographic reference. Such a process introduces positional error in the geocoded point. Our study evaluated the positional error caused during automated geocoding of residential addresses and how this error varies between population densities. We also evaluated an alternative method of geocoding using residential property parcel data. Results: Positional error was determined for 3,000 residential addresses using the distance between each geocoded point and its true location as determined with aerial imagery. Error was found to increase as population density decreased. In rural areas of an upstate New York study area, 95 percent of the addresses geocoded to within 2,872 m of their true location. Suburban areas revealed less error where 95 percent of the addresses geocoded to within 421 m. Urban areas demonstrated the least error where 95 percent of the addresses geocoded to within 152 m of their true location. As an alternative to using street centerline files for geocoding, we used residential property parcel points to locate the addresses. In the rural areas, 95 percent of the parcel points were within 195 m of the true location. In suburban areas, this distance was 39 m while in urban areas 95 percent of the parcel points were within 21 m of the true location. Conclusion: Researchers need to determine if the level of error caused by a chosen method of geocoding may affect the results of their project. As an alternative method, property data can be used for geocoding addresses if the error caused by traditional methods is found to be unacceptable. © 2003 Cayo and Talbot; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: The assignment of a point-level geocode to subjects' residences is an important data assimilation component of many geographic public health studies. Often, these assignments are made by a method known as automated geocoding, which attempts to match each subject's address to an address-ranged street segment georeferenced within a streetline database and then interpolate the position of the address along that segment. Unfortunately, this process results in positional errors. Our study sought to model the probability distribution of positional errors associated with automated geocoding and E911 geocoding. Results: Positional errors were determined for 1423 rural addresses in Carroll County, Iowa as the vector difference between each 100%-matched automated geocode and its true location as determined by orthophoto and parcel information. Errors were also determined for 1449 60%-matched geocodes and 2354 E911 geocodes. Huge (> 15 km) outliers occurred among the 60%-matched geocoding errors; outliers occurred for the other two types of geocoding errors also but were much smaller. E911 geocoding was more accurate (median error length = 44 m) than 100%-matched automated geocoding (median error length = 168 m). The empirical distributions of positional errors associated with 100%-matched automated geocoding and E911 geocoding exhibited a distinctive Greek-cross shape and had many other interesting features that were not capable of being fitted adequately by a single bivariate normal or t distribution. However, mixtures of t distributions with two or three components fit the errors very well. Conclusion: Mixtures of bivariate t distributions with few c omponents appear to be flexible enough to fit many positional error datasets associated with geocoding, yet parsimonious enough to be feasible for nascent applications of measurement-error methodology to spatial epidemiology. © 2007 Zimmerman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Recent evidence suggests a synergistic acute effect between temperature, ozone and particulate matter (PM) on premature mortality. Several studies reported higher air pollution-related mortality risks during warm days, and higher heat-related mortality risk during polluted days. We investigated if interactions between temperature and air pollution modified the mortality response to an extent that would support the need for joint heat and air pollution warning systems. We developed a multicentre time-series design for 17 French cities for the period 2000–2015, investigating the influence of season and temperature on the air pollution (PM10 and ozone)-mortality relationship, and the influence of air pollution on the temperature-mortality relationship. Ozone and PM10 mortality risks exhibit an increasing gradient between spring, summer and heat waves. For instance, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 3% [Confidence interval (CI) 95% 2.1:3.9] increase in mortality during summer, and with a 14.2% [CI 95% 5.6:23.4] increase in mortality during heat waves. The heat-mortality response was slightly influenced by air pollution, especially during the most extreme heat waves. Our results suggest that air pollution warnings should take season into account, using lower thresholds during summer and heat waves. Heat warning systems may not be improved by air pollution data, as its added value would be limited, compared to the complexity it would add to the warning systems. Efforts should be made to reduce ozone and PM10 concentrations during heat waves, even when they are already below regulatory thresholds.},

The research questions include: (1) What are the positional accuracies and matching rates of various geocoding techniques? (2) Are there any significant differences of geocoding quality in rural and urban areas? In this study, 1100 residential addresses scattered across Texas, USA, were address-matched using eight different geocoding platforms, including the ESRI ArcGIS Address Locator, CoreLogic PxPoint, Google Maps API, Yahoo! PlaceFinder, Microsoft Bing, Geocoder.us, Texas A&M University Geocoder, and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The geocoded locations for each method were validated against the GPS data and manual digitization. Using GPS data as reference data, the desktop geocoding using parcel data achieved the highest positional accuracy with a mean error of 24.8 m, whereas the Google Maps API was the best among the six Internet solutions with a mean error of 31.7 m. All geocoding solutions, except Geocoder.us and OSM, achieved a matching rate >95%. It is important to note, however, that the OSM geocoding revealed decent positional accuracy in terms of median and 5% trimmed mean errors, indicating the potential of crowdsourcing approach to produce an accurate geospatial data set. The geocoding errors between urban and rural areas were significantly different in most geocoding solutions but there was no consistent and monotonic trend. Excluding the errors of outliers, defined as the lowest 5 percentile, indeed changed the direction of urban versus rural accuracy in OSM, PxPoint, and ArcGIS geocoding.},

   abstract = {Association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory health is well documented. At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health, increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather-air pollution interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate that the increased level of PM10 and O3 results in significantly higher rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O3, CO, and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis, and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels. Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both urban heat islands effect and air pollution.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Population change impacts almost every aspect of global change from land use, to greenhouse gas emissions, to biodiversity conservation, to the spread of disease. Data on spatial patterns of population density help us understand patterns and drivers of human settlement and can help us quantify the exposure we face to natural disasters, pollution, and infectious disease. Human populations are typically recorded by national or regional units that can vary in shape and size. Using these irregularly sized units and ancillary data related to population dynamics, we can produce high-resolution gridded estimates of population density through intelligent dasymetric mapping (IDM). The gridded population density provides a more detailed estimate of how the population is distributed within larger units. Furthermore, we can refine our estimates of population density by specifying uninhabited areas which have impacts on the analysis of population density such as our estimates of human exposure. In this study, we used various geospatial datasets to expand the existing specification of uninhabited areas within the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) EnviroAtlas Dasymetric Population Map for the conterminous United States (CONUS). When compared to the existing definition of uninhabited areas for the EnviroAtlas dasymetric population map, we found that IDM's population estimates for the US Census Bureau blocks improved across all states in the CONUS. We found that IDM performed better in states with larger urban areas than in states that are sparsely populated. We also updated the existing EnviroAtlas Intelligent Dasymetric Mapping toolbox and expanded its capabilities to accept uninhabited areas. The updated 30 m population density for the CONUS is available via the EPA's Environmental Dataset Gateway (Baynes et al., 2021, https://doi.org/10.23719/1522948) and the EPA's EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas, last access: 15 June 2022; Pickard et al., 2015).},

   abstract = {Background: Exposure to cold or hot temperatures is associated with premature deaths. We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national mortality burden associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures. Methods: In this modelling study, we collected time-series data on mortality and ambient temperatures from 750 locations in 43 countries and five meta-predictors at a grid size of 0·5° × 0·5° across the globe. A three-stage analysis strategy was used. First, the temperature–mortality association was fitted for each location by use of a time-series regression. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was built between location-specific estimates and meta-predictors. Finally, the grid-specific temperature–mortality association between 2000 and 2019 was predicted by use of the fitted meta-regression and the grid-specific meta-predictors. Excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, the ratio between annual excess deaths and all deaths of a year (the excess death ratio), and the death rate per 100 000 residents were then calculated for each grid across the world. Grids were divided according to regional groupings of the UN Statistics Division. Findings: Globally, 5 083 173 deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 4 087 967–5 965 520) were associated with non-optimal temperatures per year, accounting for 9·43% (95% eCI 7·58–11·07) of all deaths (8·52% [6·19–10·47] were cold-related and 0·91% [0·56–1·36] were heat-related). There were 74 temperature-related excess deaths per 100 000 residents (95% eCI 60–87). The mortality burden varied geographically. Of all excess deaths, 2 617 322 (51·49%) occurred in Asia. Eastern Europe had the highest heat-related excess death rate and Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest cold-related excess death rate. From 2000–03 to 2016–19, the global cold-related excess death ratio changed by −0·51 percentage points (95% eCI −0·61 to −0·42) and the global heat-related excess death ratio increased by 0·21 percentage points (0·13–0·31), leading to a net reduction in the overall ratio. The largest decline in overall excess death ratio occurred in South-eastern Asia, whereas excess death ratio fluctuated in Southern Asia and Europe. Interpretation: Non-optimal temperatures are associated with a substantial mortality burden, which varies spatiotemporally. Our findings will benefit international, national, and local communities in developing preparedness and prevention strategies to reduce weather-related impacts immediately and under climate change scenarios.

   abstract = {Extreme weather events can strongly affect surface air quality, which has become a major environmental factor to affect human health. Here, we examined the relationship between extreme ozone and PM2.5 (particular matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) events and the representative meteorological parameters such as daily maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum relative humidity (RHmin), and minimum wind speed (Vmin), using the location-specific 95th or 5th percentile threshold derived from historical reanalysis data (30 years for ozone and 10 years for PM2.5). We found that ozone and PM2.5 extremes were decreasing over the years, reflecting EPA's tightened standards and effort on reducing the corresponding precursor's emissions. Annual ozone and PM2.5 extreme days were highly correlated with Tmax and RHmin, especially in the eastern U.S. They were positively (negatively) correlated with Vmin in urban (rural and suburban) stations. The overlapping ratios of ozone extreme days with Tmax were fairly constant, about 32%, and tended to be high in fall and low in winter. Ozone extreme days were most sensitive to Tmax, then RHmin, and least sensitive to Vmin. The majority of ozone extremes occurred when Tmax was between 300 K and 320 K, RHmin was less than 40%, and Vmin was less than 3 m/s. The number of annual extreme PM2.5 days was highly positively correlated with the extreme RHmin/Tmax days, with correlation coefficient between PM2.5/RHmin highest in urban and suburban regions and the correlation coefficient between PM2.5/Tmax highest in rural area. Tmax has more impact on PM2.5 extreme over the eastern U.S. Extreme PM2.5 days were more likely to occur at low RH conditions in the central and southeastern U.S., especially during spring time, and at high RH conditions in the northern U.S. and the Great Plains. Most extreme PM2.5 events occurred when Tmax was between 300 K and 320 K and RHmin was between 10% and 50%. Extreme PM2.5 days usually occurred when Vmin was under 2 m/s. However, during spring season in the Southeast and fall season in Northwest, high winds were found to accompany extreme PM2.5 days, likely reflecting the impact of fire emissions.},

We have identified significant increasing trends for the occurrences of extreme air pollution meteorological events in the past six decades, especially over the continental regions. Statistical analysis combining air quality data and meteorological data further indicates strong sensitivities of air quality (including both average air pollutant concentrations and high pollution episodes) to extreme meteorological events. For example, we find that in the United States the probability of severe ozone pollution when there are heat waves could be up to seven times of the average probability during summertime, while temperature inversions in wintertime could enhance the probability of severe particulate matter pollution by more than a factor of two. We have also identified significant seasonal and spatial variations in the sensitivity of air quality to extreme air pollution meteorology.},

Currently there are many different RF imputation algorithms, but relatively little guidance about their efficacy. Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, imputation performance of various RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate unsupervised and supervised splitting—the latter class representing a generalization of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Our findings reveal RF imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation. Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases) when data was missing not at random.},

   abstract = {Spatial techniques and fine-scale geographic data may be combined in a variety of innovative ways to serve high-resolution population modeling efforts at local scales, which has been further facilitated by growing computation power and access to open-source spatial data. Previous work has highlighted the importance of a dasymetric approach to produce a parcel-based high-resolution gridded population surface (HGPS). In this study, we investigate the application of land-cover data integrated with the parcel-based HGPS to further improve the accuracy of the HGPS. Consideration is given to twelve combinations made by three land cover strategies (1- no land cover class, 2- five separate classes, and 3- three combined classes) and four property type strategies (1- seven types from an empirical study, 2- eight residential types, 3- seventeen types within Alachua County, and 4- twenty-five types within Florida). Results from different strategies are statistically compared with the most significant combination identified as three combined land-cover classes (heavy vegetation, 0-50% and >50-100% impervious surface) and with seven property types from the empirical study (single family, mobile family, multi-family (≥10 and <10 units), condominiums, mobile homes parks, and homes for the aged). A final data set named the Enhanced HGPS (E-HGPS) is created for Alachua County, Florida, with a distribution of population counts at the scale of individual housing units. This study highlights an innovative approach to incorporating land-cover and parcel data for the purpose of spatial population modeling, and holds potential to broaden the E-HGPS to a state or regional scope.},

   abstract = {This paper presents methods and results of small-area population estimation using a combined Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and parcel dataset for a study area in Denton, Texas, USA. A normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was created from a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital elevation model (DEM) built from LiDAR point data. Residential and commercial parcels were selected from parcel data and used as a mask to remove non-residential and non-commercial pixels from the nDSM. Classification results of residential areas from Landsat TM images acquired on two dates were used to further refine the nDSM. Using continuous and random census blocks as samples, building count, building area and building volume were calculated from the nDSM through mathematical morphological operations, zonal statistics, data conversion and spatial joining in a geographic information system (GIS). Combined with census 2000 data, a total of 10 ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were built and applied to the census blocks in the study area. Finally, accuracy assessments were carried out. The results show that the sign and magnitude of the relative estimation errors at the census-block level lead to underestimation of the total population in the study area. Possible reasons for the relatively low accuracies and problems for further investigation are also discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {Comparing demographic small area estimates across multiple time periods is hindered by boundary changes in census enumeration units. Areal interpolation can resolve temporal incompatibilities, but underlying assumptions of uniform population density within units is sometimes flawed and results in distorted estimates. Dasymetric modeling refines spatial precision by limiting areal interpolation to the most likely residential areas. Here, a systematic examination of the impacts of dasymetric refinement on temporal interpolation accuracy compares errors that emerge as a consequence of differing time spans. This paper compares the accuracy of three commonly utilized methods of areal interpolation for temporal analysis of population data over the 1990-2010 decades. It examines whether multioral dasymetric refinement prior to areal interpolation improves the accuracy of small area estimates, comparing two different demographic contexts. Data sets include tract-level demography exhibiting dramatic growth (Las Vegas, Nevada), and relative stability (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Areal interpolation with and without the dasymetric refinement is validated using block level data. The dasymetrically refined target density weighting (TDW) provides the overall best performance for the 2000 source data and the expectation maximization (EM) method gives the overall best performance for the 1990 source data; effects of refinement are more prominent in areas of faster population change.},

We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, "Random Forest" estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at ∼100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

   abstract = {The analysis of changes in urban land and population is important because the majority of future population growth will take place in urban areas. U.S. Census historically classifies urban land using population density and various land-use criteria. This study analyzes the reliability of census-defined urban lands for delineating the spatial distribution of urban population and estimating its changes over time. To overcome the problem of incompatible enumeration units between censuses, regular areal interpolation methods including Areal Weighting (AW) and Target Density Weighting (TDW), with and without spatial refinement, are implemented. The goal in this study is to estimate urban population in Massachusetts in 1990 and 2000 (source zones), within tract boundaries of the 2010 census (target zones), respectively, to create a consistent time series of comparable urban population estimates from 1990 to 2010. Spatial refinement is done using ancillary variables such as census-defined urban areas, the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) as well as different combinations of them. The study results suggest that census-defined urban areas alone are not necessarily the most meaningful delineation of urban land. Instead, it appears that alternative combinations of the above-mentioned ancillary variables can better depict the spatial distribution of urban land, and thus make it possible to reduce the estimation error in transferring the urban population from source zones to target zones when running spatially-refined temporal areal interpolation.},

One common practice has been to guide interpolation by using ancillary control zones that are related to the variable of interest's spatial distribution. This guidance typically involves using source zone data to estimate the density of the variable of interest within each control zone. This article introduces a novel approach to density estimation, the geographically weighted expectation-maximization (GWEM), which combines features of two previously used techniques, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and geographically weighted regression. The EM algorithm provides a framework for incorporating proper constraints on data distributions, and using geographical weighting allows estimated control-zone density ratios to vary spatially. We assess the accuracy of GWEM by applying it with land use/land cover (LULC) ancillary data to population counts from a nationwide sample of 1980 U.S. census tract pairs. We find that GWEM generally is more accurate in this setting than several previously studied methods. Because target-density weighting (TDW)-using 1970 tract densities to guide interpolation-outperforms GWEM in many cases, we also consider two GWEM-TDW hybrid approaches and find them to improve estimates substantially. © 2013 The Ohio State University.},

This article presents a broad assessment of areal interpolation models for estimating counts of 2000 characteristics in 2010 census units throughout the United States. We interpolate from 2000 census block data using 4 types of ancillary data to guide interpolation: 2010 block densities, imperviousness data, road buffers, and water body polygons. We test 8 binary dasymetric (BD) models and 8 target-density weighting (TDW) models, each using a unique combination of the 4 ancillary data types, and derive 2 hybrid models that blend the best-performing BD and TDW models. The most accurate model is a hybrid that generally gives high weight to TDW (allocating 2000 data in proportion to 2010 densities) but gives increasing weight to a BD model (allocating data uniformly within developed land near roads) in proportion to the estimated 2000–2010 rate of change within each block. Although for most 2010 census units, this hybrid model's estimates differ little from the simplest model's estimates, there are still many areas where the estimates differ considerably. Estimates from the final model, along with lower and upper bounds for each estimate, are publicly available for over 1000 population and housing characteristics at 10 geographic levels via the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS – http://nhgis.org).},

Then, through regression analysis of a large sample of U.S. census tract data, a model is produced that relates the error in TDW estimates of tract population to four basic properties of tracts. An analysis of model residuals combined with theorized absolute limits on interpolation error yields formulas with which we can compute upper and lower prediction bounds on the population in a tract of one census at the time of a different census.

Areal interpolation methods are commonly used to solve such zoning incompatibilities, but are frequently based on the questionable assumption of homogeneous population density within the different zones. To achieve more accurate estimates, land cover or other ancillary data may be used to better characterize the underlying source zone population density surface prior to areal interpolation. Although dasymetric techniques such as these are well documented, their effectiveness across different areal interpolation methods are not well established. This research compares the accuracy of a number of areal interpolation methods used to support temporal analysis of population data, and evaluates the effect of dasymetric mapping on interpolation accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that dasymetric refinement noticeably improves interpolation accuracy for the areal weighting, pycnophylactic, and target density weighting (TDW) methods of areal interpolation. A fourth method in which land cover densities are inherently incorporated, the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), performs equally well. Our results show that the dasymetrically refined TDW method outperforms other areal interpolation methods in most instances, but suggest that the EM algorithm may be preferred as the interval between enumeration periods grows large.},

This study adds to our understanding of the relative merits of alternative methods by comparing dasymetric, street network, and surface-based models interpolating across two spatial resolutions. It examines the importance of the ancillary data source used to drive the process, particularly the efficacy of open access products. Results from an empirical study show that interpolation accuracy is influenced by the choice of ancillary data input as well as the methodological approach adopted. The strongest overall performance is delivered by dasymetric mapping combined with open access data identifying the locations of buildings.

Land cover information can be used in combination with detailed settlement extents to redistribute aggregated census counts to improve the accuracy of national-scale gridded population data. In East Africa, such analyses have been done using regional land cover data, thus restricting application of the approach to this region. If gridded population data are to be improved across Africa, an alternative, consistent and comparable source of land cover data is required. Here these analyses were repeated for Kenya using four continent-wide land cover datasets combined with detailed settlement extents and accuracies were assessed against detailed census data. The aim was to identify the large area land cover dataset that, combined with detailed settlement extents, produce the most accurate population distribution data. The effectiveness of the population distribution modelling procedures in the absence of high resolution census data was evaluated, as was the extrapolation ability of population densities between different regions. Results showed that the use of the GlobCover dataset refined with detailed settlement extents provided significantly more accurate gridded population data compared to the use of refined AVHRR-derived, MODIS-derived and GLC2000 land cover datasets. This study supports the hypothesis that land cover information is important for improving population distribution model accuracies, particularly in countries where only coarse resolution census data are available. Obtaining high resolution census data must however remain the priority. With its higher spatial resolution and its more recent data acquisition, the GlobCover dataset was found as the most valuable resource to use in combination with detailed settlement extents for the production of gridded population datasets across large areas. © 2010 The Author(s).},

Three methods of dasymetric interpolation were tested: (i) binary, (ii) three-class, and (iii) limiting variable. Our enhanced limiting variable approach introduced an adjustment factor for parcel vacancy rates in the dasymetric calculations, and applied dasymetric mapping techniques to disaggregate future population projections to the tax lot level of analysis. The limiting variable interpolation generated the lowest coefficient of variation (0.188), followed by the three-class interpolation (0.645). We also found that population densities vary substantially within land use classes of single family, medium density and high density classes, and these variations also highlighted the importance of incorporating vacancy rates when interpolating population counts to categorical land use data. Overall, the enhanced dasymetric mapping technique is particularly useful for examining the impact of sea-level rise as its derivatives are compatible with high resolution LiDAR and orthoimagery data.

In contrast, research on areal interpolation has been more thorough and has examined methods of transferring data from one set of map zones to another, an issue that is applicable to dasymetric mapping. Inspired by this work, we tested five dasymetric mapping methods, including methods derived from work on areal interpolation. Dasymetric maps of six socio-economic variables were produced for a study area of 159 counties in the eastern U.S. using county choropleth data and ancillary land-use data. Both polygonal (vector) and grid (raster) dasymetric methods were tested. We evaluated map accuracy using both statistical analyses and visual presentations of error. A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed that the traditional limiting variable method had significantly lower error than the other four methods. In addition, polygon methods had lower error than their grid-based counterparts, though the difference was not statistically significant. Error maps largely supported the conclusions from the statistical analysis, while also presenting patterns of error that were not obvious from the statistics.},

Results indicate that the performance of dasymetric methods varies substantially among study areas, and no single technique consistently outperforms all others. The three best techniques are imperviousness with values greater than 75 percent removed, imperviousness with values greater than 60 percent removed, and land cover.

   abstract = {Mismatching sets of boundaries present a persistent problem in spatial analysis for many different applications. Dasymetric mapping techniques can be employed to estimate population characteristics of small areas that do not correspond to census enumeration boundaries. Several types of ancillary data have been used in dasymetric mapping but performance is often limited by their relatively coarse resolution and moderate correspondence to actual population counts. The current research examines the performance of using high resolution ancillary data in the form of individual address point datasets which represent the locations of all addressable units within a jurisdiction. The performance of address points was compared with several other techniques, including areal weighting, land cover, imperviousness, road density and nighttime lights. Datasets from 16 counties in Ohio were used in the analysis, reflecting a range of different population densities. For each technique the ancillary data sources were employed to estimate census block group population counts using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared with the known block group population counts. Results indicate that address points perform significantly better compared with other types of ancillary data. The overall error for all block groups (n = 683) using address points is 4.9% compared with 10.8% for imperviousness, 11.6% for land cover, 13.3% for road density, 18.6% for nighttime lights and 21.2% for areal weighting. Using only residential address points rather than all types of locations further reduces this error to 4.2%. Analysis of the spatial patterns in the relative performance of the various techniques revealed that address points perform particularly well in low density rural areas, which typically present challenges for traditional dasymetric mapping techniques using land cover datasets. These results provide very strong support for the use of address points for small area population estimates. Current developments in the growing availability of address point datasets and the implications for spatial demographic analyses are discussed. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {A dasymetric map depicts a statistical surface, most commonly population density, as a set of simply connected regions, such that variation within each region is minimized and the region boundaries approximate the steepest escarpments of the surface. Dasymetric mapping has its roots in early thematic mapping of population, but has recently been taken up by researchers focusing on areal interpolation and population estimation using remote sensing. The process of dasymetric mapping typically involves the disaggregation of population data encoded in choropleth map form using an ancillary spatial data set, most commonly either an area-class map or satellite image. The functional relationship between the ancillary data and the statistical surface being mapped may be specified a priori by the researcher or estimated using a variety of statistical techniques. Challenges facing dasymetric mapping research include handling spatio-temporal data and the development of standardized and accessible methods. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Rather than using data aggregated by arbitrary administrative boundaries such as census tracts, we use dasymetric mapping, an areal interpolation method using ancillary information to delineate areas of homogeneous values. We review previous dasymetric mapping techniques (which often use remotely sensed land-cover data) and contrast them with our technique, Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System (CEDS), which is particularly suitable for urban areas. The CEDS method uses specific cadastral data, land-use filters, modeling by expert system routines, and validation against various census enumeration units and other data. The CEDS dasymetric mapping technique is presented through a case study of asthma hospitalizations in the Bronx, New York City, in relation to proximity buffers constructed around major sources of air pollution. The case study shows the impact that a more accurate estimation of population distribution has on a current environmental justice and health disparities research project, and the potential of CEDS for other GIS applications.},

   abstract = {Geospatial techniques, using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing data, have become more commonly used with dasymetric modeling of fine-scale demographic data. In this study, we apply a dasymetric approach using the Heuristic Sampling Method for 2010 parcel data to disaggregate population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census into a quadrilateral grid composed of 30×30mcells covering the Alachua County, Florida. The final output, termed the High-resolution Gridded Population Surface (HGPS), is compared to a land cover-based population product (LCPP) and the detail of each product is assessed. Results suggest that the HGPS provides increased spatial heterogeneity and more detail in the boundaries of populated areas over the use of census blocks or land cover lots. For an example of the final output, we use a case study at the Cabot-Koppers Superfund Site to demonstrate the advantages of the HGPS over the LCPP. The HGPS is expected to serve as a more accurate input in various research fields, such as public health, crime analysis, and climate change. The approach outlined provides an improved means of producing spatially-explicit population grids where fine-scale ancillary data, such as parcel data, is available. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Intensive urbanization has led to the depletion of vegetation and its replacement by impervious surfaces, resulting in the accumulation of thermal energy, with urban areas becoming warmer than peripheral areas, a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Much of the literature has focused on the relationship between the UHI and urban factors at peak summer times, without considering seasonality effects. There is, however, clear evidence that the UHI varies over the year, with implications for greening mitigation strategies, as green spaces are known to help reduce summer local temperatures, but also reduce exposure to winter cold, thus increasing local winter temperatures. Both effects are likely to generate, in varying extents, benefits in terms of better health and reduced energy usage and pollution emissions. This paper addresses the seasonality of the impacts of building rooftop and façade areas, urban canyons, water bodies, vegetation, and solar radiation, on UHI intensity. In a case study of the central area of Columbus, Ohio, these various 2D and 3D inputs, as well as land surface temperatures estimated with remotely-sensed imagery, are captured within a spatial grid, and used in spatial regression analyses. The estimation results confirm the opposite effects of greenery, measured by the NDVI, on summer and winter temperatures. The estimated models are then used to simulate the seasonal changes in temperatures resulting from a potential urban greening strategy involving green roofs, the greening of parking lots and other vacant spaces, and vegetation densification. The results show that increased greenery reduces temperatures in summer and increases them in winter, thus demonstrating that greening and land-use policies designed to mitigate the UHI must account for seasonal effects to achieve year-long effectiveness.},

   abstract = {Dasymetric-mapping and pycnophylactic-interpolation methods have solid theoretical foundations and empirical supports in population-estimation research. Each of the methods has its own strengths, but also suffers obvious shortcomings. Dasymetric mapping makes good use of ancillary information to infer most likely population distribution, whereas it suffers from the unfounded assumption of uniform distribution of population among all eligible locations. Pycnophylactic interpolation warrants a smooth population surface in the study area without any presumption of uniform distribution. However, the method does not draw on information about real population distribution, so that its estimation accuracy cannot benefit from such useful information. In this paper, we develop a hybrid approach that takes advantage of the strengths and remedies the flaws of both methods. The hybrid method is tested with a case study. To evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid method, this study compares its estimation accuracy with those of other popular methods including areal-weighting interpolation, binary dasymetric mapping and the pycnophylactic-interpolation method. The comparison results prove that the proposed hybrid method significantly outperforms the other methods. In addition, the study conducts a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of search-radius size, which is the key parameter of the hybrid method, on estimation accuracy. The analysis result shows that the hybrid method can be further improved with appropriate choice of search radius. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {To better understand the dynamics of human settlements, thorough knowledge of the uncertainty in geospatial built-up surface datasets is critical. While frameworks for localized accuracy assessments of categorical gridded data have been proposed to account for the spatial non-stationarity of classification accuracy, such approaches have not been applied to (binary) built-up land data. Such data differs from other data such as land cover data, due to considerable variations of built-up surface density across the rural-urban continuum resulting in switches of class imbalance, causing sparsely populated confusion matrices based on small underlying sample sizes. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by testing common agreement measures for their suitability and plausibility to measure the localized accuracy of built-up surface data. We examine the sensitivity of localized accuracy to the assessment support, as well as to the unit of analysis, and analyze the relationships between local accuracy and density / structure-related properties of built-up areas, across rural-urban trajectories and over time. Our experiments are based on the multi-temporal Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and a reference database for the state of Massachusetts (USA). We find strong variation of suitability among commonly used agreement measures, and varying levels of sensitivity to the assessment support. We then apply our framework to assess localized GHSL data accuracy over time from 1975 to 2014. Besides increasing accuracy along the rural-urban gradient, we find that accuracy generally increases over time, mainly driven by peri-urban densification processes in our study area. Moreover, we find that localized densification measures derived from the GHSL tend to overestimate peri-urban densification processes that occurred between 1975 and 2014, due to higher levels of omission errors in the GHSL epoch 1975.},

   abstract = {Epidemiologic analyses of the health effects of meteorological exposures typically rely on observations from the nearest weather station to assess exposure for geographically diverse populations. Gridded climate datasets (GCD) provide spatially resolved weather data that may offer improved exposure estimates, but have not been systematically validated for use in epidemiologic evaluations. As a validation, we linearly regressed daily weather estimates from two GCDs, PRISM and Daymet, to observations from a sample of weather stations across the conterminous United States and compared spatially resolved, population-weighted county average temperatures and heat indices from PRISM to single-pixel PRISM values at the weather stations to identify differences. We found that both Daymet and PRISM accurately estimate ambient temperature and mean heat index at sampled weather stations, but PRISM outperforms Daymet for assessments of humidity and maximum daily heat index. Moreover, spatially-resolved exposure estimates differ from point-based assessments, but with substantial inter-county heterogeneity. We conclude that GCDs offer a potentially useful approach to exposure assessment of meteorological variables that may, in some locations, reduce exposure measurement error, as well as permit assessment of populations distributed far from weather stations.},

   abstract = {Ambient temperature and relative humidity are readily ava-ilable and thus tempting metrics for heat stress assessment. Two methods of using air temperature and relative humidity to create an index are Heat Index and Adjusted Temperature. The purposes of this article are: (1) to examine how well Heat Index and Adjusted Temperature estimated the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index, and (2) to suggest how Heat Index and Adjusted Temperature can be used to screen for heat stress level. Psychrometric relationships were used to estimate values of actual WBGT for conditions of air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant heat at an air speed of 0.5 m/s. A relationship between Heat Index [°F] and WBGT [°C] was described by WBGT = -0.0034 HI2 + 0.96 HI - 34. At lower Heat Index values, the equation estimated WBGTs that were ±2°C-WBGT around the actual value, and to about ±0.5°C-WBGT for Heat Index values > 100°F. A relationship between Adjusted Temperature [°F] and WBGT [°C] was described by WBGT = 0.45 Tadj - 16. The actual WBGT was between 1°C-WBGT below the estimated value and 1.4°C-WBGT above. That is, there was a slight bias toward overestimating WBGT from Adjusted Temperature. Heat stress screening tables were constructed for metabolic rates of 180, 300, and 450 W. The screening decisions were divided into four categories: (1) < alert limit, (2) < exposure limit, (3) hourly time-weighted averages (TWAs) of work and recovery, and (4) a caution zone for an exposure > exposure limit at rest. The authors do not recommend using Heat Index or Adjusted Temperature instead of WBGT, but they may be used to screen for circumstances when a more detailed analysis using WBGT is appropriate. A particular weakness is accounting for radiant heat; and neither air speed nor clothing was considered.},

Taking advantage of these observations, we generated a 30-yr climatology (1991-2020) of mean monthly global irradiance at a resolution of 30 arc s (∼800 m) on both a horizontal surface and a sloped ground surface. This paper describes the methods used to generate the gridded data, which include extensive quality control of station data, spatial interpolation of effective cloud transmittance using the "PRISM" method, and simulation of the effects of elevation, shading, and reflection from nearby terrain on solar irradiance. A comparison of the new dataset with several other solar radiation products reveals some spatial features in solar radiation that are either lacking or underresolved in some or all of the other datasets. Examples of these features include strong gradients near foggy coastlines and along mountain ranges where there is persistent orographically driven cloud formation. The workflow developed to create the long-term means will be used as a template for generating time series of monthly and daily solar radiation grids up to the present.},

   abstract = {A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature., precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 km' in the northwestern USA, for 1 year, including a detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAR) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7X! and 1.2"C, with biases of +O.l"C and-O.l"C, respectively. MAR for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily},

   abstract = {Now that summer has spread its oppressive ridge over most of the Southern Region, NWS phones are ringing off their hooks with questions about the Heat Index. Many questions regard the actual equation used in calculating the Heat Index. Some callers are satisfied with the response that it is extremely complicated. Some are satisfied with the nomogram (see Attachment 1). But there are a few who will settle for nothing less than the equation itself. No true equation for the Heat Index exists. Heat Index values are derived from a collection of equations that comprise a model. This Technical Attachment presents an equation that approximates the Heat Index and, thus, should satisfy the latter group of callers. The Heat Index (or apparent temperature) is the result of extensive biometeorological studies. The parameters involved in its calculation are shown below (from Steadman, 1979). Each of these parameters can be described by an equation but they are given assumed magnitudes (in parentheses) in order to simplify the model. # Vapor pressure. Ambient vapor pressure of the atmosphere. (1.6 kPa) # Dimensions of a human. Determines the skin's surface area. (5' 7" tall, 147 pounds) # Effective radiation area of skin. A ratio that depends upon skin surface area. (0.80) # Significant diameter of a human. Based on the body's volume and density. (15.3 cm) # Clothing cover. Long trousers and short-sleeved shirt is assumed. (84% coverage) # Core temperature. Internal body temperature. (98.6°F) # Core vapor pressure. Depends upon body's core temperature and salinity. (5.65 kPa) # Surface temperatures and vapor pressures of skin and clothing. Affects heat transfer from the skin's surface either by radiation or convection. These values are determined by an iterative process. # Activity. Determines metabolic output.

Angle between vectors influences convection from skin surface (below). (5 kts) # Clothing resistance to heat transfer. The magnitude of this value is based on the assumption that the clothing is 20% fiber and 80% air. # Clothing resistance to moisture transfer. Since clothing is mostly air, pure vapor diffusion is used here. # Radiation from the surface of the skin. Actually, a radiative heat-transfer coefficient determined from previous studies. # Convection from the surface of the skin. A convection coefficient also determined from previous studies.

A stochastic model is proposed which represents areal interpolations in diverse geographic situations. The model is used to examine the relationship between estimation accuracy and the spatial distribution of estimation error from a theoretical viewpoint. The analysis shows that the uniformity in error distribution improves the accuracy of areal interpolation. Four areal interpolation methods are then assessed through numerical examinations. From this it is found that the accuracy of simple interpolation methods heavily depends on the appropriateness of their hypothetical distributions, whereas the accuracy of intelligent methods depends on the ®tness of the range of supplementary data for that of true distribution.},

Maximum daily temperature was positively associated with internet searches relevant to heat, and searches were in turn positively associated with heat-related ED visits. Moreover, models combining internet search activity and temperature had better predictive ability for heat-related ED visits compared to models with temperature alone. These results suggest that internet search patterns may be useful as a leading indicator of heat-related illness or stress.},

High-resolution spatial information on historical human population distribution is of great significance to understand human-environment interactions and their temporal dynamics. However, the complex relationship between population distribution and various influencing factors coupled with limited data availability make it a challenge to reconstruct human population distribution over timescales of centuries. This study generated 1-km decadal population maps for the conterminous US from 1790 to 2010 using parsimonious models based on natural suitability, socioeconomic desirability, and inhabitability. Five models of increasing complexity were evaluated. The models were validated with census tract and county subdivision population data in 2000 and were applied to generate five sets of 22 historical population maps from 1790-2010. Separating urban and rural areas and excluding non-inhabitable areas were the most important factors for improving the overall accuracy. The generated gridded population datasets and the production and validation methods are described here.},

However, most of these analyses do not use spatially explicit measures of heat (typically assessing exposures at major cities using the nearest weather station), and they frequently consider only ambient temperature or heat index. The field is moving toward more expansive analyses that use spatially resolved gridded meteorological datasets and alternative assessments of heat, such as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI), both of which require technical geoscientific skills that may be inaccessible to many public health researchers. To facilitate research in this domain, we created a database of population-weighted, spatially explicit daily heat metrics – including WBGT, UTCI, heat index, dewpoint temperature, net effective temperature, and humidex – for counties in the conterminous United States derived from the ERA5-Land gridded data set and using previously validated equations and algorithms.

   abstract = {Objective: Management of the natural and built environments can help reduce the health impacts of climate change. This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. Methods: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007–2016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). Results: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036–1.043 per 1 °C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026–1.039 and 1.043, 1.037–1.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality. Conclusions: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an important contribution towards informing city-level climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.},

   abstract = {Forces are aligning to shift American health care into the Information Age: an age which financial institutions, airlines, supermarkets and most manufacturing industries have already entered. The shift, which these institutions have already experienced, will facilitate the establishment and widespread use of standardized databases in health care. The databases are known by the terms electronic medical records (EMRs), electronic health record (EHRs) or personal health records (PHRs). These forces underlie today's shift towards full use of a universally accepted electronic medical record, electronic health record and for a personal health record: • An unprecedented revolution in computer and communication technologies • The widespread availability of affordable electronic tools • Burgeoning interest among patients in having access to their own medical information • Rapid progress in understanding the human genome and proteosome • The rising cost of health care • The increasing administrative burden upon physicians • A perception that medical errors are increasing • Demands for widely comparable measures of quality care • The need for post-marketing surveys of new drugs • Our increasingly mobile society • Greater emphasis upon evidence-based medicine • Reimbursement incentives that pay for using EHRs and for providing quality care • Reduced malpractice premiums for physicians that fully employ these technologies. An EMR contains the results of clinical and administrative encounters between a provider (physician, nurse, telephone triage nurse, and others) and a patient that occur during episodes of patient care. Consequently, the EMR reflects the practice style, job function, knowledge and skill of the providers who create it. It necessarily includes data structures and data elements that reflect those providers' systems. In an attempt to bring some structure to this emerging field, in 1991 the Institute of Medicine defined the basic functions of an EMR, then known as the computer-based patient record (CPR). The Institute of Medicine's definition remains the gold standard (see Table 1 on page 58). To supplement the provider-generated information in the EMR, the personal health record (PHR) is a medical record maintained by the patient. The PHR includes electronic copies of information patients have received from their providers. Finally, the concept of the EHR was formulated to integrate an individual's multiple, physician-generated, electronic medical records and the patient-generated personal health record. Intended to be comprehensive, the EHR should facilitate optimal management of the health of an individual or, when used in aggregate, of a population. EHRs should allow sharing of information about patients between any authorized providers. A patient should be able to enter any health care setting, provide authorization, and then consult with a provider who has ready access to his complete health record. EHRs should be securely linked over the Internet and should be integrated seamlessly with medical information for the education of both providers and patients. Table 2 lists common functions of an EHR divided by practice, clinical, system, and chemotherapy/drug management components. Table 2 lists some common medical and oncology-specific data elements (data fields) for an electronic health record.},

This study proposes a methodology for assessing the impacts on human health due to pollutants emitted from building materials during the 'use phase'. The proposed methodology estimates the amounts of pollutants emitted from building materials by applying the emission factors measured by chamber tests to the emission models. Then, the human health impacts are derived by multiplying the intake fraction and human health effect factors by the amount of pollutants emitted from building materials. In case study, the human carcinogenic potential (HCP) (6.74E-05 casecan) calculated by the proposed methodology was almost identical to the HCP (6.80E-05 casecan) calculated by the health risk assessment. It turns out that the proposed methodology is capable of producing reasonable results. The proposed methodology can be expected to assess the human health impacts of buildings more accurately in LCA. In addition, the proposed methodology will be useful to improving the indoor environment of buildings because it can predict the impacts on human health during the building design phase.},

   abstract = {<p>Housing quality is a well-established determinant for health and its relevance has been increasing in the context of sustainable development. Prior research has emphasized the importance of adequate housing for the health and comfort of householders. However, this link is still poorly characterized and understood regarding the vulnerable segments of the population. In this study, a mediation analysis is proposed to test and identify the role of energy affordability in the relationship between poor housing and health status. It resorts to microdata from the European Union—Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) database, focusing on the analysis of Portugal as the case study. Research findings confirm the role of energy affordability as a mediator. The research findings supported the energy efficiency as a direct pathway with protective and preventive effect for poor health, followed by energy affordability as a mediated or indirect pathway. A complementary approach that addresses energy efficiency and energy poverty should be pursued to maximize health risk reduction.</p>},

   abstract = {The United States spends more on health care than any other OECD country, yet the nation’s health is declining. Recent research has identified multiple sources for this decline, including one’s position in social and economic structures, environmental quality, and individual and collective social capital. This paper assesses the primary hypotheses that the health effects of household energy burden, social capital and environmental quality on aggregated community health levels remain while controlling for other determinants. The analysis moves beyond prior research by integrating multiple secondary data sources to assess those effects across US counties. Three indicators of public health are analyzed (premature mortality, self-reported health, and life expectancy). The county-level energy burden is measured by the percent of household income spent on housing energy bills for low-and moderate-income households. In addition to energy burden, social capital, environmental quality and other determinants are included in the analysis. The results produced by multivariate regression models support the primary hypotheses, even while a number of control variables also have a significant effect on health. The paper concludes that public health is associated with a complex nexus of factors, including environmental quality and social capital, and that energy burden needs to be among the considerations.},

Based on the operation data of a residential ground source heat pump (GSHP) system, a pre-processing procedure was set up, including acquisition, cleaning, missing-data fill-in, and standardization. Then hierarchical clustering was used, based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance calculation method. A new index, the sum of squares of errors based on DTW, was used to determine the best cluster number. The patterns were extracted based on clustering results. The heat exchange on the user-side during one cooling season was processed as a case study. We obtained 5 valid clusters and extracted patterns from each. For the studied case, the result based on the DTW method yields a better homogeneity compared to the Euclidean method. The method is then applied to a five-year operation data, where 9 and 6 patterns were obtained for the cooling and heating seasons, respectively. They mainly differed in shape, and the cooling patterns fluctuate more. Overall, clustering and pattern extraction can reduce the data dimension, and provide a data-driven view of how the system supplies the cooling and heating.},

   abstract = {Background: Observational studies have found an increased risk of adverse effects such as hemorrhage, stroke, and increased mortality in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The impact of prior use of these medications on outcomes in critically ill patients has not been previously examined. We performed a retrospective study to determine if preadmission use of SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is associated with mortality differences in patients admitted to the ICU. Methods: The retrospective study used a modifiable data mining technique applied to the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC) 2.6 database. A total of 14,709 patient records, consisting of 2,471 in the SSRI/SNRI group and 12,238 control subjects, were analyzed. The study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: After adjustment for age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, vasopressor use, ventilator use, and combined Elixhauser score, SSRI/SNRI use was associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.40; P = .026). Among patient subgroups, risk was highest in patients with acute coronary syndrome (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21-3.13; P = .006) and patients admitted to the cardiac surgery recovery unit (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.04; P = .008). Mortality appeared to vary by specific SSRI, with higher mortalities associated with higher levels of serotonin inhibition. Conclusions: We found significant increases in hospital stay mortality among those patients in the ICU taking SSRI/SNRIs prior to admission as compared with control subjects. Mortality was higher in patients receiving SSRI/SNRI agents that produce greater degrees of serotonin reuptake inhibition. The study serves to demonstrate the potential for the future application of advanced data examination techniques upon detailed (and growing) clinical databases being made available by the digitization of medicine. © 2014 American College of Chest Physicians.},

   abstract = {Measuring and identifying the correlates and drivers of mortality are key functions of public health research. Information on seasonal mortality, and its inter-annual variations, enables prioritising and evaluating interventions during particular times of the year. It also provides the basis to study the association of death rates with seasonal temperature. My thesis aimed to provide and apply a statistical framework to characterise seasonality of death rates by cause of death, month, sex and age group, and to understand the role of temperature as a predictor, and possibly determinant, of how seasonal mortality changes from year to year and geographically. I generated death rates from geo-coded vital registration data on all 85.5 million deaths in the entire contiguous United States over a 37-year period (1980-2016). I grouped the underlying causes of death into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive broad causes (cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, injuries, other) along with further sub-causes for cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries. I processed ERA-Interim reanalysis weather data to create population-weighted monthly temperature statistics. I applied wavelet, centre of gravity and circular statistics methods to analyse seasonal dynamics of mortality. I found that overall death rates for those 45 years and older were highest in the winter, mostly due to cardiorespiratory disease deaths. In contrast, death rates in adolescents and young adults peaked in the summer, mostly due to injury deaths. Seasonal differences in older age groups have changed little over time, whereas in young children they have largely disappeared. I then formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to estimate how anomalous monthly temperature - defined as temperature deviation compared to long-term norm for each state and month - affects deaths from different causes. A 1°C anomalously warm year in the entire contiguous United States would be associated with an estimated 941 (95% credible interval (CrI) 831, 1,053) additional injury deaths (0.5% of total injury deaths in 2016), concentrated in adolescent to middle-aged males. There would be an estimated 4,369 (4,024, 4,706) fewer cardiorespiratory disease deaths (0.4% of total cardiorespiratory disease deaths in 2016), concentrated in those 55 years and older. There would be a decrease of cardiorespiratory disease deaths in all but summer months. I found no association between anomalous monthly temperature and cancer deaths. Continued efforts are necessary to address seasonal peaks in mortality, particularly in older age groups, across the United States, especially in a changing climate.},

   abstract = {Temperatures that deviate from the long-term local norm affect human health, and are projected to become more frequent as the global climate changes1. There are limited data on how such anomalies affect deaths from injuries. In the present study, we used data on mortality and temperature over 38 years (1980–2017) in the contiguous USA and formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to quantify how anomalous temperatures, defined as deviations of monthly temperature from the local average monthly temperature over the entire analysis period, affect deaths from unintentional (transport, falls and drownings) and intentional (assault and suicide) injuries, by age group and sex. We found that a 1.5 °C anomalously warm year, as envisioned under the Paris Climate Agreement2, would be associated with an estimated 1,601 (95% credible interval 1,430–1,776) additional injury deaths. Of these additional deaths, 84% would occur in males, mostly in adolescence to middle age. These would comprise increases in deaths from drownings, transport, assault and suicide, offset partly by a decline in deaths from falls in older ages. The findings demonstrate the need for targeted interventions against injuries during periods of anomalously warm temperatures, especially as these episodes are likely to increase with global climate change.},

While there have been many studies on both heatrelated illness (HRI), there are fewer on heat-related morbidity than on heatrelated mortality. Objective To identify individual and environmental risk factors for hospitalizations and document patterns of household cooling. Methods We performed a pooled cross-sectional analysis of secondary U.S. data, the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Risk ratios were calculated from multivariable models to identify risk factors for hospitalizations. Hierarchical modeling was also employed to identify relationships between individual and hospital level predictors of hospitalizations. Patterns of air conditioning use were analyzed among the vulnerable populations identified. Results Hospitalizations due to HRI increased over the study period compared to all other hospitalizations. Populations at elevated risk for HRI hospitalization were blacks, males and all age groups above the age of 40. Those living in zip-codes in the lowest income quartile and the uninsured were also at an increased risk. Hospitalizations for HRI in rural and small urban clusters were elevated, compared to urban areas. Conclusions Risk factors for HRI include age greater than 40, male gender and hospitalization in rural areas or small urban clusters. Our analysis also revealed an increasing pattern of HRI hospitalizations over time and decreased association between common comorbidities and heat illnesses which may be indicative of underreporting.},

   abstract = {Spatial climate data sets of 1971-2000 mean monthly precipitation and minimum and maximum temperature were developed for the conterminous United States. These 30-arcsec (∼800-m) grids are the official spatial climate data sets of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) interpolation method was used to develop data sets that reflected, as closely as possible, the current state of knowledge of spatial climate patterns in the United States. PRISM calculates a climate-elevation regression for each digital elevation model (DEM) grid cell, and stations entering the regression are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the station to the grid cell. Factors considered are location, elevation, coastal proximity, topographic facet orientation, vertical atmospheric layer, topographic position, and orographic effectiveness of the terrain. Surface stations used in the analysis numbered nearly 13 000 for precipitation and 10 000 for temperature. Station data were spatially quality controlled, and short-period-of-record averages adjusted to better reflect the 1971-2000 period. PRISM interpolation uncertainties were estimated with cross-validation (C-V) mean absolute error (MAE) and the 70% prediction interval of the climate-elevation regression function. The two measures were not well correlated at the point level, but were similar when averaged over large regions. The PRISM data set was compared with the WorldClim and Daymet spatial climate data sets. The comparison demonstrated that using a relatively dense station data set and the physiographically sensitive PRISM interpolation process resulted in substantially improved climate grids over those of WorldClim and Daymet. The improvement varied, however, depending on the complexity of the region. Mountainous and coastal areas of the western United States, characterized by sparse data coverage, large elevation gradients, rain shadows, inversions, cold air drainage, and coastal effects, showed the greatest improvement. The PRISM data set benefited from a peer review procedure that incorporated local knowledge and data into the development process. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services.},

Exploiting climate indicators and the use of passive strategies are among the central principles of this design approach. The main purpose of the present study is to provide bioclimatic design strategies to enhance the human thermal comfort in the humid climate zones based on Cfa Köppen climate classification. This study focused on to improve indoor thermal comfort with climate indicators. The eight cities studied include Rasht (Iran), Durban (South Africa), Tokyo (Japan), Kutaisi (Georgia), Houston (United States), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Brisbane (Queensland) and Trieste (Italy) according to similarities in the climatic zones and the most important criteria climates such as humidity and rainfall were selected all around the world. Hereafter, the city of Rasht was directly investigated as a case study. In this way at first, the climatic data of Rasht collected. Then it analyzed concerning the Givoni Bioclimatic Chart and Mahoney Table to determine the appropriate bioclimatic design strategies. In the following, these strategies plotted from the Givoni chart and the Mahoney table and the design recommendations provided as diagrams related to the strategies and debated separately. In the end, the executive function of the strategies regarding the relations between the zones of Givoni bioclimatic chart and months of the year, and also the strategies have discussed the indicators of the Mahoney table as well. The extensive findings described in this paper allowed us to conclude that certain bioclimatic design strategies that have been adopted in specific cities and countries could be exported to other zones with similar climates because they were proven to be useful functional architectural design strategies that resulted to improve human indoor thermal comfort.},

Outdoor and indoor (living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens) concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, CO, CO2, and TVOCs were measured simultaneously in 28 private residences using direct-reading monitors during the period from March to June 2021. Information on occupants, household characteristics and indoor activities was collected via a questionnaire. Furthermore, air exchange rates (AERs) were measured in the living rooms and bedrooms of all monitored homes. Distribution of elderly exposures in the monitored microenvironments was calculated based on time-activity diary applied in all residences to collect information on the activities and time spent by elders in each microenvironment. During coronavirus outbreak, results showed that in average elderly spend 99% of their time indoors (63% in bedrooms, 33% in living rooms, and 3% in kitchens). The daily average exposures of elders to PM10, PM2.5, CO, CO2, and TVOCs in all selected residences were 92.9 ± 18.8 μg/m3, 65.3 ± 12.4 μg/m3, 1.0 ± 0.5 ppm, 886.6 ± 97.1 ppm, and 309.3 ± 73.7 μg/m3, respectively. Living rooms and bedrooms had the highest contribution to the elderly exposure to measured air pollutants. The results and performed statistical analyses (Pearson correlation and t-test) confirmed that indoor activities (cooking, smoking, and cleaning) can significantly influence IAQ in living rooms and bedrooms. Other factors including occupancy, AER, room volume, and proximity to major roads were also found to be significant determinants (p < 0.05) of IAQ in these two microenvironments.},

However, most epidemiologic studies have focused on understanding their additive effects, despite that individuals are exposed to multiple air pollutants simultaneously that are likely correlated with each other. Therefore, we applied a novel method - Bayesian Kernel machine regression (BKMR) and conducted a population-based cohort study to assess the individual and joint effect of air pollutant mixtures (PM2.5, O3, and NO2) on all-cause mortality among the Medicare population in 15 cities with 656 different ZIP codes in the southeastern US. The results suggest a strong association between pollutant mixture and all-cause mortality, mainly driven by PM2.5. The positive association of PM2.5 with mortality appears stronger at lower percentiles of other pollutants. An interquartile range change in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a significant increase in mortality of 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.9), 1.6 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.7) and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.6) standard deviations (SD) when O3 and NO2 were set at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, respectively. BKMR analysis did not identify statistically significant interactions among PM2.5, O3, and NO2. However, since the small sub-population might weaken the study power, additional studies (in larger sample size and other regions in the US) are in need to reinforce the current finding.},

   abstract = {About 2.8 billion people around the world still depend on biomass as their primary energy source. This traditional custom affects the environment and severely impacts the health and life quality of the rural residents, especially in the elderly group. Based on the published data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) conducted in 2018, this paper carefully explores the impact of the energy consumption revolution on the health of rural elderly adults and its response mechanism. The results from the empirical analysis show that: (1) The positive response of rural families to the energy consumption revolution can significantly improve the elderly adults' health condition; (2) The energy consumption revolution can improve the rural elderly adults' health by enhancing the home environmental sanitation (home environmental effect) and life satisfaction (psychological effect); (3) In the process of energy consumption revolution affecting the rural elderly's health, the factor age plays a negative regulatory role, in other words, the older the elderly, the lower the marginal effect of energy consumption revolution on their health improvement. This paper uses the propensity score matching method to deal with the endogenous problem of the regression model, and uses a placebo test and the substitution estimation method to check the robustness of the empirical results. As well, this research puts forward some policy suggestions, such as increasing investment in energy infrastructure in rural areas, reducing the cost of using clean energy, combining environmental energy protection with increasing energy income, and improving medical security conditions in rural areas.},

   abstract = {Research has shown that diurnal temperature range (DTR) is significantly associated with mortality and morbidity in regions of Asia; however, few studies have been conducted in other regions such as North America. Thus, we examined DTR effects on mortality in the USA. We used mortality and environmental data from the National Morbidity Mortality Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). The data are daily mortality, air pollution, and temperature statistics from 95 large US communities collected between 1987 and 2000. To assess community-specific DTR effects on mortality, we used Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion. After assessing community-specific DTR effects on mortality, we estimated region- and age-specific effects of DTR using two-level normal independent sampling estimation. We found a significant increase of 0.27 % [95 % confidence intervals (CI), 0.24–0.30 %] in nonaccidental mortality across 95 communities in the USA associated with a 1 °C increase in DTR, controlling for apparent temperature, day of the week, and time trend. This overall effect was driven mainly by effects of DTR on cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in the elderly: Mortality in the above 65 age group increased by 0.39 % (95 % CI, 0.33–0.44 %) and 0.33 % (95 % CI, 0.22–0.44 %), respectively. We found some evidence of regional differences in the effects of DTR on nonaccidental mortality with the highest effects in Southern California [0.31 % (95 % CI, 0.21–0.42 %)] and smallest effects in the Northwest and Upper Midwest regions [0.22 % (95 % CI, 0.11–0.33 %) and 0.22 % (95 % CI, 0.07–0.37 %), respectively]. These results indicate a statistically significant association between DTR and mortality on average for 95 large US communities. The findings indicate that DTR impacts on nonaccidental and cardiovascular-related mortality in most US regions and the elderly population was most vulnerable to the effects of DTR.},

A systematic search of the Medline database through April 2006 extracted detailed information about exposure measures, socioeconomic indicators, subjects' characteristics and principal results. Fifteen articles (time series, case-crossover, cohort) examined short-term effects. The variety of socioeconomic indicators studied made formal comparisons difficult. One striking fact emerged: studies using socioeconomic characteristics measured at coarser geographic resolutions (city- or county-wide) found no effect modification, but those using finer geographic resolutions found mixed results, and five of six studies using individually-measured socioeconomic characteristics found that pollution affected disadvantaged subjects more. This finding was echoed by the six studies of long-term effects (cohorts) identified; these had substantial methodological differences, which we discuss extensively. Current evidence does not yet justify a definitive conclusion that socioeconomic characteristics modify the effects of air pollution on mortality. Nevertheless, existing results, most tending to show greater effects among the more deprived, emphasise the importance of continuing to investigate this topic.},

We aimed to establish a new AHI by integrating daily mortality risks due to air pollution with those due to non-optimum temperature in China. Based on the exposure-response (E-R) coefficients obtained from time-series models, the new AHI was constructed as the sum of excess mortality risk associated with air pollutants and non-optimum temperature in 272 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2015. We examined the association between the “total AHI” (based on total mortality) and total mortality, and further compared the ability of the “total AHI” to predict specific cardiopulmonary mortality with that of “specific AHIs” (based on specific mortalities). On average, air pollution and non-optimum temperature were associated with 28.23% of daily excess mortality, of which 23.47% was associated with non-optimum temperature while the remainder was associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (1.12%), NO2 (2.29%,), and O3 (2.29%). The new AHI uses a 10-point scale and shows an average across all 272 cities of 6 points. The E-R curve for AHI and mortality is approximately linear, without any thresholds. Each one unit increase in “total AHI” is associated with a 0.84% increase in all-cause mortality and 1.01%, 0.98%, 1.02%, 1.66%, and 1.71% increases in cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, stroke, respiratory diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality, respectively. Cause-specific mortality risk estimates using the “total AHI” are similar to those predicted by “specific AHIs.” In conclusion, the “total AHI” proposed herein could be a promising tool for communicating health risks related to exposure to the ambient environment to the public.},

   abstract = {Introduction: There is an increasing interest in understanding whether air pollutants modify the quantitative relationships between temperature and health outcomes. The results of available studies were, however, inconsistent. This study aims to sum up the current evidence and provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic. Methods: We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The modified Navigation Guide was applied to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence. We calculated pooled temperature-related mortality at low and high pollutant levels respectively, using the random-effects model. Results: We identified 22 eligible studies, eleven of which were included in the meta-analysis. Significant effect modification was observed on heat effects for all-cause and non-accidental mortality by particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 μm (PM10) and ozone (O3) (p < 0.05). The excess risks (ERs) for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.4% (4.4%, 6.4%) and 6.3% (4.8%, 7.8%) at the low PM10 level, 8.8% (7.5%, 10.1%) and 11.4% (8.7%, 14.2%) at the high PM10 level, respectively. As for O3, the ERs for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.1% (3.9%, 6.3%) and 3.6% (0.1%, 7.2%) at the low O3 level, 7.6% (6.3%, 9.0%) and 12.5% (4.7%, 20.9%) at the high O3 level, respectively. Surprisingly, the heat effects on cardiovascular mortality were found to be lower at high carbon monoxide (CO) levels [ERs = 5.4% (3.9%, 6.9%)] than that at low levels [ERs = 9.4% (7.0%, 11.9%)]. The heterogeneity varied, but the results of sensitivity analyses were generally robust. Significant effect modification by air pollutants was not observed for heatwave or cold effects. Conclusions: PM10 and O3 modify the heat-related all-cause and non-accidental mortality, indicating that policymakers should consider air pollutants when establishing heat-health warning systems. Future studies with comparable designs and settings are needed.},

   abstract = {Background: The health impacts of ambient air pollution impose large costs on society. Although all people are exposed to air pollution, the older population (ie, those aged ≥60 years) tends to be disproportionally affected. As a result, there is growing concern about the health impacts of air pollution as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the spatial and temporal variation in the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient air pollution and its interaction with population ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. Methods: In this global analysis, we developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life-year (VSLY) to estimate the economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution using Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 data and country-level socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age-specific and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) attributable to PM2·5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model and global estimates of exposure at 0·1° × 0·1° (about 11 km × 11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and 2016, we translated the YLLs within each age group into a health-related cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY. Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the temporal change in health costs related to PM2·5. Finally, we did a sensitivity test to analyse the variability of the estimated health costs to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and concentration–response functions by age, cause, country, and year. All economic values are reported in 2011 purchasing power parity-adjusted US dollars. All simulations were done with R, version 3.6.0. Findings: Globally, in 2016, PM2·5 was estimated to have caused 8·42 million (95% UI 6·50–10·52) attributable deaths, which was associated with 163·68 million (116·03–219·44) YLLs. In 2016, the global economic cost of deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution for the older population was US$2·40 trillion (1·89–2·93) accounting for 59% (59–60) of the cost for the total population ($4·09 trillion [3·19–5·05]). The economic cost per capita for the older population was $2739 (2160–3345) in 2016, which was 10 times that of the younger population (ie, those aged <60 years). By assessing the factors that contributed to economic costs, we found that increases in these factors changed the total economic cost by 77% for gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, 21% for population ageing, 16% for population growth, −41% for age-specific mortality, and −0·4% for PM2·5 exposure. Interpretation: The economic cost of ambient PM2·5 borne by the older population almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth, population ageing, and population growth. Compared with younger people, air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs among older people, even after accounting for their relatively shorter life expectancy and increased disability. As the world's population is ageing, the disproportionate health cost attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution potentially widens the health inequities for older people. Countries with severe air pollution and rapid ageing rates need to take immediate actions to improve air quality. In addition, strategies aimed at enhancing health-care services, especially targeting the older population, could be beneficial for reducing the health costs of ambient air pollution.

   abstract = {Background: Increasing number of studies have linked air pollution exposure with renal function decline and disease. However, there is a lack of data on its impact among end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients and its potential modifying effect from extreme heat events (EHE). Methods: Fresenius Kidney Care records from 28 selected northeastern US counties were used to pool daily all-cause mortality (ACM) and all-cause hospital admissions (ACHA) counts. County-level daily ambient PM2.5 and ozone (O3) were estimated using a high-resolution spatiotemporal coupled climate-air quality model and matched to ESKD patients based on ZIP codes of treatment sites. We used time-stratified case-crossover analyses to characterize acute exposures using individual and cumulative lag exposures for up to 3 days (Lag 0–3) by using a distributed lag nonlinear model framework. We used a nested model comparison hypothesis test to evaluate for interaction effects between air pollutants and EHE and stratification analyses to estimate effect measures modified by EHE days. Results: From 2001 to 2016, the sample population consisted of 43,338 ESKD patients. We recorded 5217 deaths and 78,433 hospital admissions. A 10-unit increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 5% increase in ACM (rate ratio [RRLag0–3]: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.10) and same-day O3 (RRLag0: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03) after adjusting for extreme heat exposures. Mortality models suggest evidence of interaction and effect measure modification, though not always simultaneously. ACM risk increased up to 8% when daily ozone concentrations exceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standards established by the United States, but the increases in risk were considerably higher during EHE days across lag periods. Conclusion: Our findings suggest interdependent effects of EHE and air pollution among ESKD patients for all-cause mortality risks. National level assessments are needed to consider the ESKD population as a sensitive population and inform treatment protocols during extreme heat and degraded pollution episodes.},

   abstract = {Weather and climate conditions drive the evolution of tropical glaciers which play an important role as water reservoirs for Peruvian inhabitants in the arid coast and semi-arid Andean region. The scarcity of long-term high-quality observations over Peruvian glaciers has motivated the extensive use of reanalysis data to describe the climatic evolution of these glaciers. However, the representativeness and uncertainties of these reanalysis products over these glaciers are still poorly constrained. This study evaluates the ability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis (ERA5L) to reproduce hourly and monthly 2 m air temperature and relative humidity (T2m and Rh2m, respectively) over several Peruvian glaciers. We compared the ERA5L with data from four on-glacier automatic weather stations (AWS), whose hourly time series were completed with nearby stations, for the period January 2017 to December 2019. Results indicates a better performance of the reanalysis for T2m (r >0.80) than for Rh2m (∼0.4< r <∼0.6) in all four glaciers. Concerning the observations, both parameters show a daily cycle influenced by the presence of the glacier. This influence is more prominent during the dry months when the so-called glacier damping and cooling effects are stronger. On a monthly time scale, the ERA5L validation for both parameters are better in wet outer tropical sites (RMSE between ±0.2°C for T2m and between 3%–7% for Rh2m) rather than in dry outer tropical sites (RMSE between ±0.2°C for T2m and between 3%–7% for Rh2m). Among all sites considered in the study, the Rh2m bias is the highest in the Cavalca glacier (correlation of 0.81; RMSE 13%, MAE 11% and bias 8.3%) and the lowest in Artesonraju glacier (correlation of 0.96; RMSE 3%; MAE 2.3% and bias — 0.8%). Based on certain considerations outlined in this paper, it is appropriate to use ERA5L to characterize T2m and Rh2m conditions on Peruvian glaciers, particularly in the wet outer tropics.},

   abstract = {Increased exposure to extreme heat from both climate change and the urban heat island effect—total urban warming—threatens the sustainability of rapidly growing urban settlements worldwide. Extreme heat exposure is highly unequal and severely impacts the urban poor. While previous studies have quantified global exposure to extreme heat, the lack of a globally accurate, fine-resolution temporal analysis of urban exposure crucially limits our ability to deploy adaptations. Here, we estimate daily urban population exposure to extreme heat for 13,115 urban settlements from 1983 to 2016. We harmonize global, fine-resolution (0.05°), daily temperature maxima and relative humidity estimates with geolocated and longitudinal global urban population data. We measure the average annual rate of increase in exposure (person-days/year−1) at the global, regional, national, and municipality levels, separating the contribution to exposure trajectories from urban population growth versus total urban warming. Using a daily maximum wet bulb globe temperature threshold of 30 °C, global exposure increased nearly 200% from 1983 to 2016. Total urban warming elevated the annual increase in exposure by 52% compared to urban population growth alone. Exposure trajectories increased for 46% of urban settlements, which together in 2016 comprised 23% of the planet’s population (1.7 billion people). However, how total urban warming and population growth drove exposure trajectories is spatially heterogeneous. This study reinforces the importance of employing multiple extreme heat exposure metrics to identify local patterns and compare exposure trends across geographies. Our results suggest that previous research underestimates extreme heat exposure, highlighting the urgency for targeted adaptations and early warning systems to reduce harm from urban extreme heat exposure.},

   abstract = {A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 detailed illustration of the parameterization process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for predicted annual average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7°C and 1.2°C, with biases of +0.1°C and −0.1°C, respectively. MAE for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4 cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3%. The success rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3%. Particular attention was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated by the daily occurrence predictions, but very nearly the same predictions were obtained at daily and annual timesteps.},

   abstract = {Phenology is a first-order control on productivity and mediates the biophysical environment by altering albedo, surface roughness length and evapotranspiration. Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system. Here, we present the phenor r package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data. We show an example analysis, using the phenor modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework. In conclusion, we hope the phenor phenology modelling framework in the r language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.},

   abstract = {Microclimate models predict temperature and other meteorological variables at scales relevant to individual organisms. The broad application of microclimate models requires gridded macroclimatic variables as input. However, the spatial and temporal resolution of such inputs can be a limiting factor on the accuracy of microclimate predictions. Due to its fine resolution and accuracy, the ERA5 reanalysis dataset is emerging as the favoured resource for global historical weather and climate data and has great potential for aiding microclimate modelling. Here we describe mcera5, an R language package that provides convenient access to, and wrangling of, the ERA5 climate datasets for use in microclimate models. Through this package, we provide functions to query ERA5 data for desired spatial and temporal extents, to correct for spatial biases and process outputs for easy interpretation by ecologists, thereby allowing faster and more accurate microclimate predictions. By validating with empirical observations from multiple biomes globally, we demonstrate that the use of ERA5 climate forcing via mcera5 improves the prediction accuracy of soil moisture, air temperature and relative humidity as compared to forcing with other globally available data and offers comparable performance when predicting soil temperatures. Through the provision of fine-resolution ERA5 data, the mcera5 package fits into an ecosystem of tools for modelling microclimate in a spatio-temporally explicit fashion, advancing our ability to efficiently predict microclimate for any place on Earth for the past, present or future. The package also provides convenient access to ERA5 datasets for a range of other applications.},

   abstract = {Background: Heat warnings are issued in advance of forecast extreme heat events, yet little evidence is available regarding their effectiveness in reducing heat-related illness and death. We estimated the association of heat warnings and advisories (collectively, “alerts”) issued by the United States National Weather Service with all-cause mortality and cause-specific hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in 2,817 counties, 2006–2016. Methods: In each county, we compared days with heat alerts to days without heat alerts, matched on daily maximum heat index and month. We used conditional Poisson regression models stratified on county, adjusting for year, day of week, federal holidays, and lagged daily maximum heat index. Results: We identified a matched non-heat alert day for 92,029 heat alert days in 2,817 counties, or 54.6% of all heat alert days during the study period. Contrary to expectations, heat alerts were not associated with lower risk of mortality (RR: 1.005 [95% CI: 0.997, 1.013]). However, heat alerts were associated with higher risk of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders (RR: 1.040 [95% CI: 1.015, 1.065]) and heat stroke (RR: 1.094 [95% CI: 1.038, 1.152]). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses additionally adjusting for same-day heat index, ozone, and PM2.5. Conclusions: Our results suggest that heat alerts are not associated with lower risk of mortality but may be associated with higher rates of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders and heat stroke, potentially suggesting that heat alerts lead more individuals to seek or access care.},

This study aimed to evaluate the real-time health outcome of ambulance services in association with ambient temperature and mass concentrations of total PM2.5 level and constituents in Kaohsiung City, an industrialized city with the worst air quality in Taiwan. Cumulative 6-day (lag0-5) relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of daily ambulance services records of respiratory distress, coma and unconsciousness, chest pain, headaches/dizziness/vertigo/fainting/syncope, lying at public, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in association with ambient temperature and mass concentrations of total PM2.5 level and constituents (nitrate, sulfate, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC)) from 2006 to 2010 were evaluated using a distributed lag non-linear model with quasi-Poisson function. Ambulance services of chest pain and OHCA were significantly associated with extreme high (30.8 °C) and low (18.2 °C) temperatures, with cumulative 6-day RRs ranging from 1.37 to 1.67 at the reference temperature of 24–25 °C. Daily total PM2.5 level had significant effects on ambulance services of lying at public and respiratory distress. After adjusting the cumulative 6-day effects of temperature and total PM2.5 level, RRs of ambulance services of lying at public associated with constituents at 90th percentile versus 25th percentile were 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.68) for sulfate and 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.41) for EC, while RR was 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09–1.58) for ambulance services of headache/dizziness/vertigo/fainting/syncope in association with OC at 90th percentile versus 25th percentile.

Houston and other areas in Texas experienced an exceptional heat wave in the summer of 2011 producing the hottest August on record. This study aims to assess the health-related impact of this heat wave. Methods: Distributed lag models were used to estimate associations between the 2011 heat wave and all-cause mortality and emergency department (ED) visits from May 1 through September 30 for the five-year period 2007-2011. The 2011 heat wave is defined as a continuous period from August 2 through 30, 2011 according to the heat advisories issued by the local National Weather Service office, and is included in the models as a dummy variable. We compared the estimated excess risk among the models with and without adjustment of continuous temperature and ozone. Results: The 2011 heat wave in Houston was associated with a 3.6% excess risk in ED visits (95% CI: 0.6%, 6.6%) and 0.6% increase in mortality risk (95% CI: -5.5%, 7.1%). The elderly over 65 years of age were at the greatest risk in ED visits. These patterns are consistent across different heat-wave definitions, and results are similar when adjusting for continuous temperature and ozone. Conclusions: The 2011 heat wave in Houston had a substantial impact on ED visits and no significant impact on mortality. Our findings provide insights into local heat-wave and health preparations and interventions.},

Here we develop the family of distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM), a modelling framework that can simultaneously represent non-linear exposure-response dependencies and delayed effects. This methodology is based on the definition of a 'cross-basis', a bi-dimensional space of functions that describes simultaneously the shape of the relationship along both the space of the predictor and the lag dimension of its occurrence. In this way the approach provides a unified framework for a range of models that have previously been used in this setting, and new more flexible variants. This family of models is implemented in the package dlnm within the statistical environment R. To illustrate the methodology we use examples of DLNMs to represent the relationship between temperature and mortality, using data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) for New York during the period 1987-2000.

   abstract = {Extreme heat is annually the deadliest weather hazard in the United States and is strongly amplified by climate change. In Florida, summer heat waves have increased in frequency and duration, exacerbating negative human health impacts on a state with a substantial older population and industries (e.g., agriculture) that require frequent outdoor work. However, the combined impacts of temperature and humidity (heat stress) have not been previously investigated. For eight Florida cities, this study constructs summer climatologies and trend analyses (1950–2020) of two heat stress metrics: heat index (HI) and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). While both incorporate temperature and humidity, WBGT also includes wind and solar radiation and is a more comprehensive measure of heat stress on the human body. With minor exceptions, results show increases in average summer daily maximum, mean, and minimum HI and WBGT throughout Florida. Daily minimum HI and WBGT exhibit statistically significant increases at all eight stations, emphasizing a hazardous rise in nighttime heat stress. Corresponding to other recent studies, HI and WBGT increases are largest in coastal subtropical locations in central and southern Florida (i.e., Daytona Beach, Tampa, Miami, and Key West) but exhibit no conclusive relationship with urbanization changes. Danger (1038–1248F; 39.48–51.18C) HI and high (.888F; 31.18C) WBGT summer days exhibit significant frequency increases across the state. Especially at coastal locations in the Florida Peninsula and Keys, danger HI and high WBGT days now account for .20% of total summer days, emphasizing a substantial escalation in heat stress, particularly since 2000.},

We reviewed and summarized physical factors of the indoor environment reported to affect human health and wellbeing in HCFs. Altogether, 214 publications were selected for this review. According to the literature, there is strong scientific evidence to show that following indoor environmental factors have beneficial effects for all user groups when appropriately designed or implemented: the acoustic environment, ventilation and air conditioning systems, the thermal environment, the visual environment (e.g. lighting, and views of nature), ergonomic conditions and furniture. In contrast, the effect of special layouts and room type and floor coverings may be beneficial for one group and detrimental for another. Some of the physical factors may, in themselves, directly promote or hinder health and wellbeing, but the factors can also have numerous indirect impacts by influencing the behaviour, actions and interactions of patients, their families and the staff members. The findings of this research enable a good understanding of the different physical factors of the indoor environment on health and wellbeing and provide a practical resource for those responsible for the design and operation of the facilities as well as researchers investigating these factors. However, more studies are needed in order to inform the design of optimally beneficial indoor environments in HCFs for all user groups. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We measured 15 PFAS, 8 PBDEs, and 19 OPEs in dust from offices, common areas, and classrooms having undergone either no intervention (conventional rooms in older buildings meeting strict fire codes; n = 12), full “healthier” materials interventions (rooms with “healthier” materials in buildings constructed more recently or gut-renovated; n = 7), or partial interventions (other rooms with at least “healthier” foam furniture but more potential building contamination; n = 28). We also scanned all materials for bromine and phosphorus as surrogates of PBDEs and OPEs respectively, using x-ray fluorescence. In multilevel regression models, rooms with full “healthier” materials interventions had 78% lower dust levels of PFAS than rooms with no intervention (p < 0.01). Rooms with full “healthier” interventions also had 65% lower OPE levels in dust than rooms with no intervention (p < 0.01) and 45% lower PBDEs than rooms with only partial interventions (p < 0.10), adjusted for covariates related to insulation, electronics, and furniture. Bromine loadings from electronics in rooms were associated with PBDE concentrations in dust (p < 0.05), and the presence of exposed insulation was associated with OPE dust concentrations (p < 0.001). Full “healthier” materials renovations successfully reduced chemical classes in dust. Future interventions should address electronics, insulation, and building cross-contamination.},

   abstract = {<p>In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.</p>},

We evaluated the consistency of results from repeated administration of this questionnaire and between this questionnaire and other questionnaires collected from participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air). Participants reported spending most of their time inside their homes (average: 121 h/week or 72%). More than 50% of the participants reported spending no time in several of the location options, including at home outdoors, at work/volunteer/school locations indoors or outdoors, or in "other" locations outdoors. We observed consistency between self-reported time-location patterns from repeated administration of the time-location questionnaire and compared with other survey instruments. Comparisons with national cohorts demonstrated the differences in time-location patterns in the MESA Air cohort due to differences in demographics, but the data showed similar trends in patterns by age, gender, season, and employment status. This study was the first to explicitly examine the time-location patterns in an older, multiethnic population and the first to add data on Chinese participants. These data can be used to inform future epidemiological research of MESA Air and other studies that include diverse populations.},

   abstract = {The indoor micro-environment has its own pollutants and pollution levels indoors may be higher than those outdoors. This is particularly so when there are combustion processes associated with cooking heating or smoking coupled with poor ventilation. About half the world's population have to rely for cooking; and associated space heating on simple household stoves using unprocessed solid fuels that have high emission factors, with the consequence that they are exposed to high levels of health-damaging air pollutants. Cooking can produce very high concentrations of particles and biomass fuels emit hundreds of chemicals during small-scale combustion, such as in household cooking or heating stoves. Tobacco smoke may add to other biomass smoke and all these together cause considerable human ill health world-wide. Most indoor air pollutants directly affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and the severity of the effect varies according to both the intensity and the duration of exposure, and also the health status of the population exposed. The importance of this is that some members of the population may be at greater risk than others. A number of the chemicals found in the indoor environment are classed as carcinogens although at the levels found the probability that they will cause cancer is extremely low. This is not to lessen the problem. In a 1987 study, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ranked indoor air pollution fourth in cancer risk among the 13 top environmental problems analysed.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the substantial role indoor exposure has played in heat wave–related mortality, few epidemiological studies have examined the health effects of exposure to indoor heat. As a result, knowledge gaps regarding indoor heat–health thresholds, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity persist. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the role of indoor heat exposure on mortality and morbidity among the elderly (≥65 years of age) in Houston, Texas. METHODS: Mortality and emergency hospital admission data were obtained through the Texas Department of State Health Services. Summer indoor heat exposure was modeled at the U.S. Census block group (CBG) level using building energy models, outdoor weather data, and building characteristic data. Indoor heat–health associations were examined using time-stratified case-crossover models, controlling for temporal trends and meteorology, and matching on CBG of residence, year, month, and weekday of the adverse health event. Separate models were fitted for three indoor exposure metrics, for individual lag days 0–6, and for 3-d moving averages (lag 0–2). Effect measure modification was explored via stratification on individual-and area-level vulnerability factors. RESULTS: We estimated positive associations between short-term changes in indoor heat exposure and cause-specific mortality and morbidity [e.g., circulatory deaths, odds ratio per 5°C increase = 1:16 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.30)]. Associations were generally positive for earlier lag periods and weaker across later lag periods. Stratified analyses suggest stronger associations between indoor heat and emergency hospital admissions among African Americans compared with Whites. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest excess mortality among certain elderly populations in Houston who are likely exposed to high indoor heat. We developed a novel methodology to estimate indoor heat exposure that can be adapted to other U.S. locations. In locations with high air conditioning prevalence, simplified modeling approaches may adequately account for indoor heat exposure in vulnerable neighborhoods. Accounting for indoor heat exposure may improve the estimation of the total impact of heat on health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6340.},

   abstract = {The elderly population is more vulnerable to poor indoor environmental quality. They also spend a larger portion of their time indoors than the general public, further exacerbating the associated health risks. As part of a larger study which aims to understand the health risks for the elderly population resulting from extreme heat events in Houston, TX, this study gathered empirical data on thermal comfort and air quality in existing assisted living facilities and in individual homes of the elderly. We made continuous measurements of indoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and occupancy status in 25 buildings during summer months in 2016 and 2017. Then, using the measured data, we calculated the percentage of hours in which the thermal discomfort index or CO2 levels were above healthy thresholds for each site. Our results show that the indoor discomfort index and/or CO2 level exceeded the safe thresholds for at least 5% of the time in two-thirds of the buildings tested. Considering that research suggests more extreme summer weather in this region in the future, the results of this study highlight the need to consider changes in building management and occupant behavior as well as targeted improvements in the building stock to minimise adverse health impacts. In addition, the results also highlight a potential trade-off between thermal comfort and air quality in these building; air-tightening of the buildings will result in better thermal comfort at the expense of higher CO2 levels, especially in buildings with a higher number of occupants.},

Established quality assurance/quality control techniques for data processing were used and sensor data quality was evaluated by calculating data completeness and summarizing PM2.5 measurements. To evaluate outdoor sensor performance, correlation coefficients (r) and coefficients of divergence (CoD) were used to assess temporal and spatial variability of PM2.5 between sensors. PM2.5 concentrations were also compared to traffic levels to assess the sensors’ ability to detect traffic pollution. To evaluate indoor sensors, indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios during resident-reported activities were calculated and compared, and a linear mixed-effects regression model was developed to quantify the impacts of ambient air quality, microclimatic factors, and indoor human activities on indoor PM2.5. In general, indoor sensors performed more reliably than outdoor sensors (completeness: 73% versus 54%). All outdoor sensors were highly temporally correlated (r > 0.98) and spatially homogeneous (CoD<0.06). The observed I/O ratios were consistent with existing literature, and the mixed-effects model explains >85% of the variation in indoor PM2.5 levels, indicating that indoor sensors detected PM2.5 from various sources. Overall, this study finds that community-maintained sensors can effectively monitor PM2.5, with main data quality concerns resulting from outdoor sensor data incompleteness.},

Two main types of data are currently used to map stocks, night-Time lights (NTL) from Earth-observing (EO) satellites and cadastral information. We present an alternative approach for broad-scale material stock mapping based on freely available highresolution EO imagery and OpenStreetMap data. Maps of built-up surface area, building height, and building types were derived from optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 satellite data to map patterns of material stocks for Austria and Germany. Using material intensity factors, we calculated the mass of different types of buildings and infrastructures, distinguishing eight types of materials, at 10 m spatial resolution. The total mass of buildings and infrastructures in 2018 amounted to 5 Gt in Austria and 38 Gt in Germany (AT: 540 t/cap, DE: 450 t/cap). Cross-checks with independent data sources at various scales suggested that the method may yield more complete results than other data sources but could not rule out possible overestimations. The method yields thematic differentiations not possible with NTL, avoids the use of costly cadastral data, and is suitable for mapping larger areas and tracing trends over time.},

Therefore, gridded products are frequently used as the only available climate data source in peripheral regions. However, associated evaluations are commonly biased towards well observed areas and consequently, station-based datasets. As evaluations on vegetation monitoring abilities are lacking for regions with poor data availability, we analyzed the potential of several state-of-the-art climate datasets (CHIRPS, CRU, ERA5-Land, GPCC-Monitoring-Product, IMERG-GPM, MERRA-2, MODIS-MOD10A1) for assessing NDVI anomalies (MODIS-MOD13Q1) in two particularly suitable remote conservation areas. We calculated anomalies of 156 climate variables and seasonal periods during 2001–2018, correlated these with vegetation anomalies while taking the multiple comparison problem into consideration, and computed their spatial performance to derive suitable parameters. Our results showed that four datasets (MERRA-2, ERA5-Land, MOD10A1, CRU) were suitable for vegetation analysis in both regions, by showing significant correlations controlled at a false discovery rate < 5% and in more than half of the analyzed areas. Cross-validated variable selection and importance assessment based on the Boruta algorithm indicated high importance of the reanalysis datasets ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 in both areas but higher differences and variability between the regions with all other products. CHIRPS, GPCC and the bias-corrected version of MERRA-2 were unsuitable and not important in both regions. We provide evidence that reanalysis datasets are most suitable for spatiotemporally consistent environmental analysis whereas gauge- or satellite-based products and their combinations are highly variable and may not be applicable in peripheral areas.},

   abstract = {Extreme heat is already occurring more frequently and with greater intensity, with this trend predicted to continue. Exposure to extreme heat causes labor supply declines, but studies to quantify the economic effects from future climate changes are limited. In this study, we adopt two different exposure-response functions relating extreme heat to the loss of labor working minutes or labor productivity. We estimate that temperature differences between 2006 and 2016 relative to 1980–1990 led to labor losses of ~$1.7 billion annually in the USA. Under the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario, approximately 1–1.8 billion workforce hours will be lost annually in the 2050s, and 1.5–4.4 billion hours will be lost by the 2100s, depending on the exposure-response function used. The lost hours lead to an estimated $51–119 billion in losses by the 2100s, without considering future climate adaptation, demographic, employment, wage structure, or economic changes. Whereas 2006–2016 losses correspond to 0.07% of the 2016 GDP, the 2100s losses rise roughly fourfold to 0.3%, which are mainly caused by the increases of extreme heat conditions with population growth a secondary factor. With the climate change mitigation strategies of the RCP4.5 scenario, 600–2600 million hours of lost labor per year could be avoided in the 2100s, saving $20–78 billion depending on the chosen exposure-response function. We also evaluated the effect of decarbonizing the energy sector in a manner consistent with the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement, finding that these lead to ~77 million avoided lost work hours worth ~$2.5 billion annually by the 2050s with global collaboration but insignificant impacts with US action alone. Though uncertainties and limitations exist in the study, we find that extreme heat will cause large economic losses to US businesses, especially in southern states (from California to Florida), though widespread climate change mitigation has the potential to substantially reduce these losses. We find that uncertainties among the exposure-response functions used to derive the economic effects of extreme heat on labor are much larger than those from the climate models. Previous studies using only one exposure-response function may exhibit substantial biases and likely underestimate uncertainties associated with the effect of climate changes on labor.},

In contrast, HAP from space heating using solid fuels, prevalent in countries at middle or high altitudes, is less studied and missing from the GBD assessment. China is an ideal example to estimate the bias of exposure and burden of diseases assessment when space heating is neglected, considering its remarkably changing demands for heating from the north to the south and a large solid-fuel-dependent rural population. In this study, based on a meta-analysis of 27 field measurement studies in rural China, we derive the indoor PM2.5 (fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) concentration for both the heating and non-heating seasons. Combining this dataset with time-activity patterns and percentage of households using solid fuels, we assess the population-weighted annual mean exposure to PM2.5 (PWE) and the health impacts associated with HAP in mainland rural China by county for the year 2010. We find that ignoring heating impacts leads to an underestimation in PWE estimates by 38 μg/m3 for the nationwide rural population (16 to 40 as interquartile range) with substantial negative bias in northern provinces. Correspondingly, premature deaths and disability-adjusted life years will be underestimated by approximately 30 × 103 and 60 × 104 in 2010, respectively. Our study poses the need for incorporating heating effects into HAP risk assessments in China as well as globally.},

Changes in the risk of death by age group, gender, and combined cardiac-respiratory cause of death were estimated for both 1°C and 50-95th percentile increases in humidex using a generalized additive linear model. With air pollution terms in the models, relative risk (RR) point estimates narrowly exceeded 1.0 for all groups. Humidex effects were most apparent for females (RR=1.006, 95% CI=1.004-1.008 per 1°C humidex and RR=1.089, 95% CI=1.058-1.121 for 50th to 95th percentile humidex). When air pollution was omitted from the model, RR in the 50-95th percentile analysis increased less than 1.71% for all groups except females, for which RR decreased 1.42%. Differences in RR per 1°C humidex were all less than 0.12%. Confidence intervals narrowed slightly for all groups investigated.

   abstract = {Understanding space–time features of wind speed is of high interest in meteorology and several applied sciences. Accurate wind speed measurements in combination with reliable gridded products, such as reanalyses, are needed to address the main characteristics of the wind field. Hourly 10 m wind speed from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) latest reanalysis (ERA5) is compared with HadISD wind observations from 245 stations across Europe. Averaged ERA5 hourly data is able to reproduce the annual cycle of monthly wind speed in Europe. ERA5 presents slightly larger (shorter) monthly medians in winter (summer) than observations. ERA5 is compared against observations for each station using a frequency distribution-based score (score, from 0 to 1). Most of the stations exhibit hourly scores ranging from 0.8 to 0.9, indicating that ERA5 is able to reproduce the wind speed spectrum range, from light to strong relative frequencies, for any location over Europe. Ranges of mean values, variability, distribution function parameters and high or low wind thresholds frequencies are shown for this ensemble of European stations, allowing for an overall description of wind features. Generally, there is no clear relationship between scores and the variables analysed. The correlation and scores between ERA5 and HadISD is even further increased at longer time frequencies (6–24 hourly), together with centred root-mean-square error (RMSE) and standard deviation decreases. Hourly wind data from ERA5 reanalysis is, despite some shortcomings, valuable information to perform further detailed studies with a regular spatial and time wind distribution, from the climatological or renewable energy perspectives, for example.},

   abstract = {High-resolution population mapping is of high relevance for developing and implementing tailored actions in several fields: From decision making in crisis management to urban planning. Earth Observation has considerably contributed to the development of methods for disaggregating population figures with higher resolution data into fine-grained population maps. However, which method is most suitable on the basis of the available data, and how the spatial units and accuracy metrics affect the validation process is not fully known. We aim to provide recommendations to researches that attempt to produce high-resolution population maps using remote sensing and geospatial information in heterogeneous urban landscapes. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive experimental research on population disaggregation methods with thirty-six different scenarios. We combined five different top-down methods (from basic to complex, i.e., binary and categorical dasymetric, statistical, and binary and categorical hybrid approaches) on different subsets of data with diverse resolutions and degrees of availability (poor, average and rich). Then, the resulting population maps were systematically validated with a two-fold approach using six accuracy metrics. We found that when only using remotely sensed data the combination of statistical and dasymetric methods provide better results, while highly-resolved data require simpler methods. Besides, the use of at least three relative accuracy metrics is highly encouraged since the validation depends on level and method. We also analysed the behaviour of relative errors and how they are affected by the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. We hope that our recommendations save additional efforts and time in future population mapping.},

Population data are typically aggregated at census enumeration units, which can have arbitrary, temporally-evolving boundaries. Previous approaches to imperviousness-based dasymetric mapping ignore cell-level patterning of imperviousness within a spatial unit of prediction, which potentially serve as a strong indicator of population. Landscape metrics derived from imperviousness data offer a promising approach to capture these patterns. In this study, we incorporate landscape metrics derived from impervious cover percentage maps into intelligent dasymetric mapping to downscale population from census tracts to block groups in four states with varying population densities: Connecticut, South Carolina, West Virginia, and New Mexico. We compare the performance of the landscape metrics-based models against two baseline models in all four states across three different time periods. The results show that intelligent dasymetric mapping using landscape metrics generally outperforms the two baseline models. We further compare the performance of landscape metrics as an ancillary source of information for dasymetric mapping against other traditionally-used datasets (e.g., land use, roads, nighttime lights data) in three states (Connecticut, South Carolina, and New Mexico) in 2000. We find that class area, landscape shape index, and number of patches consistently achieve lower error rates than other ancillary datasets in all the three states.},

   abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is a major health hazard. The health effects of PM are closely linked to particle size, which governs its deposition in (and penetration through) the respiratory tract. In recent years, low-cost sensors that report particle concentrations for multiple-sized fractions (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10) have proliferated in everyday use and scientific research. However, knowledge of how well these sensors perform across the full range of reported particle size fractions is limited. Unfortunately, erroneous particle size data can lead to spurious conclusions about exposure, misguided interventions, and ineffectual policy decisions. We assessed the linearity, bias, and precision of three low-cost sensor models, as a function of PM size fraction, in an urban setting. Contrary to manufacturers’ claims, sensors are only accurate for the smallest size fraction (PM1). The PM1.0-2.5 and PM2.5-10 size fractions had large bias, noise, and uncertainty. These results demonstrate that low-cost aerosol sensors (1) cannot discriminate particle size accurately and (2) only report linear and precise measures of aerosol concentration in the accumulation mode size range (i.e., between 0.1 and 1 μm). We recommend that crowdsourced air quality monitoring networks stop reporting coarse (PM2.5-10) mode and PM10 mass concentrations from these sensors.},

Several adaptive comfort equations have been developed, some as part of international comfort standards and some for specific climatic regions. In the current work, an attempt was made to find a best fit among available comfort equations for predicting occupant comfort in the tropical climatic regions of India. Comfort temperatures found in surveys done across tropical India were compared to comfort temperatures computed from five different adaptive comfort equations. Additionally, to estimate energy savings possible through implementation of adaptive comfort standards, adaptive comfort degree days (ACDD) were calculated across seven Indian cities using comfort temperature predictions from the five equations. Put together, results from these two analyses showed that the comfort equation from EN15251 may be used as a reasonable predictor of comfort in naturally ventilated buildings of hot-humid Indian regions and such use would also result in major energy savings. It is proposed that till further studies in India provide more detailed results, the EN15251's standard for naturally ventilated buildings may be used as a suitable option for Indian conditions. Formalisation of appropriate adaptive comfort standards for India would be a significant asset to the sustainable development of this country.},

This paper describes effect modification of temperature in the PM(10)-mortality association and tests the hypothesis that higher PM(10) effects in summer are due to enhanced exposure to particles. All deaths of residents of nine Italian cities between 1997 and 2004 were selected. The case-crossover approach was adopted to estimate the effect of PM(10) on mortality by season and temperature level. Three strata of temperature corresponding to low, medium, and high "ventilation" were identified, and the interaction between PM(10) and temperature within each stratum was examined. Season and temperature levels strongly modified the PM(10)-mortality association: for a 10-microg/m(3) variation in PM(10), a 2.54% increase in risk of death in summer (95% confidence interval: 1.31, 3.78) compared with 0.20% (95% confidence interval: -0.08, 0.49) in winter. Analysis of the interaction between PM(10) and temperature within temperature strata resulted in positive but, in most cases, nonstatistically significant coefficients. The authors found much higher PM(10) effects on mortality during warmer days. The hypothesis that such an effect is attributable to enhanced exposure to particles in summer could not be rejected.},

Identifying susceptible populations is of particular importance given anticipated rising temperatures from climatic change. Methods We investigated heat-related mortality for three Latin American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; São Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile) using a case-crossover approach for 754 291 deaths from 1998 to 2002. We considered lagged exposures, confounding by air pollution, cause of death and susceptibilities by educational attainment, age and sex. Results: Same and previous day apparent temperature were most strongly associated with mortality risk. Effect estimates remained positive though lowered after adjustment for ozone or PM10. Susceptibility increased with age in all cities. The increase in mortality risk for those ≥65 comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of same-day apparent temperature was 2.69% (95% CI: -2.06 to 7.88%) for Santiago, 6.51% (95% CI: 3.57 - 9.52%) for São Paulo and 3.22% (95% CI: 0.93 - 5.57%) for Mexico City. Patterns of vulnerability by education and sex differed across communities. Effect estimates were higher for women than men in Mexico City, and higher for men elsewhere, although results by sex were not appreciably different for any city. In São Paulo, those with less education were more susceptible, whereas no distinct patterns by education were observed in the other cities. Conclusions: Elevated temperatures are associated with mortality risk in these Latin American cities, with the strongest associations in São Paulo, the hottest city. The elderly are an important population for targeted prevention measures, but vulnerability by sex and education differed by city. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved.},

We apply the method to the ERA5 precipitation archive and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.},

   abstract = {Fine-scale climate information is critical to understand species–climate relationships. It is usually obtained by interpolating meteorological station data or by downscaling coarse-gridded climate data. In mountain areas, however, the low station density and macroclimate variables used in coarse-gridded climate products cannot reproduce fine-scale variations caused by the complex topography and thus result in biased predictions of species responses to climate change. Here, we present an innovative method to estimate daily local air temperature at 100 m spatial resolution in the mountain region of South Tyrol (Central Alps, Italy), called the cloud-corrected model. We introduce a correction factor that couples solar radiation and cloud cover data to improve air temperature predictions. Results are compared to models that either consider elevation only (lapse-rate model) or elevation and solar radiation but not cloud cover (clear-sky model) using a set of independent meteorological stations for validation. Moreover, all models were tested to predict critical phenological stages of the climate-sensitive species Vitis vinifera. Over the vegetative period, the cloud-corrected model significantly reduced the mean absolute error of predicted temperature compared with the lapse rate and clear-sky model by 10 and 23%, respectively, and the bias by 93 and 90%, respectively. Solar radiation and cloud cover both strongly influenced local air temperature and their inclusion in temperature estimates greatly reduced systematic biases and improved predictions of important plant phenological stages by multiple days. Our method therefore provides a new way to include easily accessible topography and climate data into fine-scale temperature predictions and accounts for important climate forcing factors that otherwise are often neglected. It combines efficiency and accuracy, because it limits data requirements but still operates on an ecologically relevant spatial scale. Thus, our approach offers promising opportunities to improve the understanding of species–climate relationships, especially in regions sensitive to the effects of climate change.},

However, most applications of WBGT within the heat stress impact literature that do not use WBGT at all, but use one of the ad hoc approximations, typically the simplified WBGT (sWBGT) or the environmental stress index (ESI). Surprisingly, little is known about how well these approximations work for the global climate and climate change settings that they are being applied to. Here, we assess the bias distribution as a function of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and radiative conditions of both sWBGT and ESI relative to a well-validated, explicit physical model for WBGT developed by Liljegren, within an idealized context and the more realistic setting of ERA5 reanalysis data. sWBGT greatly overestimates heat stress in hot-humid areas. ESI has much smaller biases in the range of standard climatological conditions. Over subtropical dry regions, both metrics can substantially underestimate extreme heat. We show systematic overestimation of labor loss by sWBGT over much of the world today. We recommend discontinuing the use of sWBGT. ESI may be acceptable for assessing average heat stress or integrated impact over a long period like a year, but less suitable for health applications, extreme heat stress analysis, or as an operational index for heat warning, heatwave forecasting, or guiding activity modification at the workplace. Nevertheless, Liljegren's approach should be preferred over these ad hoc approximations and we provide a fast Python implementation to encourage its widespread use.},

   abstract = {Along with the higher demand for bias-corrected data for climate impact studies, the number of available data sets has largely increased in recent years. For instance, the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) constitutes a framework for consistently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales. These data are very attractive for any impact application since they offer worldwide bias-corrected data based on global climate models (GCMs). In a complementary way, the CORDEX initiative has incorporated experiments based on regionally downscaled bias-corrected data by means of debiasing and quantile mapping (QM) methods. In light of this situation, it is challenging to distil the most accurate and useful information for climate services, but at the same time it creates a perfect framework for intercomparison and sensitivity analyses. In the present study, the trend-preserving ISIMIP method and empirical QM are applied to climate model simulations that were carried out at different spatial resolutions (CMIP5 GCM and EURO-CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs), at approximately 150, 50 and 12&thinsp;km horizontal resolution) in order to assess the role of downscaling and bias correction in a multivariate framework. The analysis is carried out for the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a heat stress index that is commonly used in the context of working people and labour productivity. WBGT for shaded conditions depends on air temperature and dew-point temperature, which in this work are individually bias corrected prior to the index calculation. Our results show that the added value of RCMs with respect to the driving GCM is limited after bias correction. The two bias correction methods are able to adjust the central part of the WBGT distribution, but some added value of QM is found in WBGT percentiles and in the inter-variable relationships. The evaluation in present climate of such multivariate indices should be performed with caution since biases in the individual variables might compensate, thus leading to better performance for the wrong reason. Climate change projections of WBGT reveal a larger increase in summer mean heat stress for the GCM than for the RCMs, related to the well-known reduced summer warming of the EURO-CORDEX RCMs. These differences are lowered after QM, since this bias correction method modifies the change signals and brings the results for the GCM and RCMs closer to each other. We also highlight the need for large ensembles of simulations to assess the feasibility of the derived projections.},

The heat stress index [the wet-bulb black-globe temperature (WBGT)] and drought index (Keetch-Byram drought index) are calculated from climate model projections from 1950-99 and 2070-99 and compared with those calculated from observed weather data for stations across the contiguous United States. Significant increases are projected across the southern United States for the days in the high index category above 32.2°C and high drought category. The higher humidity of the southeastern United States contributes to high WBGT as well, while the air temperatures are greatest in the Southwest. The highest WBGT categories occur for the daytime maximum; however, daily minimum WBGTs in the restricting category also are projected for more than 50 days per year in the Southeast. The high drought index is projected to increase across the Great Plains and the central and southern United States, affecting wildfire risks for military and public lands, including large agricultural regions. These projected impacts can be characterized as widespread and severe for large portions of the United States, with expected impacts to military planning, public health and safety, and natural resource management.},

There are six land use classes represented in the data product: agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential-owned, residential-income, and recreational facilities, as well as complimentary uncertainty layers informing the users about quantifiable components of data uncertainty. The datasets are part of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) and enable the creation of new knowledge of long-term land use dynamics, opening novel avenues of inquiry across multiple fields of study.},

   abstract = {In the past two years, several applications of generating three-dimensional (3D) buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been made available, for instance, OSM-3D, OSM2World, OSM Building, etc. In these projects, 3D buildings are reconstructed using the buildings' footprints and information about their attributes, which are documented as tags in OSM. Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic-Cartographic Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as a simplified version of those in ATKIS data. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

   abstract = {The aim of matching spatial data at different map scales is to find corresponding objects at different levels of detail (LODs) that represent the same real-world phenomena. This is a prerequisite for integrating, evaluating and updating spatial data collected and maintained at various scales. However, matching spatial data is not straightforward due to the ambiguities caused by problems like many-to-many correspondence, non-systematic displacement and different LODs between data sets. This paper proposes an approach to matching areal objects (e.g. buildings) based on relaxation labeling techniques widely applied in pattern recognition and computer vision. The underlying idea is to utilize contextual information (quantified by compatibility coefficient) in an iterative process, where the ambiguities are reduced until a consistent matching is achieved. This paper describes (1) a domain-specific extension to previous relaxation schemes and (2) a new compatibility coefficient that exploits relative relationships between areal object pairs in spatial data. Our approach were validated through extensive experiments using building data sets at 1:10k and 1:50k as an example. Our contextual approach showed superior performance against a non-contextual approach in general and especially in ambiguous situations. The proposed approach can also be applied to matching other areal features and/or for a different scale range. © 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

In such cases, data matching is necessary for the comparison to be meaningful, and is usually performed manually at the data preparation stage. This article proposes an automated feature-based matching method specifically designed for VGI, based on a multi-stage approach that combines geometric and attribute constraints.

   abstract = {Background Recent research suggests that heat exposure may increase the risk of traumatic injuries. Published heat-related epidemiological studies have relied upon exposure data from individual weather stations. Objective To evaluate the association between heat exposure and traumatic injuries in outdoor agricultural workers exposed to ambient heat and internal heat generated by physical activity using modeled ambient exposure data. Methods A case-crossover study using time-stratified referent selection among 12,213 outdoor agricultural workers with new Washington State Fund workers' compensation traumatic injury claims between 2000 and 2012 was conducted. Maximum daily Humidex exposures, derived from modeled meteorological data, were assigned to latitudes and longitudes of injury locations on injury and referent dates. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of injury for a priori daily maximum Humidex categories. Results The mean of within-stratum (injury day and corresponding referent days) standard deviations of daily maximum Humidex was 4.8. The traumatic injury odds ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.22), 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.25), and 1.10 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.20) for daily maximum Humidex of 25-29, 30-33, and ≥34, respectively, compared to < 25, adjusted for self-reported duration of employment. Stronger associations were observed during cherry harvest duties in the June and July time period, compared to all duties over the entire study period. Conclusions Agricultural workers laboring in warm conditions are at risk for heat-related traumatic injuries. Combined heat-related illness and injury prevention efforts should be considered in high-risk populations exposed to warm ambient conditions in the setting of physical exertion.},

However, while data on horizontal patterns are abundant, they are relatively rare for vertical patterns. Here, we present global maps of 3D built-up patterns at a 1-km2 resolution for the nominal year 2015. These data are estimated using random forest models, fed with a wide range of spatial data and trained on reference data from all continents except Antarctica. Independent testing indicates that R2 values of the global models for built-up footprint, height, and volume equal 0.89, 0.73, and 0.84, respectively. Our results show that buildings worldwide are 6.16-m high on average, and total building volume is 1645 km3, which is the equivalent of a solid cube of 12 km on each side. Yet, we find large variations in 3D built-up patterns, both within and across world regions. In particular, floor space per person exceeds 200 m2 in both Oceania and North America, while it is only 29 m2 in South Asia and 38 m2 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results provide novel insights into the global distribution of 3D built-up patterns and offer new opportunities for the assessments of urban environmental impacts.

Population data used in these studies are typically aggregated at census enumeration units, which are too coarse for many applications. Accurate population downscaling methods are needed to obtain population data at finer spatial resolutions. We use a novel settlement-related database, Built-Up Property Records (BUPR) from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the United States (HISDAC-US) to downscale population from census tracts to block groups. The BUPR dataset provides the number of built-up property records for each 250-m grid at 5-year temporal resolution from 1810 to 2015 for most contiguous United States (CONUS). The ability of BUPR to downscale population from census tracts to block groups for four states, representing a range of population densities, is evaluated here by comparing against other commonly-used ancillary datasets. The BUPR-based method outperforms all other methods in all but one state with highly-incomplete BUPR. A more detailed accuracy assessment is performed by dividing each state into low, medium, and high population density categories. The BUPR method produces more accurate downscaled population estimates for low and medium categories, though its performance deteriorates in the high density category due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution. BUPR-based dasymetric mapping is subsequently applied to the CONUS and found to generalize well beyond the four comparison states with high downscaling accuracy. The long-term record of the HISDAC-US dataset enables the potential construction of fine-grained population data back to 1810.},

However, data on spatial development of cities are limited prior to 1970. Here we leverage a compilation of high-resolution spatial land use and building data to examine the evolving size and form (shape and structure) of US metropolitan areas since the early twentieth century. Our analysis of building patterns over 100 years reveals strong regularities in the development of the size and density of cities and their surroundings, regardless of timing or location of development. At the same time, we find that trajectories regarding shape and structure are harder to codify and more complex. We conclude that these discrepant developments of urban size- and form-related characteristics are driven, in part, by the long-term decoupling of these two sets of attributes over time.},

The most commonly used subcounty geographical unit for social research in the United States is the census tract. However, the changing geometries and historically incomplete coverage of tracts present significant obstacles for longitudinal analysis that existing datasets do not sufficiently address. Overcoming these barriers, we provide housing unit estimates in consistent 2010 tract boundaries for every census year from 1940 to 2010 plus 2019 for the entire continental US. Moreover, we develop an “urbanization year” indicator that denotes if and when tracts became “urbanized” during this timeframe. We produce these data by blending existing interpolation techniques with a novel procedure we call “maximum reabsorption.” Conducting out-of-sample validation, we find that our hybrid approach generally produces more reliable estimates than existing alternatives. The final dataset, Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization Database 2010 (HHUUD10), has myriad potential uses for research involving housing, population, and land-use change, as well as (sub)urbanization.},

Despite being enormous in the aggregate, potential losses due to SLR depend on mitigation, adaptation, and exposure and are highly uneven in their distribution across coastal cities. We provide the first analysis of how changes in exposure (how and when) have unfolded over more than a century of coastal urban development in the United States. We do so by leveraging new historical settlement layers from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns within and between the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early twentieth century. Our analysis reveals that SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than non-coastal, urban, and inland areas. These patterns are particularly prominent in locations affected by hurricanes. However, density levels in historically less-developed coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones, many of which have reached building saturation. These "saturation effects"suggest that adaptation polices targeting existing buildings and developed areas are likely to grow in importance relative to the protection of previously undeveloped land.},

   abstract = {Serious concerns about global warming have been translated into urgent calls for increasing urban densities, as higher densities are associated with lower carbon emissions from both vehicles and buildings. However, attempts at effective densification have generally failed and urban densities continue to decline in cities across the world. Calls for densification without making room for it have resulted in serious housing supply bottlenecks in many cities and have rendered their housing unaffordable. If affordable densification is to be successful, it is necessary to understand the factors that constitute urban density. A novel way is presented for factoring the average density of cities into constituent factors— three or seven factors—that when multiplied together reconstitute urban density. This factoring methodology is presented together with the preliminary measurement of these factors in 10 cities in 10 world regions. This approach allows, for the first time, a clear understanding of how different cities acquire their density: Hong Kong gets its density from building height; Kinshasa from crowding; and Dhaka and Bogotá from residential coverage. This anatomy of density offers a new outline for a comprehensive strategy for city densification: one that addresses each and every one of the factors that constitute urban density. PRACTICE RELEVANCE Urban density is usually defined as the ratio of the total population of a city and its total area. This is the most appropriate single metric for measuring progress in densification in cities and is now a central objective of the global climate change agenda. However, this metric is rather crude and often hides more than it reveals. The anatomy of density offers a new, simple method for factoring urban density into its constituent factors that when multiplied together reconstitute urban density. This approach offers city leaders and urban planners a new way to consider and develop comprehensive policy options and strategies for city densification that addresses each and every one of the factors that constitute urban density and the tradeoffs between them.},

Methods: The data on 3,189,790 all-cause deaths (including 3,134,137 non-COVID-19 deaths) and meteorological conditions in 107 Italian provinces between February 1st and November 30th in each year of 2015–2020 were collected. We employed a time-stratified case-crossover study design combined with the distributed lag non-linear model to investigate the relationships of temperature with all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic and non-pandemic periods. Results: Cold temperature exposure contributed higher risks for both all-cause and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic period in 2020 than in 2015–2019. However, no different change was found for the impacts of heat. The relative risk (RR) of non-COVID-19 deaths and all-cause mortality at extremely cold (2 °C) in comparison with the estimated minimum mortality temperature (19 °C) in 2020 were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.55–1.72) and 1.45 (95%CI: 1.31–1.61) respectively, which were higher than all-cause mortality risk in 2015–2019 with RR of 1.19 (95%CI: 1.17–1.21).

   abstract = {Large-scale anthropogenic changes to the natural environment, including land-use change, climate change, and the deterioration of ecosystem services, are all accelerating. These changes are interacting to generate five major emerging public health threats that endanger the health and well-being of hundreds of millions of people. These threats include increasing exposure to infectious disease, water scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters, and population displacement. Taken together, they may represent the greatest public health challenge humanity has faced. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of each of these threats: the complex interplay of factors that generate them, the characteristics of populations that make them particularly vulnerable, and the identification of which populations are at greatest risk from each of these threats. Such improved understanding would be the basis for stepped-up efforts at modeling and mapping global vulnerability to each of these threats. It would also help natural resource managers and policy makers to estimate the health impacts associated with their decisions and would allow aid organizations to target their resources more effectively.

   abstract = {Heat waves can be lethal and routinely prompt public warnings about the dangers of heat. With climate change, extreme heat events will become more frequent and intense. However, little is known about public awareness of heat warnings or behaviors during hot weather. Awareness of heat warnings, prevention behaviors, and air conditioning (AC) prevalence and use in New York City were assessed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A random sample telephone survey was conducted in September 2011 among 719 adults and follow-up focus groups were held in winter 2012 among seniors and potential senior caregivers. During summer 2011, 79 % of adults heard or saw a heat warning. Of the 24 % who were seniors or in fair or poor health, 34 % did not own AC or never/rarely used it on hot days. Of this subgroup, 30 % were unaware of warnings, and 49 % stay home during hot weather. Reasons for not using AC during hot weather include disliking AC (29 %), not feeling hot (19 %), and a preference for fans (18 %). Seniors in the focus groups did not perceive themselves to be at risk, and often did not identify AC as an important health protection strategy. While heat warnings are received by most New Yorkers, AC cost, risk perception problems, and a preference for staying home leave many at risk during heat waves. Improving AC access and risk communications will help better protect the most vulnerable during heat waves. © 2013 The Author(s).},

   abstract = {As the physical consequences of accidental falls in the elderly are well-researched, the long-term associations between falls and quality of life and related concepts are less known. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the long-term relations between falls and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life satisfaction (LS) over six years in the general elderly population.One thousand three hundred and twenty-one subjects (aged 60-93 years), from the general population in the south of Sweden, were included in a baseline assessment and a follow-up after six years. HRQoL was measured with the SF-12 and LS with the life satisfaction index A (LSI-A). The differences in mean scores between fallers at baseline (n= 113) and non-fallers were statistical analyzed. Furthermore, the prediction of falls on the outcomes was analyzed using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for multiple confounding factors.Fallers scored significant lower in HRQoL and LS at baseline and after six years, compared to non-fallers, especially in the SF-12 physical component (p= <0.001). In the linear regression analysis, one or more falls at the baseline predicted a significant reduction in the SF-12 physical component at the follow-up assessment (B-Coefficient -1.8, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.2). In conclusion, falls predict a long-term reduction in the physical component of HRQoL in the general elderly population. Over six years, fallers had a notable chronic lowered score in both HRQoL and LS, compared to non-fallers. This long-term depression of elderly fallers in these aspects may be more extent than previous assumed. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

All the French regions were affected by this heat wave, which resulted in an excess of 14 800 deaths between 1 and 20 August. The increase in the number of excess deaths followed the same pattern as the increase in temperatures. No deviance from the normal death rate was observed in the month of August during the last third of the month, nor during the following three months. There was a clear discrepancy in the impact of the heat wave from city to city. If the effect of duration of consecutive days with high minimal temperatures and deviance with the seasonal normal temperature was patent, this could not explain all of the observed variability of the death incidence. The victims were mainly elderly women older than 75 years. In terms of relative risk and contribution to the global toll, deaths linked to heat were the most important. Based on these results, the French government developed a Heat Health Watch Warning System and set up a preventive action plan for each region in 2004.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of short-term heat stress on physical functioning in persons with MS. Twenty-three heat-sensitive MS subjects and 19 healthy controls participated. Moderate heat exposure took place in a dry Finnish sauna. Measures of upper and lower extremity function, static and dynamic balance, and walking capacity were applied. Core body temperature was measured by a telemetric physiological monitoring system. Assessments were conducted before, immediately, 1 hour, and 1 day after the heat exposure. Subjects with MS showed a significantly (P = 0.002) higher core body temperature than the controls following the heat stress. Performances in walking (P < 0.001), chair rise (P = 0.005) and functional reach (P = 0.04) were poorer in MS subjects than in controls immediately after the heat. No prolonged heat effects were observed. An increase in ambient temperature causes a higher core body temperature rise in MS subjects than in healthy controls. This rise in temperature is associated with acute, but not prolonged detrimental effects on physical functioning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Empirical evidence suggests that the effects of anthropogenic climate change, and heat in particular, could have a significant impact on mental health. This article investigates the correlation between heatwaves and/or relative humidity and suicide (fatal intentional self-harm) on a global scale. The covariance between heat/humidity and suicide was modelled using a negative binomial Poisson regression with data from 60 countries between 1979–2016. Statistically significant increases and decreases in suicide were found, as well as many cases with no significant correlation. We found that relative humidity showed a more significant correlation with suicide compared to heatwaves and that both younger age groups and women seemed to be more significantly affected by changes in humidity and heatwave counts in comparison with the rest of the population. Further research is needed to provide a larger and more consistent basis for epidemiological studies; to understand better the connections among heat, humidity and mental health; and to explore in more detail which population groups are particularly impacted and why.},

   abstract = {Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the mental health effects of high ambient temperatures and heat waves, determine whether heat-related morbidity and mortality are increased among people with known mental disorders and identify knowledge gaps to inform targeting of future research. Study design: Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Methods: A systematic review of published literature using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO without geographical or temporal limits was conducted. We included studies that explicitly linked high ambient temperatures and/or heat waves to mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using a National Institute of Health framework. Results: A total of 35 studies were included in the review, among which 34 were observational studies and one was a case–control study. Six broad mental health outcome categories were identified: suicide and heat; bipolar disorder, mania and depression and heat; schizophrenia and heat; organic mental health outcomes and heat including dementia; alcohol and substance misuse and heat; and multiple mental health outcomes/mental health service usage and heat. The studies included were heterogeneous in terms of study design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location making meta-analysis unfeasible. Fifteen studies showed an increased suicide risk with heat (relative risk [RR] 1.014–1.37 per 1 °C, P < 0.05; r = 0.10–0.64, P < 0.05). Increased risks of mental health-related admissions and emergency department visits at higher temperatures were also found. No evidence of change in community care use was found. Evidence for the impact of heat on other mental health outcomes was mixed. Conclusions: High ambient temperatures have a range of mental health effects. The strongest evidence was found for increased suicide risk. Limited evidence was found for an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality among people with known mental health problems. Knowledge gaps exist on the impact of high temperatures on many common mental health disorders. Mental health impacts should be incorporated into plans for the public health response to high temperatures, and as evidence evolves, psychological morbidity and mortality temperature thresholds should be incorporated into hot weather–warning systems.},

   abstract = {Mortality increases during periods of elevated heat. Identification of vulnerable subgroups by demographics, causes of death, and geographic regions, including deaths occurring at home, is needed to inform public health prevention efforts. We calculated mortality relative risks (RRs) and excess deaths associated with a large-scale California heat wave in 2006, comparing deaths during the heat wave with reference days. For total (all-place) and at-home mortality, we examined risks by demographic factors, internal and external causes of death, and building climate zones. During the heat wave, 582 excess deaths occurred, a 5% increase over expected (RR = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.08). Sixty-six percent of excess deaths were at home (RR = 1.12, CI 1.07–1.16). Total mortality risk was higher among those aged 35–44 years than ≥65, and among Hispanics than whites. Deaths from external causes increased more sharply (RR = 1.18, CI 1.10–1.27) than from internal causes (RR = 1.04, CI 1.02–1.07). Geographically, risk varied by building climate zone; the highest risks of at-home death occurred in the northernmost coastal zone (RR = 1.58, CI 1.01–2.48) and the southernmost zone of California’s Central Valley (RR = 1.43, CI 1.21–1.68). Heat wave mortality risk varied across subpopulations, and some patterns of vulnerability differed from those previously identified. Public health efforts should also address at-home mortality, non-elderly adults, external causes, and at-risk geographic regions.},

The health impacts of this heatwave included an almost 14-fold increase in direct heat-related hospital admissions. This study aims to investigate the risk factors for this extra health burden. A case crossover study was conducted in metropolitan Adelaide to compare the characteristics of patients from the heatwave (exposure) period and non-heatwave (control) periods before and after. Direct heat-related hospitalizations were identified based on the ICD-10 codes (X30, T67, and E86). Patients' data, including age, gender, indicators of health status, living conditions and socio-economic status, were collected from the South Australian Department of Health and patients' case-notes from seven major Adelaide hospitals. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to estimate the odd ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results indicate that living at residential aged care (OR=0.41, 95% CI: 0.15-0.70) and having higher number of co-morbidities (OR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.83-0.95) reduced the risk of hospital admission for direct heat-related illnesses during the heatwave, while having renal problems (OR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.07-2.94), reporting a fall prior to hospitalization (OR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.10-3.77), receiving assistance from community (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.24-4.30), living alone (OR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.32-4.40), socio-economic disadvantage (OR=2.10, 95% CI: 1.09-4.04) and no private health insurance (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.05-3.16) increased the risk. In conclusion, the people most at risk during the 2009 heatwave in Adelaide were those who lived alone, received help from community services, with co-existing renal problems or a risk of falls, and with a lower socio-economic status.

   abstract = {Introduction: France was affected in early August 2003 by a heat wave with an exceptional health impact. Many studies on mortality were conducted but few data are available on morbidity. The objectives of this study were to describe the impact of the 2003 heat wave in the general population of elderly people and to determine individual factors associated with morbidity. Methods: A cross-sectional study nested in two prospective cohorts, the PAQUID and the Three-City (3C) studies, was performed. The sample included 2295 subjects from the general population, aged 67 and over who were interviewed by a phone questionnaire to complete data available in the database of the two cohorts. Two variables assessing morbidity (felt by the person and objectively observed) were created. Relationship between morbidity and individual factors were explored in univariate analyses; then multiple logistic regressions were conducted. Results: During the heat wave, 8.8% of the subjects felt a deterioration of their health, and 7.8% declared an objective morbid outcome. In the univariate analyses, many factors were associated with morbidity. After multiple adjustments, few associations were still observed but some factors were associated with a decreased risk (presence of a bathroom, dressing lighter than usually) or an increased risk (stopping usual activities, presence of chronic diseases). Conclusion: This study showed a non-negligible impact of the 2003 heat wave in term of felt and objective morbidity. Several individual factors were shown to be associated with morbidity and should be taken into account for the elaboration of prevention plans. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION Heat illness among the UK Armed Forces is usually exertional, and therefore preventable, yet the incidence has not reduced since 2011. JSP 539 explicitly states that wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) should be measured 'at the location of greatest heat risk', not 'that of most convenience'. A handheld WBGT tracker used at point-of-exertion could reduce this incidence if proven to be as accurate as the current in-service device. METHODS Longitudinal observational comparison and equipment feasibility study of the Kestrel 5400 and QUESTemp 34 (QT-34) in worldwide firm base and deployed UK Armed Forces locations. The locations chosen were Kenya, South Sudan, Belize, Tidworth, Aldershot and Brecon. Paired data points of WBGT readings were collected from November 2017 to August 2018 in all weather conditions. RESULTS WBGT readings were comparable between the QT-34 and Kestrel 5400 across the UK and overseas. In addition, there was no change in accuracy between readings taken from the Kestrel 5400 when tripod-mounted and handheld. The Kestrel was easy to set up and far less susceptible to resupply or power supply limitations, as it requires no user input for wet bulb temperature, and runs on AA batteries. CONCLUSION This equipment feasibility study has shown that the Kestrel 5400 gives an acceptable accuracy and is easier to use than the QT-34. The authors recommend that the Kestrel 5400 is introduced as an adjunct to the QT-34, and its use within the military setting monitored through ongoing comparative data collection in a large-scale proof-of-concept study.},

   abstract = {Municipalities use Heat Vulnerability Indices (HVIs) to quantify and map relative distribution of risks to human health in the event of a heatwave. These maps ostensibly allow public agencies to identify the highest-risk neighborhoods, and to concentrate emergency planning efforts and resources accordingly (e.g., to establish the locations of cooling centers). The method of constructing an HVI varies by municipality, but common inputs include demographic variables such as age and income – and to some extent, metrics such as land cover. However, taking demographic data as a proxy for heat vulnerability may provide an incomplete or inaccurate assessment of risk. A critical limitation in HVIs may be a lack of focus on housing characteristics and how they mediate indoor heat exposure. To provide an objective assessment of this limitation, we first reviewed HVIs in the literature and those published or commissioned by municipalities. We subsequently verified that most of these HVIs excluded housing factors. Next, to scope the potential consequences, we used physics-based simulations of housing prototypes (46,000 housing permutations per city) to estimate the variation in indoor heat exposure within high-vulnerability neighborhoods in Boston and Phoenix. The results show that by excluding building-level determinants of exposure, HVIs fail to capture important components of heat vulnerability. Moreover, we demonstrate how these maps currently overlook important nuances regarding the impact of building age and air conditioning functionality. Finally, we discuss the challenges of implementing housing stock characteristics in HVIs and propose methods for overcoming these challenges.},

However, the information of urban building height over large areas is still limited due to the lack of available data. In this study, we developed an approach to estimate building height using the Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected data. First, we proposed an indicator of VVH that integrates the dual-polarization information (i.e., VV and VH) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Second, we developed a building height model using the indicator of VVH and the reference building height from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images in seven cities in the United States (US). Third, we estimated building height of major cities with area larger than 500 km2 in the US using the developed model. The root mean square error between estimated and reference height is 1.5 m in seven study cities in the US. The comparison with the Laser observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite data in available footprints also indicates that the estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data is reliable. The estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data shows a better agreement with the reference data compared to the Advanced Land Observing Satellite data in seven US cities. Our results of building height in major US cities indicate that there are more cities with tall buildings in the Northeastern US compared to the Western and Southern US, with more aggregated tall buildings in central business districts of cities. The information of building height from this study is of great value in urban studies, such as estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban areas.},

   abstract = {Although the scale of impending urbanization is well-acknowledged, we have a limited understanding of how urban forms will change and what their impact will be on building energy use. Using both top-down and bottom-up approaches and scenarios, we examine building energy use for heating and cooling. Globally, the energy use for heating and cooling by the middle of the century will be between 45 and 59 exajoules per year (corresponding to an increase of 7–40% since 2010). Most of this variability is due to the uncertainty in future urban densities of rapidly growing cities in Asia and particularly China. Dense urban development leads to less urban energy use overall. Waiting to retrofit the existing built environment until markets are ready in about 5 years to widely deploy the most advanced renovation technologies leads to more savings in building energy use. Potential for savings in energy use is greatest in China when coupled with efficiency gains. Advanced efficiency makes the least difference compared with the business-as-usual scenario in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa but significantly contributes to energy savings in North America and Europe. Systemic efforts that focus on both urban form, of which urban density is an indicator, and energy-efficient technologies, but that also account for potential co-benefits and trade-offs with human well-being can contribute to both local and global sustainability. Particularly in growing cities in the developing world, such efforts can improve the well-being of billions of urban residents and contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing energy use in urban areas.},

   abstract = {Although the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the NASA Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite was not designed for urban applications, its 3-D measurement capability over the globe makes it a nice feature for consideration in monitoring urban heights. However, this has not been previously done. In this paper, we report some preliminary assessment of the GLAS data for building height and density estimation in a suburb of Beijing, China. Building heights can be directly calculated from a GLAS data product (GLA14). Because GLA14 limits height levels to six in each ground footprint, we developed a new method to remove this restriction by processing the raw GLAS data. The maximum heights measured in the field at selected GLAS footprints were used to validate the GLAS measurement results. By assuming a constant incident energy and surface reflectance within a GLAS footprint, the building density can be estimated from GLA14 or from our newly processed GLAS data. The building density determined from high-resolution images in Google Earth was used to validate the GLAS estimation results. The results indicate that the newly developed method can produce more accurate building height estimation within each GLAS footprint ( R2 = 0.937, rmse = 6.4 m, and n = 26) than the GLA14 data product (R2 = 0.808, rmse = 11.5m, and n = 26). However, satisfactory estimation results on building density cannot be obtained from the GLAS data with the methods investigated in this paper. Forest cover could be a challenge to building height and density estimation from the GLAS data. It should be addressed in future research. © 2006 IEEE.},

Among them, mobility infrastructure, particularly public transport (PT), is of pivotal significance due to its intermediary role in access to other amenities such as healthcare or urban green space (UGS). Given this, the inequity in access to PT could lead to more adverse impacts on society, especially if it coincides with inequities in other amenities. In response, we calculate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) between the elderly population and urban amenities of PT, healthcare, and UGS at the suburban level of Melbourne Metropolitan. We, then, introduce and develop a LISA-on-LISA model to analyze and reveal the coexistence of inequities at the suburban level. The results evidence the existence of inequity in access to PT for elderly cohorts. We further reveal the clusters of PT inequity which are, at the same time, experiencing healthcare and UGS inequities. The implications of the study for resource allocation and distribution in areas suffering from simultaneous inequity are discussed.},

   abstract = {Purpose: Rural residents may have lower access to and use of certain health information sources relative to urban residents. We investigated differences in information source access and use between rural and urban US adults and whether having low health literacy might exacerbate rural disparities in access to and use of health information. Methods: Six hundred participants (50% rural) completed an online survey about access and use of 25 health information sources. We used logistic regression models to test associations between rurality and access to and use of health information sources and whether rurality interacted with health literacy to predict the access and use. Findings: Compared to urban residents, rural residents had lower access to health information from sources including primary care providers, specialist doctors, blogs, and magazines, and less use of search engines. After accounting for sociodemographics, rural residents only had lower access to specialist doctors than urban residents. Rural residents with limited health literacy had lower access to mass media and scientific literature but higher use of corporations/companies than rural residents with adequate health literacy and urban residents regardless of health literacy level. Conclusions: Some differences in access to and use of health information sources may be accounted for by sociodemographic differences between rural and urban populations. There may be structural barriers such as shortage of specialist doctors and limited media exposure that make it harder for rural residents to access health information, especially those with limited health literacy.},

   abstract = {One challenge to achieving Millennium Development Goals was inequitable access to quality health services. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, interventions need to reach underserved populations. Analyzing health indicators in small geographic units aids the identification of hotspots where coverage lags behind neighboring areas. The purpose of these analyses is to identify areas of low coverage or high need in order to inform effective resource allocation to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. Using data from The Demographic and Health Survey Program surveys conducted in 27 selected African countries between 2010 and 2014, we computed estimates for six child health indicators for subnational regions. We calculated Global Moran’s I statistics and used Local Indicator of Spatial Association analysis to produce a spatial layer showing spatial associations. We created maps to visualize sub-national autocorrelation and spatial clusters. The Global Moran’s I statistic was positive for each indicator (range: 0.41 to 0.68), and statistically significant (p <0.05), suggesting spatial autocorrelation across national borders, and highlighting the need to examine health indicators both across countries and within them. Patterns of substantial differences among contiguous subareas were apparent; the average intra-country difference for each indicator exceeded 20 percentage points. Clusters of cross-border associations were also apparent, facilitating the identification of hotspots and informing the allocation of resources to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. This study exposes differences in health indicators in contiguous geographic areas, indicating that specific regional and subnational, in addition to national, strategies to improve health and reduce health inequalities are warranted.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To examine how redlining, a historical racially discriminatory housing policy implemented by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), is associated with current neighborhood determinants of health in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Methods. We analyzed associations between census tract‒level HOLC color grades (red = "hazardous"; yellow = "declining"; blue = "desirable"; and green = "best") and a developed neighborhood determinants of health index (DOHI) consisting of 8 indicators of economic, social, governance, and physical environment characteristics using spatial regression analysis and controlling for change in the census tract's percentage of White residents. Results. A total of 484 Detroit Metropolitan Area census tracts had HOLC grades. The mean redlining score across all census tracts was 3.02 (min = 1.0; max = 4.0). The mean contemporary DOHI was 19.11 (min = 8.0; max = 36.0). Regression models show significantly higher DOHI scores in yellowlined (b = 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 3.91), bluelined (b = 5.33; 95% CI = 3.65, 7.01), and greenlined (b = 9.25; 95% CI = 6.86, 11.64) neighborhoods compared with redlined neighborhoods. Conclusions. Historical redlined neighborhoods experience contemporary determinants of health conditions that are less conducive to health compared with those in nonredlined neighborhoods. These differences also reflect the accumulation of resources essential for health in greenlined neighborhoods. Public Health Implications. Neighborhood development initiatives should consider the impacts of historical redlining on contemporary neighborhood conditions.

Rural populations have different characteristics that are typically a direct result of "rurality"-i.e., long distances and low population density. Jobs that require a high-density population (such as a professional hockey player) are not available to individuals who live at a distance from a metro center. Rural Canada may have an agricultural landscape (or a forestry or mining landscape) but the vast majority of rural workers do not work in primary sectors. Manufacturing employment is larger. Rural Canada is competitive in manufacturing-rural areas are gaining a larger share of Canada's manufacturing workforce. Rural incomes are lower, on average. But lower living costs mean that the rural incidence of low incomes is similar to urban. In rural communities, the existence of social networks does not always imply that these networks are used. Networks are complementary-one network does not always substitute for another. However, local strength in one network can be used to build capacity in another network.},

Stringency is substantial when regulated heights are far below free-market heights, while stringency is lower when the two values are closer. Using FAR (the floor-area ratio) as a height index, theory shows that the elasticity of the land price with respect to FAR is a proper stringency measure. This elasticity is estimated for five US cities by combining CoStar land-sales data with FAR values from local zoning maps, and the results show that New York and Washington, D.C., have stringent height regulations, while Chicago’s and San Francisco’s regulations are less stringent (Boston represents an intermediate case). The paper also provides evidence on stringency variation within the cities.},

The cross-validation results indicated that the proposed Si-GPR model overall achieved considerable estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 4.22 m) across the entire country. Because of the implementation of local modelling, the spatially-explicit GPR outperformed (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.82 m) the spatially-implicit GPR (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 6.46 m) for all low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise buildings.

   abstract = {Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.},

Experiments were carried out using a dataset of 100k satellite images across Africa containing 1.75M manually labelled building instances, and further datasets for pre-training and self-training. We report novel methods for improving performance of building detection with this type of model, including the use of mixup (mAP +0.12) and self-training with soft KL loss (mAP +0.06).

   abstract = {The estimation of the vertical components of built-up areas from free Digital Elevation Model (DEM) global data filtered by multi-scale convolutional, morphological and textural transforms are generalized at the spatial resolution of 250 meters using linear least-squares regression techniques. Six test cases were selected: Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Toronto. Five global DEM and two DEM composites are evaluated in terms of 60 combinations of linear, morphological and textural filtering and different generalization techniques. Four generalized vertical components estimates of built-up areas are introduced: the Average Gross Building Height (AGBH), the Average Net Building Height (ANBH), the Standard Deviation of Gross Building Height (SGBH), and the Standard Deviation of Net Building Height (SNBH). The study shows that the best estimation of the net GVC of built-up areas given by the ANBH and SNBH, always contains a greater error than their corresponding gross GVC estimation given by the AGBH and SGBH, both in terms of mean and standard deviation. Among the sources evaluated in this study, the best DEM source for estimating the GVC of built-up areas with univariate linear regression techniques is a composite of the 1-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM30) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) using the union operator (CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U). A multivariate linear model was developed using 16 satellite features extracted from the CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U enriched by other land cover sources, to estimate the gross GVC. A RMSE of 2.40 m and 3.25 m was obtained for the AGBH and the SGBH, respectively. A similar multivariate linear model was developed to estimate the net GVC. A RMSE of 6.63 m and 4.38 m was obtained for the ANBH and the SNBH, respectively. The main limiting factors on the use of the available global DEMs for estimating the GVC of built-up areas are two. First, the horizontal resolution of these sources (circa 30 and 90 meters) corresponds to a sampling size that is larger than the expected average horizontal size of built-up structures as detected from nadir-angle Earth Observation (EO) data, producing more reliable estimates for gross vertical components than for net vertical component of built-up areas. Second, post-production processing targeting Digital Terrain Model specifications may purposely filter out the information on the vertical component of built-up areas that are contained in the global DEMs. Under the limitations of the study presented here, these results show a potential for using global DEM sources in order to derive statistically generalized parameters describing the vertical characteristics of built-up areas, at the scale of 250x250 meters. However, estimates need to be evaluated in terms of the specific requirements of target applications such as spatial population modelling, urban morphology, climate studies and so on.},

   abstract = {Background: A critical adaptation strategy for reducing heat-related health risk under climate change is to establish a heat warning system with a proper threshold that requires evaluation of heat-health relationships using empirical data. Objectives: This work presents a new approach to selecting proper health-based thresholds for a heat warning system which are different from thresholds of heat-health relationship. Methods: The proposed approach examined heat-health relationships through analyzing 15 years of health records with a modified generalized additive model (GAM), compared risk ratio increments (RRIs) of threshold candidates against a reference, assessed frequency of days above these candidates, and presented results graphically for easy communication. The candidate with the maximum RRI and proper occurring frequency is potentially the best threshold. Three heat indicators, including wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), temperature (T), and apparent temperature (AT), as well as three health outcomes, including all-cause mortality, heat-related hospital admissions, and heat-related emergency visits were evaluated. Results: Risk ratios for all three health outcomes showed a consistent rising trend with increasing threshold candidates for all three heat indicators among different age and gender groups. WBGT had the most obvious increasing trend of RRIs with the three health outcomes. The maximum RRI was observed in heat-related emergency visits (242%), followed by heat-related hospital admissions (73%), and all-cause mortality (9%). The RRIs assessed for the three health outcomes pointed to the same thresholds, 33.0 °C, 34.0 °C, and 37.5 °C for WBGT, T, and AT, respectively. The number of days above these thresholds and for warning to be issued ranged between 0 and 7 days during 2000–2014. Discussion: This study demonstrated a new approach to determining heat-warning thresholds with different heat indicators and health outcomes. The proposed approach provides a straightforward, feasible, and flexible scientific tool that assists the authorities around the world in selecting a proper threshold for a heat warning system.},

   abstract = {Background: The earth's climate is warming and the frequency, duration, and severity of heat waves are increasing. Meanwhile, the world's population is rapidly aging. Epidemiological data demonstrate exponentially greater increases in morbidity and mortality during heat waves in adults ≥65 years. Laboratory data substantiate the mechanistic underpinnings of age-associated differences in thermoregulatory function. However, the specific combinations of environmental conditions (i.e., ambient temperature and absolute/relative humidity) above which older adults are at increased risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality are less clear. Methods: This review was conducted to (1) examine the recent (past 3 years) literature regarding heat-related morbidity and mortality in the elderly and discuss projections of future heat-related morbidity and mortality based on climate model data, and (2) detail the background and unique methodology of our ongoing laboratory-based projects aimed toward identifying the specific environmental conditions that result in elevated risk of heat illness in older adults, and the implications of using the data toward the development of evidence-based safety interventions in a continually-warming climate (PSU HEAT; Human Environmental Age Thresholds). Results: The recent literature demonstrates that extreme heat continues to be increasingly detrimental to the health of the elderly and that this is apparent across the world, although the specific environmental conditions above which older adults are at increased risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality remain unclear. Conclusion: Characterizing the environmental conditions above which risk of heat-related illnesses increase remains critical to enact policy decisions and mitigation efforts to protect vulnerable people during extreme heat events.},

   abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify the major heat waves (HW) that occurred in France from 1971 to 2003 and describe their impact on all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Heat waves were defined as periods of at least three consecutive days when the maximum and the minimum temperature, averaged over the whole France, were simultaneously greater than their respective 95th percentile. The underlying causes of death were regrouped into 18 categories. Heatstroke, hyperthermia and dehydration were assigned to the “heat-related causes” (HRC) category. The numbers of deaths observed (O) during the identified HW were compared to those expected (E) on the basis of the mortality rates reported for the three preceding years. Six HW were identified from the period 1971 to 2003. They were associated with great excess mortality (from 1,300 to 13,700 deaths). The observations are compatible with a moderate harvesting effect for four of the six HW. The mortality ratios increased with age for subjects aged over 55&nbsp;years and were higher for women than for men over 75&nbsp;years. For the six HW, the excess mortality was significant for almost all the causes of death: (1) the greatest excess mortality (O–E) were observed for cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, HRC, ill-defined conditions and injury and poisoning, and (2) the mortality ratios (O/E) were highest for HRC, respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, mental disorders, infectious diseases, and endocrine and nutritional diseases. Heat waves associated with excess mortality are not rare events in this temperate-climate country. The excess mortality is much greater than HRC mortality. Some populations are particularly vulnerable to HW: the elderly, women and people with some specific diseases. However, no segment of the population may be considered protected from the risks associated with HW.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Due to climate change, the frequency, intensity and severity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold waves, storms, heavy precipitation causing wildfires, floods, and droughts are increasing, which could adversely affect human health. The purpose of this systematic review is therefore to assess the current literature about the association between these extreme weather events and their impact on the health of the European population. 

METHODS
Observational studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 17, 2020 on health effects of extreme weather events in Europe were searched systematically in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The exposures of interest included extreme temperature, heat waves, cold waves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires. The health impacts included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, respiratory mortality and morbidity, and mental health. We conducted the systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the NICE quality appraisal checklist (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence). 

RESULTS
The search yielded 1472 articles, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Studies regarding five extreme weather events (extreme heat events, extreme cold events, wildfires, floods, droughts) were found. A positive association between extreme heat/cold events and overall, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was reported from most studies. Wildfires are likely to increase the overall and cardiovascular mortality. Floods might be associated with the deterioration of mental health instead of mortality. Depending on their length, droughts could have an influence on both respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Contradictory evidence was found in heat-associated morbidity and wildfire-associated respiratory mortality. The associations are inconclusive due to the heterogeneous study designs, study quality, exposure and outcome assessment. 

CONCLUSIONS
Evidence from most of the included studies showed that extreme heat and cold events, droughts, wildfires and floods in Europe have negative impacts on human health including mental health, although some of the associations are not conclusive. Additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results and further studies regarding the effects of other extreme weather events in Europe are to be expected.},

   abstract = {Aside from climatic factors, the impact of heat waves on mortality depends on the demographic and socio-economic structure of the population as well as variables relating to local housing. Hence, this study’s main aim was to ascertain whether there might be a differential impact of heat waves on daily mortality by area of residence. The study is a time-series analysis (2000–2009) of daily mortality and minimum and maximum daily temperatures (°C) in five geographical areas of the Madrid region. The impact of such waves on heat-related mortality due to natural causes (ICD-10: A00- R99), circulatory causes (ICD-10: I00-I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00-J99) was obtained by calculating the relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR), using GLM models with the Poisson link and controlling for trend, seasonalities and the autoregressive nature of the series. Furthermore, we also evaluated other external variables, such as the percentage of the population aged over 65&nbsp;years and the percentage of old housing. No heat-related mortality threshold temperature with statistical significance was detected in the northern and eastern areas. While the threshold temperatures in the central and southern areas were very similar and close to the 90th percentile, the threshold in the western area corresponded to the 97th percentile. Attributable mortality proved to be highest in the central area with 85 heat wave-related deaths per annum. External factors found to influence the impact of heat on mortality in Madrid were the size of the population aged over 65&nbsp;years and the age of residential housing. Demographic structure and the percentage of old housing play a key role in modulating the impact of heat waves. This study concludes that the areas in which heat acts earliest are those having a higher degree of population ageing.},

It has been known that the health impacts of heatwaves have gradually decreased over time due to socio-economic development, climate adaptation, and acclimatization. Contrary to general perception, we found that the recent relative risk of mortality caused by heat days has increased among vulnerable groups. It may associate with recent increasing trends of severe heat days due to climate change. The increasing relative risk was more significant in single-person households and less-educated groups than in the elderly. It implies that the impacts of climate change-induced severe heat days have been and will be concentrated on vulnerable groups. It suggests that social polarization and social isolation should be addressed to reduce heatwave impacts. Furthermore, this study shows the necessity of customized heatwave policies, which consider the characteristics of vulnerable groups.</p>},

   abstract = {Intensive irrigation in India has been demonstrated to decrease surface temperature, but the influence of irrigation on humidity and extreme moist heat stress is not well understood. Here we analysed a combination of in situ and satellite-based datasets and conducted meteorological model simulations to show that irrigation modulates extreme moist heat. We found that intensive irrigation in the region cools the land surface by 1 °C and the air by 0.5 °C. However, the decreased sensible heat flux due to irrigation reduces the planetary boundary layer height, which increases low-level moist enthalpy. Thus, irrigation increases the specific and relative humidity, which raises the moist heat stress metrics. Intense irrigation over the region results in increased moist heat stress in India, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan—affecting about 37–46 million people in South Asia—despite a cooler land surface. We suggest that heat stress projections in India and other regions dominated by semi-arid and monsoon climates that do not include the role of irrigation overestimate the benefits of irrigation on dry heat stress and underestimate the risks.},

   abstract = {Information inequity is a central concern of the digital age. Many recognize the role of public libraries in bridging such inequities. Unfortunately, however, public libraries are often limited by the funding available to them. This study used a geographic information system (GIS), inequality measures, and multiple regressions to analyze statistics from the Public Libraries Survey (PLS) collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and from census tract data. It evaluated the levels of public library funding and services and tested how these resources vary with neighborhood income and urbanization levels. This is one of the few nationwide multivariate studies of neighborhood-level variations. The study revealed significant funding and service variations across the nation's 9000 library systems. Distributions of digital materials, full-time staff with a master's degree in library and information science, and library programs were especially disparate. Library systems in lower-income or rural neighborhoods were relatively less funded and offered fewer information resources. Interestingly, the only variable that was not significantly associated with neighborhood income was the number of public Internet terminals. This suggests that recent funding and research efforts may have made a difference. Similar funding efforts are encouraged for other types of library resources such as staff education and training. In light of the prevalent disparities in resource levels across neighborhoods, the study calls for a fundamental evaluation of the funding mechanisms for libraries. Also, information behavior research should investigate how this structural information inequity affects individuals' information use decisions. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are serious public health burdens in the US. These burdens vary by geographic location with the highest mortality risks reported in the southeastern US. While these disparities have been investigated at state and county levels, little is known regarding disparities in risk at lower levels of geography, such as neighborhoods. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate spatial patterns of stroke and MI mortality risks in the East Tennessee Appalachian Region so as to identify neighborhoods with the highest risks. Methods. Stroke and MI mortality data for the period 1999-2007, obtained free of charge upon request from the Tennessee Department of Health, were aggregated to the census tract (neighborhood) level. Mortality risks were age-standardized by the direct method. To adjust for spatial autocorrelation, population heterogeneity, and variance instability, standardized risks were smoothed using Spatial Empirical Bayesian technique. Spatial clusters of high risks were identified using spatial scan statistics, with a discrete Poisson model adjusted for age and using a 5% scanning window. Significance testing was performed using 999 Monte Carlo permutations. Logistic models were used to investigate neighborhood level socioeconomic and demographic predictors of the identified spatial clusters. Results: There were 3,824 stroke deaths and 5,018 MI deaths. Neighborhoods with significantly high mortality risks were identified. Annual stroke mortality risks ranged from 0 to 182 per 100,000 population (median: 55.6), while annual MI mortality risks ranged from 0 to 243 per 100,000 population (median: 65.5). Stroke and MI mortality risks exceeded the state risks of 67.5 and 85.5 in 28% and 32% of the neighborhoods, respectively. Six and ten significant (p < 0.001) spatial clusters of high risk of stroke and MI mortality were identified, respectively. Neighborhoods belonging to high risk clusters of stroke and MI mortality tended to have high proportions of the population with low education attainment. Conclusions: These methods for identifying disparities in mortality risks across neighborhoods are useful for identifying high risk communities and for guiding population health programs aimed at addressing health disparities and improving population health. © 2011 Pedigo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

They use data on untreated caries from the California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children 2004-2005 and school percentage of participation in free/reduced-price lunch programs to illustrate the methods. Absolute and relative measures, the Slope Index of Inequality, the Relative Index of Inequality (mean and ratio), and the Health Concentration Index were estimated.

Three questions were addressed. Firstly, the utility of a textural classifier based on Gray Level Cooccurance Matrix (GLCM) to interpret IKONOS imagery was examined. It is found that although texture is useful, other types of information, such as spectral reflectance, is necessary to obtain satisfactory accuracy. Secondly, the relationship between the size of an urban area and its population was examined for three spatial units: census tracts, land use polygon, and the intersection of the two. Results show there exists a linear relationship between the natural log of the size and total population when land use polygon is used as the spatial unit. Lastly, the identified relationship was applied to population estimation. Although the overall accuracy is as high as 92%, significant underestimations and overestimations exist especially for areas with the highest or lowest population density. In addition to size, factors such as distance to central business district, accessibility to major roads, slope, and age of a developed area also contribute to population distribution. A case study of Santa Barbara, USA is presented.},

   abstract = {Formally evaluating how specific policy measures influence environmental justice is challenging, especially in the context of regulatory analyses in which quantitative comparisons are the norm. However, there is a large literature on developing and applying quantitative measures of health inequality in other settings, and these measures may be applicable to environmental regulatory analyses. In this paper, we provide information to assist policy decision makers in determining the viability of using measures of health inequality in the context of environmental regulatory analyses. We conclude that quantification of the distribution of inequalities in health outcomes across social groups of concern, considering both within-group and between-group comparisons, would be consistent with both the structure of regulatory analysis and the core definition of environmental justice. Appropriate application of inequality indicators requires thorough characterization of the baseline distribution of exposures and risks, leveraging data generally available within regulatory analyses. Multiple inequality indicators may be applicable to regulatory analyses, and the choice among indicators should be based on explicit value judgments regarding the dimensions of environmental justice of greatest interest. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated air pollution exposure disparities by race/ethnicity and income across criteria air pollutants, locations, or time. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify exposure disparities by race/ethnicity and income throughout the contiguous United States for six criteria air pollutants, during the period 1990 to 2010. METHODS: We quantified exposure disparities among racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic (any race), nonHispanic Asian) and by income for multiple spatial units (contiguous United States, states, urban vs. rural areas) and years (1990, 2000, 2010) for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5; excluding year-1990), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). We used census data for demographic information and a national empirical model for ambient air pollution levels. RESULTS: For all years and pollutants, the racial/ethnic group with the highest national average exposure was a racial/ethnic minority group. In 2010, the disparity between the racial/ethnic group with the highest vs. lowest national-average exposure was largest for NO2 [54% (4.6 ppb)], smallest for O3 [3.6% (1.6 ppb)], and intermediate for the remaining pollutants (13%-19%). The disparities varied by U.S. state; for example, for PM2.5 in 2010, exposures were at least 5% higher than average in 63% of states for non-Hispanic Black populations; in 33% and 26% of states for Hispanic and for non-Hispanic Asian populations, respectively; and in no states for non-Hispanic White populations. Absolute exposure disparities were larger among racial/ethnic groups than among income categories (range among pollutants: Between 1.1 and 21 times larger). Over the period studied, national absolute racial/ethnic exposure disparities declined by between 35% (0.66 μg/m3; PM2.5) and 88% (0.35 ppm; CO); relative disparities declined to between 0.99 × (PM2.5; i.e., nearly zero change) and 0.71 × (CO; i.e., a ∼29% reduction).},

In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico, we find that suicide rates rise 0.7% in US counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities for a 1 °C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in >600 million social media updates further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9–40 thousand additional suicides (95% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.},

   abstract = {Roadway design aims to maximize functionality, safety, and longevity. The materials used for construction, however, are often selected on the assumption of a stationary climate. Anthropogenic climate change may therefore result in rapid infrastructure failure and, consequently, increased maintenance costs, particularly for paved roads where temperature is a key determinant for material selection. Here, we examine the economic costs of projected temperature changes on asphalt roads across the contiguous United States using an ensemble of 19 global climate models forced with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Over the past 20 years, stationary assumptions have resulted in incorrect material selection for 35% of 799 observed locations. With warming temperatures, maintaining the standard practice for material selection is estimated to add approximately US$13.6, US$19.0 and US$21.8 billion to pavement costs by 2010, 2040 and 2070 under RCP4.5, respectively, increasing to US$14.5, US$26.3 and US$35.8 for RCP8.5. These costs will disproportionately affect local municipalities that have fewer resources to mitigate impacts. Failing to update engineering standards of practice in light of climate change therefore significantly threatens pavement infrastructure in the United States.},

   abstract = {Background: Environmental health research employs a variety of metrics to measure heat exposure, both to directly study the health effects of outdoor temperature and to control for temperature in studies of other environmental exposures, including air pollution. To measure heat exposure, environmental health studies often use heat index, which incorporates both air temperature and moisture. However, the method of calculating heat index varies across environmental studies, which could mean that studies using different algorithms to calculate heat index may not be comparable. Objective and Methods: We investigated 21 separate heat index algorithms found in the literature to determine a) whether different algorithms generate heat index values that are consistent with the theoretical concepts of apparent temperature and b) whether different algorithms generate similar heat index values. Results: Although environmental studies differ in how they calculate heat index values, most studies' heat index algorithms generate values consistent with apparent temperature. Additionally, most different algorithms generate closely correlated heat index values. However, a few algorithms are potentially problematic, especially in certain weather conditions (e.g., very low relative humidity, cold weather). To aid environmental health researchers, we have created open-source software in R to calculate the heat index using the U.S. National Weather Service's algorithm. Conclusion: We identified 21 separate heat index algorithms used in environmental research. Our analysis demonstrated that methods to calculate heat index are inconsistent across studies. Careful choice of a heat index algorithm can help ensure reproducible and consistent environmental health research.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise, temperature and humidity will increase further, causing potentially dire increases in human heat stress. On physiological and biophysical grounds, exposure to higher levels of humidity should worsen heat stress by decreasing sweat evaporation. However, population-scale epidemiological studies of heat exposure and response often do not detect associations between high levels of humidity and heat-related mortality or morbidity. These divergent, disciplinary views regarding the role of humidity in heat-related health risks limit confidence in selecting which interventions are effective in reducing health impacts and in projecting future heat-related health risks. OBJECTIVES: Via our multidisciplinary perspective we seek to a) reconcile the competing realities concerning the role of humidity in heat-related health impacts and b) help ensure robust projections of heat-related health risks with climate change. These objectives are critical pathways to identify and communicate effective approaches to cope with present and future heat challenges. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize six key reasons epidemiological studies have found little impact of humidity on heat–health outcomes: a) At high tem-peratures, there may be limited influence of humidity on the health conditions that cause most heat-related deaths (i.e., cardiovascular collapse); b) ep-idemiological data sets have limited spatial extent, a bias toward extratropical (i.e., cooler and less humid), high-income nations, and tend to exist in places where temporal variations in temperature and humidity are positively correlated; c) analyses focus on older, vulnerable populations with sweat-ing, and thus evaporative, impairments that may be further aggravated by dehydration; d) extremely high levels of temperature and humidity (seldom seen in the historical record) are necessary for humidity to substantially impact heat strain of sedentary individuals; e) relationships between temperature and humidity are improperly considered when interpreting epidemiological model results; and f) sub-daily meteorological phenomena, such as rain, occur at high temperatures and humidity, and may bias epidemiological studies based on daily data. Future research must robustly test these hypotheses to advance methods for more accurate incorporation of humidity in estimating heat-related health outcomes under present and projected future climates. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11807.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Extremes of heat and particulate air pollution threaten human health and are becoming more frequent because of climate change. Understanding the health impacts of coexposure to extreme heat and air pollution is urgent. Objectives: To estimate the association of acute coexposure to extreme heat and ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in California from 2014 to 2019. Methods: We used a case-crossover study design with time-stratified matching using conditional logistic regression to estimate mortality associations with acute coexposures to extreme heat and PM2.5. For each case day (date of death) and its control days, daily average PM2.5 and maximum and minimum temperatures were assigned (0- to 3-day lag) on the basis of the decedent’s residence census tract. Measurements and Main Results: All-cause mortality risk increased 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1–8.1) on extreme maximum temperature-only days and 5.0% (95% CI, 3.0–8.0) on extreme PM2.5-only days, compared with nonextreme days. Risk increased by 21.0% (95% CI, 6.6–37.3) on days with exposure to both extreme maximum temperature and PM2.5. Increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality on extreme coexposure days was 29.9% (95% CI, 3.3–63.3) and 38.0% (95% CI, 212.5 to 117.7), respectively, and were more than the sum of individual effects of extreme temperature and PM2.5 only. A similar pattern was observed for coexposure to extreme PM2.5 and minimum temperature. Effect estimates were larger over age 75 years. Conclusions: Short-term exposure to extreme heat and air pollution alone were individually associated with increased risk of mortality, but their coexposure had larger effects beyond the sum of their individual effects.},

   abstract = {Background: Prolonged high temperatures and air pollution from wildfires often occur together, and the two may interact in their effects on mortality. However, there are few data on such possible interactions. Methods: We analyzed day-to-day variations in the number of deaths in Moscow, Russia, in relation to air pollution levels and temperature during the disastrous heat wave and wildfire of 2010. Corresponding data for the period 2006-2009 were used for comparison. Daily average levels of PM10 and ozone were obtained from several continuous measurement stations. The daily number of nonaccidental deaths from specific causes was extracted from official records. Analyses of interactions considered the main effect of temperature as well as the added effect of prolonged high temperatures and the interaction with PM10. Results: The major heat wave lasted for 44 days, with 24-hour average temperatures ranging from 24°C to 31°C and PM10 levels exceeding 300 μg/m on several days. There were close to 11,000 excess deaths from nonaccidental causes during this period, mainly among those older than 65 years. Increased risks also occurred in younger age groups. The most pronounced effects were for deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, and nervous system diseases. Continuously increasing risks following prolonged high temperatures were apparent during the first 2 weeks of the heat wave. Interactions between high temperatures and air pollution from wildfires in excess of an additive effect contributed to more than 2000 deaths. ConclusionS: Interactions between high temperatures and wildfire air pollution should be considered in risk assessments regarding health consequences of climate change.

Between 1983 and 2016, the number of observations in the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Tmax product declined precipitously (5900 / 1000); 1000 poorly distributed measurements are insufficient to resolve regional Tmax variations. Here, we show that combining long (1983 to the near present), high-resolution (0.058), cloud-screened archives of geostationary satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations with a dense set of;15 000 station observations explains 23%, 40%, 30%, 41%, and 1% more variance than the CRU globally and for South America, Africa, India, and areas north of 508N, respectively; even greater levels of improvement are shown for the 2011–16 period (28%, 45%, 39%, 52%, and 28%, respectively). Described here for the first time, the TIR Tmax algorithm uses subdaily TIR distributions to screen out cloud-contaminated observations, providing accurate (correlation'0.8) gridded emission Tmax estimates. Blending these gridded fields with;15 000 station observations provides a seamless, high-resolution source of accurate Tmax estimates that performs well in areas lacking dense in situ observations and even better where in situ observations are available.

However, the evidence for an effect of continuous days of exceptional heat ("heat wave effect") is indirect.

METHODS: Extended time-series data sets of daily mortality counts in 3 major European cities (London, 28 years of data; Budapest, 31 years; Milan, 18 years) were examined in relation to hot weather using a generalized estimating equations approach. We modeled temperature and specific heat wave terms using a variety of specifications. RESULTS: With a linear effect of same-day temperature above an identified threshold, an additional "heat wave" effect of 5.5% was observed in London (95% confidence interval = 2.2 to 8.9), 9.3% in Budapest (5.8 to 13.0), and 15.2% in Milan (5.7 to 22.5). Heat wave effects were reduced slightly when we relaxed the linear assumption and these effects were reduced substantially when temperature was modeled as an average value of lags 0 to 2 days. In London, fewer than half of all heat-related deaths could be attributed to identified heat wave periods. In Milan and Budapest, the fraction was less than one fifth. CONCLUSIONS: Heat wave effects were apparent in simple time-series models but were reduced in multilag nonlinear models and small when compared with the overall summertime mortality burden of heat. Reduction of the overall heat burden requires preventive measures in addition to those that target warnings and responses uniquely to heat waves. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.},

   abstract = {The historical disparities in the socio-demographic structure of New Orleans shaped the social vulnerability of local residents and their responses to Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. These disparities, derived from race, class, gender, and age differences, have resulted in the uneven impact of the catastrophe on various communities in New Orleans, and importantly, their ability to recover. This article examines how the pre-existing social vulnerabilities within New Orleans interacted with the level of flood exposure to produce inequities in the socio-spatial patterns of recovery. Utilizing a combination of statistical and spatial approaches, we found a distinct geographic pattern to the recovery suggesting that the social burdens and impacts from Hurricane Katrina are uneven-the less flooded and less vulnerable areas are recovering faster than tracts with more vulnerable populations and higher levels of flooding. However, there is a more nuanced story, which suggests that it is neighborhoods in the mid-range of social vulnerability where recovery is lagging. While private resources and government programs help groups in the high and low categories of social vulnerability, the middle group shows the slowest rates of recovery. Further, it appears that the congressionally funded State of Louisiana Road Home Program (designed to provide compensation to Louisiana's homeowners who suffered impacts by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for the damage to their home) is not having a significant effect in stimulating recovery within the city. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Using Machine Learning (ML) approach, this research aims to improve the estimation of grid-wise PM2.5, a criteria pollutant, by reducing systematic bias from speciation provided by MERRA-from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). The ML model was trained using various meteorological parameters and aerosol species simulated by MERRA-2 and ground measurements from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality system stations. The ML approach significantly improved performance and reduced mean bias in the 0–10 μg m−3 range. We also used the Random Forest ML model for each EPA region using 1 year of collocated data sets. The resulting ML models for each EPA region were validated, and the aggregate data set has a Spearman Rank correlation (SR) of 0.73 (RMSE = 4.8 μg m−3) and 0.69 (RMSE = 5.8 μg m−3) for training and testing, respectively. The SR (and RMSE in μg m−3) increased to 0.81 (3.9), 0.89 (1.6), and 0.90 (1.1) for daily, monthly, and yearly averages, respectively. The results from the initial implementation of the ML model for the global region are encouraging. Still, they require more research and development to overcome challenges associated with data gaps in many parts of the world.},

We develop geoscience-derived estimates of PM 2.5 composition from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, and statistically fuse these estimates with ground-based observations using a geographically weighted regression over North America to produce a spatially complete representation of sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, black carbon, organic matter, mineral dust, and sea-salt over 2000-2016. Significant long-term agreement is found with cross-validation sites over North America (R 2 = 0.57 - 0.96), with the strongest agreement for sulfate (R 2 = 0.96), nitrate (R 2 = 0.90), and ammonium (R 2 = 0.86). We find that North American decreases in population-weighted fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations since 2000 have been most heavily influenced by regional changes in sulfate and organic matter. Regionally, the relative importance of several chemical components are found to change with PM 2.5 concentration, such as higher PM 2.5 concentrations having a larger proportion of nitrate and a smaller proportion of sulfate. This data set offers information for research into the health effects of PM 2.5 chemical components.},

DESIGN: We examined temporal trends in meat consumption using food availability data from the FAO and US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and further evaluated the meat intake by type (red, white, processed) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) linked to the MyPyramid Equivalents Database (MPED). RESULTS: Overall meat consumption has continued to rise in the USA and the rest of the developed world. Despite a shift towards higher poultry consumption, red meat still represents the largest proportion of meat consumed in the USA (58 %). Twenty-two per cent of the meat consumed in the USA is processed. According to the NHANES 2003-2004, total meat intake averaged 128 g/d. The type and quantities of meat reported varied by education, race, age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Given the plausible epidemiological evidence for red and processed meat intake in cancer and chronic disease risk, understanding the trends and determinants of meat consumption in the USA, where meat is consumed at more than three times the global average, should be particularly pertinent to researchers and other public health professionals aiming to reduce the global burden of chronic disease.},

Using the scenario framework of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), we estimate the future cooling gap, which represents the difference between the population exposed to heat stress and the population able to protect against heat stress with AC. Depending on the scenario of socioeconomic development, total population affected by the cooling gap may vary between 2 billion and 5 billion people in 2050, with the scenario-dependent range widening further towards the end of the century. Our analysis shows vast regional inequalities in adaptive capacity for one of the most universal manifestations of climate change, underscoring the need to account for the different potential levels of adaptive capacity in assessments of climate change impacts.},

   abstract = {Although cities, towns and settlements cover only a tiny fraction (<1%) of the world's surface, urban areas are the nexus of human activity with more than 50% of the population and 70-90% of economic activity. As such, material and energy consumption, air pollution, and expanding impervious surface are all concentrated in urban areas, with important environmental implications at local, regional and potentially global scales. New ways to measure and monitor the built environment over large areas are thus critical to answering a wide range of environmental research questions related to the role of urbanization in climate, biogeochemistry and hydrological cycles. This paper presents a new dataset depicting global urban land at 500-m spatial resolution based on MODIS data (available at http://sage.wisc.edu/urbanenvironment.html). The methodological approach exploits temporal and spectral information in one year of MODIS observations, classified using a global training database and an ensemble decision-tree classification algorithm. To overcome confusion between urban and built-up lands and other land cover types, a stratification based on climate, vegetation, and urban topology was developed that allowed region-specific processing. Using reference data from a sample of 140 cities stratified by region, population size, and level of economic development, results show a mean overall accuracy of 93% (k=0.65) at the pixel level and a high level of agreement at the city scale (R2=0.90). © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

This multi-layer, multisource database will include a suite of 30-meter resolution data that will serve as standardized ingredients for the production of land cover – both nationally and locally. This database will also provide the framework to allow flexibility in developing and applying suites of independent data layers. These nationally standardized independent data layers or components, will be useful not only within the land-cover classification but as data themes for other applications. This database will consist of the following components: (1) normalized tasseled cap (TC) transformations of Landsat 7 imagery for three time periods per scene (early, peak and late), (2) ancillary data layers, including 30m DEM derivatives of slope, aspect and elevation and three STATSCO soil derivatives, (4) image shape and texture information, (5) image derivatives of percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy per-pixel, (6) classified land-cover data derived from the Tassel Capped imagery, ancillary data and derivatives, (7) classification rules and metadata from the land cover classification, allowing future users the potential to modify rules to derive land cover products tailored to their specific local applications. In a pilot study application of the database concept, two mapping zones (Utah and Virginia) were selected for full generation of the above data components. Three derivative layers including, per-pixel imperviousness, per-pixel canopy and land cover were classified from the database. Cross validation accuracies for land cover ranged from 65-82%, and mean absolute error values of 10-15% were reported for percent tree canopy and imperviousness.},

   abstract = {Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300. m and 1000. m, a 30. m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products.Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30. m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65%) at global scale at 30. m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30. m resolution.},

This paper examines whether the initial plan of neighborhoods and their design features have a causal and persistent effect on a neighborhood's physical form. I explore this question in the context of the United States Housing Corporation—the first large-scale urban planning housing initiative in the United States. I show that the plans introduced by the USHC persisted and continue to influence the structure of neighborhoods today. To disentangle the role of location fundamentals (e.g., geography) from the causal effect of plans, I exploit a sharp natural experiment where I compare USHC neighborhoods that were planned but canceled with others that were planned and constructed and show that this persistence is causal and reflects the path dependence of plans. I then decompose plans into their design features and show that the configuration of blocks and the street layout persist via path dependence and are, therefore, characteristics that urban planners can influence in the long-run. Finally, I discuss potential mechanisms and provide suggestive evidence pointing to the role of coordination failures in generating path dependence.},

   abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: In this morphological study I identify and measure recent nationwide trends in American street network design. Historically, orthogonal street grids provided the interconnectivity and density that researchers identify as important factors for reducing vehicular travel and emissions and increasing road safety and physical activity. During the 20th century, griddedness declined in planning practice along with declines in urban form compactness, density, and connectivity as urbanization sprawled around automobile dependence. But less is known about comprehensive empirical trends across U.S. neighborhoods, especially in recent years. Here I use public and open data to examine tract-level street networks across the entire United States. I develop theoretical and measurement frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. I measure how griddedness, orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections, and intersection density declined from 1940 through the 1990s, while dead-ends and block lengths increased. However, since 2000, these trends have rebounded, shifting back toward historical design patterns. Despite this rebound, when controlling for topography and built environment factors, all decades after 1939 are associated with lower griddedness than pre-1940 decades. Higher griddedness is associated with less car ownership—which itself has a well-established relationship with vehicle kilometers traveled and greenhouse gas emissions—while controlling for density, home and household size, income, jobs proximity, street network grain, and local topography. Takeaway for practice: Interconnected grid-like street networks offer practitioners an important tool for curbing car dependence and emissions. Once established, street patterns determine urban spatial structure for centuries, so proactive planning is essential.},

   abstract = {High resolution models are essential to assess the localised impacts of global environmental change. To enable the estimation of the impacts of location-specific change, this paper presents a new modelling approach that disaggregates scenario-based national-level urban population estimates derived from the often-applied Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to high-resolution spatial grid (30 arc sec) representations of urban area and local population. By combining high-resolution spatial data, a sophisticated statistics-based calibration approach and a computationally efficient modelling framework, we can coherently describe local changes in urban area and population across the globe. Both developments are modelled simultaneously using the same scenario assumptions, but divergent patterns are shown to arise when, for example, population decline coincides with decreasing densities that yield an increase in urban area. The model can be applied in integrated global assessment studies focused on trends in local exposure to natural hazards or environmental impacts of urban change. The improved resolution of this new model is crucial to assess the impacts of future population growth in developing regions where most of the planet's biodiversity concentrates near large populations that live in clusters of smaller urban areas previously not captured by coarser resolution models.},

   abstract = {Today, approximately 7.2 billion people inhabit the Earth and by 2050 this number will have risen to around nine billion, of which about 70% will be living in cities. The population growth and the related global urbanization pose one of the major challenges to a sustainable future. Hence, it is essential to understand drivers, dynamics, and impacts of the human settlements development. A key component in this context is the availability of an up-to-date and spatially consistent map of the location and distribution of human settlements. It is here that the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) raster map can make a valuable contribution. The new global GUF binary settlement mask shows a so far unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.4″ (∼12m) that provides – for the first time – a complete picture of the entirety of urban and rural settlements. The GUF has been derived by means of a fully automated processing framework – the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) – that was used to analyze a global coverage of more than 180,000 TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X radar images with 3 m ground resolution collected in 2011–2012. The UFP consists of five main technical modules for data management, feature extraction, unsupervised classification, mosaicking and post-editing. Various quality assessment studies to determine the absolute GUF accuracy based on ground truth data on the one hand and the relative accuracies compared to established settlements maps on the other hand, clearly indicate the added value of the new global GUF layer, in particular with respect to the representation of rural settlement patterns. The Kappa coefficient of agreement compared to absolute ground truth data, for instance, shows GUF accuracies which are frequently twice as high as those of established low resolution maps. Generally, the GUF layer achieves an overall absolute accuracy of about 85%, with observed minima around 65% and maxima around 98%. The GUF will be provided open and free for any scientific use in the full resolution and for any non-profit (but also non-scientific) use in a generalized version of 2.8″ (∼84m). Therewith, the new GUF layer can be expected to break new ground with respect to the analysis of global urbanization and peri-urbanization patterns, population estimation, vulnerability assessment, or the modeling of diseases and phenomena of global change in general.},

In order to understand the current era of urbanization, we must understand long-Term historical urbanization trends and patterns. However, to date there is no comprehensive record of spatially explicit, historic, city-level population data at the global scale. Here, we developed the first spatially explicit dataset of urban settlements from 3700 BC to AD 2000, by digitizing, transcribing, and geocoding historical, archaeological, and census-based urban population data previously published in tabular form by Chandler and Modelski. The dataset creation process also required data cleaning and harmonization procedures to make the data internally consistent. Additionally, we created a reliability ranking for each geocoded location to assess the geographic uncertainty of each data point. The dataset provides the first spatially explicit archive of the location and size of urban populations over the last 6,000 years and can contribute to an improved understanding of contemporary and historical urbanization trends.},

Remotely sensed observations can provide insights into historical urban dynamics, but only during the satellite era. Here, we develop a 1 km resolution global dataset of annual urban dynamics between 1870 and 2100 using an urban cellular automata model trained on satellite observations of urban extent between 1992 and 2013. Hindcast (1870–1990) and projected (2020–2100) urban dynamics under the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were modeled. We find that global urban growth under SSP5, the fossil-fuelled development scenario, was largest with a greater than 40-fold increase in urban extent since 1870. The high resolution dataset captures grid level urban sprawl over 200 years, which can provide insights into the urbanization life cycle of cities and help assess long-term environmental impacts of urbanization and human–environment interactions at a global scale.},

A comprehensive literature review, field measurements and observations, including photographs, and quantitative based approach to assessing vacant land forest structure and values (i-Tree Eco sampling) were utilized, along with aerial photo interpretation, and ground-truthing methods, to identify and catalog vacant parcels of land.; The following types of urban vacant land were identified: post-industrial (3.34 km²), derelict (4.01 km²), unattended with vegetation (17.3 km²), natural (2.78 km²), and transportation-related (5.01 km²). Unattended with vegetation sites can be important resources that support urban ecosystem health; the most effective ecosystem benefits occur in natural sites based on their per-ha value. The redesign of post-industrial sites could build a city's image, while transportation-related sites can contribute a green infrastructure network of open spaces across a city. This typological study could have significant implications for policy development, and for planners and designers seeking to utilize urban vacant land to the best advantage.},

Our study investigated the UHI effect and thermal heat stress of heat index (HI) in the U.S. cities of arid, continental, temperate, and tropical climate zones. A long-term simulation of the UHI and HI was conducted using Community Land Model version 5.0 from 1990 to 2014. The relationship between UHI and HI with climate and energy flux variables are analyzed with divided study periods (1990–2000 and 2001–2014) for the urban impact assessment. Higher sensible heat was reported, particularly in the arid and tropical cities. Further, temperate climate showed increasing annual trends for UHI and ΔHI (urban-rural difference of HIs). The later period (2001–2014) demonstrated greater UHI and ΔHI trends, implying a notable change in climate and urban expansion. The UHI, ranging from 0.73 °C to 2.07 °C, was more intense compared with ΔHI, at 0.14 °C to 1.23 °C. The UHI was positively correlated with temperatures in hot cities, while precipitation is the main driver in the continental city. For ΔHI, the relationship with temperatures were dominant in all climate zones.},

   abstract = {We assessed the influence of control for air pollution and respiratory epidemics on associations between apparent temperature (AT) and daily mortality in Mexico City and Monterrey. Poisson regressions were fit to mortality among all ages, children (ages 0-14 years) and the elderly (ages >or=65 years). Predictors included mean daily AT, season, day of week and public holidays for the base model. Respiratory epidemics and air pollution (particulate matter <10 microm in aerodynamic diameter and O3) were added singly and then jointly for a fully adjusted model. Percent changes in mortality were calculated for days of relatively extreme temperatures [cold (10-11 degrees C) for both cities and heat (35-36 degrees C) for Monterrey], compared to days at the overall mean temperature in each city (15 degrees C in Mexico City, 25 degrees C in Monterrey). In Mexico City, total mortality increased 12.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5%, 14.5%] on cold days (fully adjusted). Among children, the adjusted association was similar [10.9% (95% CI: 5.4%, 16.7%)], but without control for pollution and epidemics, was nearly twice as large [19.7% (95% CI: 13.9%, 25.9)]. In Monterrey, the fully adjusted heat effect for all deaths was 18.7% (95% CI: 11.7%, 26.1%), a third lower than the unadjusted estimate; the heat effect was lower among children [5.5% (95% CI: -10.1%, 23.8%)]. Cold had a similar effect on all-age mortality as in Mexico City [11.7% (95% CI: 3.7%, 20.3%)]. Responses of the elderly differed little from all-ages responses in both cities. Associations between weather and health persisted even with control for air pollution and respiratory epidemics in two Mexican cities, but risk assessments and climate change adaptation programs are best informed by analyses that account for these potential confounders.},

Second, the diffusion of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day–related fatalities. Third, using Dubin and McFadden’s discrete continuous model, the present value of US consumer surplus from the introduction of residential air conditioning is estimated to be $85– $185 billion (2012 dollars).},

High-burden neighborhoods see the largest climate-driven increases in spite of lower enthalpy increases. These neighborhoods also have the most exposure to indoor extreme heat, which may triple by end of century. Energy burden may pose a barrier to AC operation, with estimated cost in the lowest income households reaching up to 6.1% of income for a 100 m2 dwelling, which could increase to 8% by end of century. We also explore adaptation strategies and quantify their impacts, finding that modifying traditional set points and reflective roofs can reduce energy burden significantly, by up to 20% in the highest burden neighborhoods.},

Provided that the effect of weather conditions on suicide operates via a dose-response-like mechanism, time-series (Box-Jenkins) analysis permits an indirect test of the hypothesis that temperature or other weather variables promote higher suicide frequencies in late spring and early summer months. The authors modeled monthly data on suicide and climatic conditions (i.e., temperature, sunshine, and precipitation data) in Switzerland. Cross-correlations between the filtered (prewhitened) residual series were calculated for the period 1881-2000, for consecutive 30-year periods, for different suicide methods, and - with regard to the seasonality hypothesis - for series relying on moving 1- and 3-month frames. Positive cross-correlations emerged between suicide and temperature data for the whole time series, as well as in all consecutive 30-year periods. However, cross-correlations of data series based on moving frames showed a minor peak in associations for summer frames and a major peak in associations for winter frames, the latter reflecting suicides performed mainly outdoors (being run over by a train and jumping from high places). The results represent a novel minor effect in seasonality of suicide, which is hardly compatible with the hypothesized role of temperature in suicide seasonality.

   abstract = {Background: Several studies have identified strong effects of high temperatures on mortality at population level; however, individual vulnerability factors associated with heat-related in-hospital mortality are largely unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate heat-related in-hospital mortality using a multi-city case-crossover analysis. Methods: We studied residents of four Italian cities, aged 65+ years, who died during 1997-2004. For 94 944 individuals who died in hospital and were hospitalised two or more days before death, demographics, chronic conditions, primary diagnoses of last event and hospital wards were considered. A city-specific case-crossover analysis was performed to evaluate the association between apparent temperature and mortality. Pooled odds ratios (OR) of dying on a day with a temperature of 30°C compared to a day with a temperature of 20°C were estimated with a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: We estimated an overall OR of 1.32 (95% confidence interval: 1.25, 1.39). Age, marital status and hospital ward were important risk indicators. Patients in general medicine were at higher risk than those in high and intensive care units. A history of psychiatric disorders and cerebrovascular diseases gave a higher vulnerability. Mortality was greater among patients hospitalised for heart failure, stroke and chronic pulmonary diseases. Conclusions: In-hospital mortality is strongly associated with high temperatures. A comfortable temperature in hospitals and increased attention to vulnerable patients during heatwaves, especially in general medicine, are necessary preventive measures.},

   abstract = {Continued climate change is increasing the frequency, severity, and duration of populations’ high temperature exposures. Indoor cooling is a key adaptation, especially in urban areas, where heat extremes are intensified—the urban heat island effect (UHI)—making residential air conditioning (AC) availability critical to protecting human health. In the United States, the differences in residential AC prevalence from one metropolitan area to another is well understood, but its intra-urban variation is poorly characterized, obscuring neighborhood-scale variability in populations’ heat vulnerability and adaptive capacity. We address this gap by constructing empirically derived probabilities of residential AC for 45,995 census tracts across 115 metropolitan areas. Within cities, AC is unequally distributed, with census tracts in the urban “core” exhibiting systematically lower prevalence than their suburban counterparts. Moreover, this disparity correlates strongly with multiple indicators of social vulnerability and summer daytime surface UHI intensity, highlighting the challenges that vulnerable urban populations face in adapting to climate-change driven heat stress amplification.},

   abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) effect is strongly modulated by urban-scale changes to the aerodynamic, thermal, and radiative properties of the Earth's land surfaces. Interest in this phenomenon, both from the climatological and public health perspectives, has led to hundreds of UHI studies, mostly conducted on a city-by-city basis. These studies, however, do not provide a complete picture of the UHI for administrative units using a consistent methodology. To address this gap, we characterize clear-sky surface UHI (SUHI) intensities for all urbanized areas in the United States using a modified Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) approach by combining a fusion of remotely-sensed data products with multiple US census-defined administrative urban delineations. We find the highest daytime SUHI intensities during summer (1.91 ± 0.97 °C) for 418 of the 497 urbanized areas, while the winter daytime SUHI intensity (0.87 ± 0.45 °C) is the lowest in 439 cases. Since urban vegetation has been frequently cited as an effective way to mitigate UHI, we use NDVI, a satellite-derived proxy for live green vegetation, and US census tract delineations to characterize how vegetation density modulates inter-urban, intra-urban, and inter-seasonal variability in SUHI intensity. In addition, we also explore how elevation and distance from the coast confound SUHI estimates. To further quantify the uncertainties in our estimates, we analyze and discuss some limitations of these satellite-derived products across climate zones, particularly issues with using remotely sensed radiometric temperature and vegetation indices as proxies for urban heat and vegetation cover. We demonstrate an application of this spatially explicit dataset, showing that for the majority of the urbanized areas, SUHI intensity is lower in census tracts with higher median income and higher proportion of white people. Our analysis also suggests that poor and non-white urban residents may suffer the possible adverse effects of summer SUHI without reaping the potential benefits (e.g., warmer temperatures) during winter, though establishing this result requires future research using more comprehensive heat stress metrics. This study develops new methodological advancements to characterize SUHI and its intra-urban variability at levels of aggregation consistent with sources of other socioeconomic information, which can be relevant in future inter-disciplinary research and as a possible screening tool for policy-making.

   abstract = {The commonly used weather stations cannot fully capture the spatiotemporal variability of near-surface air temperature (Tair), leading to exposure misclassification and biased health effect estimates. We aimed to improve the spatiotemporal coverage of Tair data in Germany by using multi-stage modeling to estimate daily 1 × 1 km minimum (Tmin), mean (Tmean), maximum (Tmax) Tair and diurnal Tair range during 2000–2020. We used weather station Tair observations, satellite-based land surface temperature (LST), elevation, vegetation and various land use predictors. In the first stage, we built a linear mixed model with daily random intercepts and slopes for LST adjusted for several spatial predictors to estimate Tair from cells with both Tair and LST available. In the second stage, we used this model to predict Tair for cells with only LST available. In the third stage, we regressed the second stage predictions against interpolated Tair values to obtain Tair countrywide. All models achieved high accuracy (0.91 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.98) and low errors (1.03 °C ≤ Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ≤ 2.02 °C). Validation with external data confirmed the good performance, locally, i.e., in Augsburg for all models (0.74 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99, 0.87 °C ≤ RMSE ≤ 2.05 °C) and countrywide, for the Tmean model (0.71 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99, 0.79 °C ≤ RMSE ≤ 1.19 °C). Annual Tmean averages ranged from 8.56 °C to 10.42 °C with the years beyond 2016 being constantly hotter than the 21-year average. The spatial variability within Germany exceeded 15 °C annually on average following patterns including mountains, rivers and urbanization. Using a case study, we showed that modeling leads to broader Tair variability representation for exposure assessment of participants in health cohorts. Our results indicate the proposed models as suitable for estimating nationwide Tair at high resolution. Our product is critical for temperature-based epidemiological studies and is also available for other research purposes.},

   abstract = {<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Heat stress profoundly and unanimously reduces orthostatic tolerance. This review aims to provide an overview of the numerous and multifactorial mechanisms by which this occurs in humans. Potential causal factors include changes in arterial and venous vascular resistance and blood distribution, and the modulation of cardiac output, all of which contribute to the inability to maintain cerebral perfusion during heat and orthostatic stress. A number of countermeasures have been established to improve orthostatic tolerance during heat stress, which alleviate heat stress induced central hypovolemia (e.g., volume expansion) and/or increase peripheral vascular resistance (e.g., skin cooling). Unfortunately, these countermeasures can often be cumbersome to use with populations prone to syncopal episodes. Identifying the mechanisms of inter-individual differences in orthostatic intolerance during heat stress has proven elusive, but could provide greater insights into the development of novel and personalized countermeasures for maintaining or improving orthostatic tolerance during heat stress. This development will be especially impactful in occuational settings and clinical situations that present with orthostatic intolerance and/or central hypovolemia. Such investigations should be considered of vital importance given the impending increased incidence of heat events, and associated cardiovascular challenges that are predicted to occur with the ensuing changes in climate.</p>},

   abstract = {Although injury is a leading cause of death worldwide, the association between ambient temperature and injury has received little research attention compared to the association of temperature with mortality and morbidity from non-external causes. With current climate change and increases in weather extremes, assessing the association between temperature and injury is important for determining public health priorities. Therefore, the present study examined the association between ambient temperature and injury risk with a focus on the intentions and mechanisms of injury. Using the national emergency database, we identified a total of 703,503 injured patients who had visited emergency departments in Seoul, South Korea from 2008 to 2016. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study using a conditional Poisson regression model, and applied a distributed lag nonlinear model to explore possible nonlinear and delayed effects of daily mean temperature on injury risk. Injury risk was significantly associated with ambient temperature, and temperature-injury association curves markedly differed with respect to intentions and mechanisms of injury. Although unintentional injuries increased significantly at both high and low temperatures, intentional injuries – including self-harm and assault – significantly increased only at high temperatures. The mechanism-specific analyses showed that injuries caused by traffic accidents and burns significantly increased at both high and low temperatures. However, injuries caused by all other mechanisms (i.e., fall, blunt object, machinery, penetration, and poisoning) significantly increased only at high temperatures, while injury due to slipping increased at low temperatures. Our study provides evidence that ambient temperature is associated with risk of injury, and this association differs depending on the intentions and mechanisms of injury. Overall, our findings help foster a more comprehensive understanding of the association between temperature and injury that can be used to establish appropriate public health policies and targeted interventions.},

   abstract = {This study explores the combined application of remote sensing, spatial metrics and spatial modeling to the analysis and modeling of urban growth in Santa Barbara, California. The investigation is based on a 72-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical aerial photography and from IKONOS satellite imagery. Spatial metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four administrative districts, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth. The metrics quantify the temporal and spatial properties of urban development, and show definitively the impacts of growth constraints imposed on expansion by topography and by local planning efforts. The SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model was calibrated using the multi-temporal data sets for the entire study region. The calibrated model allowed us to fill gaps in the discontinuous historical time series of urban spatial extent, since maps and images were available only for selected years between 1930 and 2001. The model also allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth to the year 2030. The spatial metrics provided a detailed description of the accuracy of the model's historical simulations that applied also to forecasts of future development. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial pattern of urban growth. Even using modeling, however, the forecasting of urban development remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and their incorporation into the model calibration process. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling is powerful, and may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the spatiotemporal forms due to the process of urbanization. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Yet spatial projections of how much and where it may occur are often limited to short-term futures and small geographic areas. Here we produce a first empirically-grounded set of global, spatial urban land projections over the 21st century. We use a data-science approach exploiting 15 diverse datasets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations. We find the global total amount of urban land could increase by a factor of 1.8–5.9, and the per capita amount by a factor of 1.1–4.9, across different socioeconomic scenarios over the century. Though the fastest urban land expansion occurs in Africa and Asia, the developed world experiences a similarly large amount of new development.

   abstract = {This paper analyzes land use change, urbanization and their impact on the change in landscape pattern in Tabriz metropolitan area (TMA) during the time period from 1996 to 2016 in order to provide support sustainable regional planning. For this purpose, land use data obtained from satellite images including Landsat Thematic Map-per (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for 1996, 2006, and 2016 with 30 × 30 m spatial resolution. This paper first seeks to analyze the changes in land use and urbanization, followed by changes in landscape patterns by using spatial metrics and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI). Then, using two methods of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), magnitude and direction of the relationship between land use changes, urbanization, and change in landscape patterns are analyzed. The findings show that most ecological lands such as grasslands have been converted into bare and urban lands over the past two decades. Therefore, in the whole landscape, the expansion of urbanization has led to the prevailing pattern, resulting in increased fragmentation and reduced aggregation. The results also show that changes in landscape patterns have a strong relationship with changes in various land uses. In addition, GWR analysis was used to analyze the impact of urbanization on changes in landscape patterns, indicating that urbanization expansion has different effects with changes in spatial positions, so that in areas adjacent to the built-up lands and the central regions of TMA, with increasing urbanization, we see increasing aggregation in the landscape, but as we move away from the built-up areas, are faced with an increase in fragmentation and het-erogeneity, especially in the northeastern, south and southwest areas of TMR.},

Moreover, they are especially vulnerable to these changes owing to the concentration of population and their exposure to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards, emphasizing the need for spatially detailed information on urbanized landscapes. These data need to be consistent in content and scale and provide a holistic description of urban layouts to address different user needs. Here, we map the continental United States into Local Climate Zone (LCZ) types at a 100 m spatial resolution using expert and crowd-sourced information. There are 10 urban LCZ types, each associated with a set of relevant variables such that the map represents a valuable database of urban properties. These data are benchmarked against continental-wide existing and novel geographic databases on urban form. We anticipate the dataset provided here will be useful for researchers and practitioners to assess how the configuration, size, and shape of cities impact the important human and environmental outcomes.},

Typically, these issues are studied on a city-by-city basis owing to the spatial complexity of built landscapes, local topography and emission patterns. However, to ensure knowledge sharing and to integrate local-scale processes with regional and global scale modelling initiatives, there is a pressing need for a world-wide database on cities that is suited for environmental studies. In this paper we present a European database that has a particular focus on characterising urbanised landscapes. It has been derived using tools and techniques developed as part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, which has the goal of acquiring and disseminating climate-relevant information on cities worldwide. The European map is the first major step toward creating a global database on cities that can be integrated with existing topographic and natural land-cover databases to support modelling initiatives.},

   abstract = {The availability of high spatio-temporal resolution of urban air temperature is paramount for understanding urban heat island (UHI) and developing effective mitigation strategies, in particular for local-scale mitigations. Obtaining high spatial resolution of air temperature at city-scale is challenging as the quantity of weather stations is often limited in cities, particularly in those less developed ones. In this study, based on the existing weather station network in Guangzhou city, China, we compare eight different air temperature predictive models and select one with the best performance to interpolate city-scale air temperature. The training and validation of the models are performed using observatory meteorological data of 321 weather stations in Guangzhou. Deep learning-derived land cover information and social-economic data are encoded to be used as explanatory variables. The regression kriging combined with multiple linear regression is found to result in the best performance, with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.92 °C and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.959. Furthermore, the quantities and locations of current weather stations can be optimized by the proposed model. Guided by the k-means clustering alongside the information of geocoordinates and land cover, the number of current weather stations in Guangzhou can be reduced by 50% (i.e., 160 weather stations) while retaining the model performance. This study proposes and demonstrates an effective model for obtaining city-scale air temperature at high spatio-temporal resolution with data from sparse weather stations, which is much needed for cities which want to enhance their city-scale air temperature mapping by complementing new weather stations to their existing weather station network.},

   abstract = {There is a scientific consensus on the need for spatially detailed information on urban landscapes at a global scale. These data can support a range of environmental services, since cities are places of intense resource consumption and waste generation and of concentrated infrastructure and human settlement exposed to multiple hazards of natural and anthropogenic origin. In the face of climate change, urban data are also required to explore future urbanization pathways and urban design strategies in order to lock in long-term resilience and sustainability, protecting cities from future decisions that could undermine their adaptability and mitigation role. To serve this purpose, we present a 100ĝ€¯m-resolution global map of local climate zones (LCZs), a universal urban typology that can distinguish urban areas on a holistic basis, accounting for the typical combination of micro-scale land covers and associated physical properties. The global LCZ map, composed of 10 built and 7 natural land cover types, is generated by feeding an unprecedented number of labelled training areas and earth observation images into lightweight random forest models. Its quality is assessed using a bootstrap cross-validation alongside a thematic benchmark for 150 selected functional urban areas using independent global and open-source data on surface cover, surface imperviousness, building height, and anthropogenic heat. As each LCZ type is associated with generic numerical descriptions of key urban canopy parameters that regulate atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability of this globally consistent and climate-relevant urban description is an important prerequisite for supporting model development and creating evidence-based climate-sensitive urban planning policies.

The dataset consists of five daily variables: maximum, minimum and mean temperature, mean sea-level pressure, and total precipitation. In addition to daily summaries, we produced monthly and annual summaries, and daily, monthly, and annual long-term means. Daily gridded data were interpolated using the Random Forest Spatial Interpolation methodology, based on using the nearest observations and distances to them as spatial covariates, together with environmental covariates to make a random forest model. The accuracy of the MeteoSerbia1km daily dataset was assessed using nested 5-fold leave-location-out cross-validation. All temperature variables and sea-level pressure showed high accuracy, although accuracy was lower for total precipitation, due to the discontinuity in its spatial distribution. MeteoSerbia1km was also compared with the E-OBS dataset with a coarser resolution: both datasets showed similar coarse-scale patterns for all daily meteorological variables, except for total precipitation. As a result of its high resolution, MeteoSerbia1km is suitable for further environmental analyses.

   abstract = {Modeling urban microclimate accurately is challenging due to the high surface heterogeneity of urban land cover and the vertical structure of street morphology. Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in numerical modeling and data collection of the urban environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the physical-based models to fully utilize the high-resolution data under the constraints of computing resources. The advancement in machine learning techniques offers the computational strength to handle the massive volume of data. In this study, we proposed a machine learning approach to estimate point-scale street-level air temperature from the urban-resolving mesoscale climate model and a suite of hyper-resolution urban informatics, including three-dimensional urban morphology, parcel-level land use inventory, and a dense weather observation network. We implemented this approach in the City of Chicago as a case study. The proposed approach vastly improves the resolution of temperature predictions in cities, which will help the city with walkability, drivability, and heat-related behavioral studies. Moreover, we tested the model's reliability on out-of-sample locations to investigate the application potentials to the other areas. This study also aims to gain insights into next-gen urban climate modeling and guide city observation efforts to build the strength for the holistic understanding of urban microclimate dynamics.

   abstract = {A growing literature documents the effects of heat stress on premature mortality and other adverse health outcomes. Urban heat islands (UHI) can exacerbate these adverse impacts in cities by amplifying heat exposure during the day and inhibiting the body's ability to recover at night. Since the UHI intensity varies not only across, but also within cities, intra-city variation may lead to differential impact of urban heat stress on different demographic groups. To examine these differential impacts, we combine satellite observations with census data to evaluate the relationship between distributions of both UHI and income at the neighborhood scale for 25 cities around the world. We find that in most (72%) cases, poorer neighborhoods experience elevated heat exposure, an incidental consequence of the intra-city distribution of income in cities. This finding suggests that policymakers should consider designing city-specific UHI reduction strategies to mitigate its impacts on the most socioeconomically vulnerable populations who may be less equipped to adapt to environmental stressors. Since the strongest contributor of intra-urban UHI variability among the physical characteristics considered in this study is a neighborhood's vegetation density, increasing green space in lower income neighborhoods is one strategy urban policymakers can adopt to ameliorate some of UHI's inequitable burden on economically disadvantaged residents.},

Editor: P. Kassomenos Proximate pollutant data can provide information for land-use predictors in LUR models, when coupled with spatial interpolation of ambient pollutant measurements, may provide better pollutant predictions. This study applies a hybrid kriging/LUR model to assess the spatial-temporal variability of PM 2.5 for Taiwan. Using PM 2.5 concentrations at 71 EPA monitoring stations from 2006 to 2011, pollutant gradient surfaces were spatially interpolated using a leave-one-out ordinary kriging method based on "n-1" observations. The predicted concentration level of the targeted site was then extracted from the generated kriging map and adopted as a variable in LUR modelling. Annual and monthly resolutions of LUR models were developed to assess the effects by incorporating kriging-based estimates into pollutant predictions. The R 2 obtained from conventional LUR procedures was 0.66 and 0.70 for annual and monthly models, respectively, whereas models using the hybrid approach showed better explanatory power (R 2 of annual model: 0.85; R 2 of monthly model: 0.88). Moreover, kriging-based PM 2.5 estimates were the most important factor in the resultant models according to the dominant partial R 2 of 0.82 and 0.7 in monthly and yearly models. Cross-validation and external data verification showed similar results, demonstrating robustness of the proposed approach. Using governmental pollutant observations is usually publicly available for most areas, this method provides an efficient mean to better assess PM 2.5 spatial-temporal variations and predicts levels for nonmonitored areas.},

   abstract = {For many decades, kriging and deterministic interpolation techniques, such as inverse distance weighting and nearest neighbour interpolation, have been the most popular spatial interpolation techniques. Kriging with external drift and regression kriging have become basic techniques that benefit both from spatial autocorrelation and covariate information. More recently, machine learning techniques, such as random forest and gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular and are now often used for spatial interpolation. Some attempts have been made to explicitly take the spatial component into account in machine learning, but so far, none of these approaches have taken the natural route of incorporating the nearest observations and their distances to the prediction location as covariates. In this research, we explored the value of including observations at the nearest locations and their distances from the prediction location by introducing Random Forest Spatial Interpolation (RFSI). We compared RFSI with deterministic interpolation methods, ordinary kriging, regression kriging, Random Forest and Random Forest for spatial prediction (RFsp) in three case studies. The first case study made use of synthetic data, i.e., simulations from normally distributed stationary random fields with a known semivariogram, for which ordinary kriging is known to be optimal. The second and third case studies evaluated the performance of the various interpolation methods using daily precipitation data for the 2016–2018 period in Catalonia, Spain, and mean daily temperature for the year 2008 in Croatia. Results of the synthetic case study showed that RFSI outperformed most simple deterministic interpolation techniques and had similar performance as inverse distance weighting and RFsp. As expected, kriging was the most accurate technique in the synthetic case study. In the precipitation and temperature case studies, RFSI mostly outperformed regression kriging, inverse distance weighting, random forest, and RFsp. Moreover, RFSI was substantially faster than RFsp, particularly when the training dataset was large and high-resolution prediction maps were made.},

One heat stress metric is the wet-bulb globe temperature, which takes into consideration the effects of radiation, humidity, and wind speed. It also has broad health and environmental implications. This study presents wet-bulb globe temperatures calculated from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis and combines it with health guidelines to assess heat stress variability and the potential for reduction in labor hours over the past decade on both the continental and urban scale. Compared to 2010–2014, there was a general increase in heat stress during the period from 2015 to 2019 throughout the northern hemisphere, with the largest warming found in tropical regions, especially in the northern part of the Indian Peninsula. On the urban scale, our results suggest that heat stress might have led to a reduction in labor hours by up to ~20% in some Asian cities subject to work–rest regulations. Extremes in heat stress can be explained by changes in radiation and circulation. The resultant threat is highest in developing countries in tropical areas where workers often have limited legal protection and healthcare. The effect of heat stress exposure is therefore a collective challenge with environmental, economic, and social implications.},

   abstract = {Background: Air conditioning (AC) presents a viable means of tackling the ill-effects of heat on human health. However, AC releases additional anthropogenic heat outdoors, and this could be detrimental to human health, especially in urban communities. This study determined the excess heat-related mortality attributable to anthropogenic heat from AC use under various projected global warming scenarios in seven Japanese cities. The overall protection from AC use was also measured. Methods: Daily average 2-meter temperatures in the hottest month of August from 2000 to 2010 were modeled using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with BEP+BEM (building effect parameterization and building energy model). Risk functions for heat–mortality associations were generated with and without AC use from a two-stage time series analysis. We coupled simulated August temperatures and heat–mortality risk functions to estimate averted deaths and unavoidable deaths from AC use. Results: Anthropogenic heat from AC use slightly augmented the daily urban temperatures by 0.046 °C in Augusts of 2000–2010 and up to 0.181 °C in a future with 3 °C urban warming. This temperature rise was attributable to 3.1–3.5 % of heat-related deaths in Augusts of 2000–2010 under various urban warming scenarios. About 36–47 % of heat-related deaths could be averted by air conditioning use under various urban warming scenarios. Discussion: AC has a valuable protective effect from heat despite some unavoidable mortality from anthropogenic heat release. Overall, the use of AC as a major adaptive strategy requires careful consideration.},

   abstract = {Adverse health outcomes caused by extreme heat represent the most direct human health threat associated with the warming of the Earth's climate. Socioeconomic, demographic, health, land cover, and temperature determinants contribute to heat vulnerability; however, nationwide patterns of residential and race/ethnicity disparities in heat vulnerability in the United States are poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for the United States; to assess differences in heat vulnerability across geographies that have experienced historical and/or contemporary forms of marginalization; and to quantify HVI by race/ethnicity. Principal component analysis was used to calculate census tract level HVI scores based on the 2019 population characteristics of the United States. Differences in HVI scores were analyzed across the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” grades, the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged communities, and race/ethnicity groups. HVI scores were calculated for 55,267 U.S. census tracts. Mean HVI scores were 17.56, 18.61, 19.45, and 19.93 for HOLC grades “A”–“D,” respectively. CEJST-defined disadvantaged census tracts had a significantly higher mean HVI score (19.13) than non-disadvantaged tracts (16.68). The non-Hispanic African American or Black race/ethnicity group had the highest HVI score (18.51), followed by Hispanic or Latino (18.19). Historically redlined and contemporary CEJST disadvantaged census tracts and communities of color were found to be associated with increased vulnerability to heat. These findings can help promote equitable climate change adaptation policies by informing policymakers about the national distribution of place- and race/ethnicity-based disparities in heat vulnerability.},

   abstract = {Extreme heat is increasingly being acknowledged as a serious hazard to human health, through a combination of physiological responses to heat, expressed as dry and wet bulb temperatures, and personal factors. Here we present an analysis of the diurnal variability of dry and wet bulb temperatures using station data in South Asia during both regular and heatwave days. We find that diurnal cycles differ, with the daily maximum wet bulb temperature occurring several hours after the daily maximum dry bulb temperature. Using radiosonde profiles, we show that the timing and amplitude of the diurnal variability of wet bulb temperature can be explained by changes in boundary layer depths and water content. Physiological thresholds for uncompensable heat stress were exceeded even in the evenings, many hours after dry bulb temperature peaks. Cumulative exceedances occurred in 105 instances, corresponding to at least 300 hours of exposure to uncompensable heat stress in South Asia between 1995 and 2020. We conclude that physiologically relevant thresholds provide a more robust way to estimate health impacts, and that wet bulb temperature alone is insufficient as an indicator of hazardous heat. Human physiological thresholds for uncompensable heat stress were exceeded for more than 300 hours in South Asia between 1995 and 2020, including in the evenings, according to an analysis of the diurnal variability of wet and dry bulb temperatures in station data.},

   abstract = {The diurnal and seasonal patterns of the dry and wet bulb temperatures over Argentina are studied. The wet bulb temperature frequency distributions have negative skewness over all the country. The higher values are in the lower latitude stations, which are under a subtropical regime. The dry bulb temperature frequency distributions change their skewness from north (negative values) to south, and the highest positive value occurs at the most southerly station, which is under a middle latitude regime. Three stations in the Buenos Aires area are analysed to study the effects of the river and the city on temperature. The effects of the city and the river on the dry bulb temperature and the wet bulb temperature depend on the wind direction and the time of day. The effect of the river also depends on the month. These effects are also present in the anomalies. If it is necessary to represent extreme climatic or synoptic conditions over a region then the city stations are more appropriate than coastal ones.

   abstract = { Although the lethal consequences of extreme heat are increasingly reported in the literature, the fitness costs of exposure to sublethal high air temperatures, typically identified in the 30–40°C range, are poorly understood. We examine the effect of high (≥35°C) daily maxima on body condition of a semiarid population of White‐plumed Honeyeaters, Ptilotula penicillatus , monitored between 1986 and 2012. During this 26‐yr period, temperature has risen, on average, by 0.06°C each year at the site, the frequency of days with thermal maxima ≥35°C has increased and rainfall has declined. Exposure to high temperatures affected body condition of White‐plumed Honeyeaters, but only in low‐rainfall conditions. There was no effect of a single day of exposure to temperatures ≥35°C but repeated exposure was associated with reduced body condition: 3.0% reduction in body mass per day of exposure. Rainfall in the previous 30 d ameliorated these effects, with reduced condition evident only in dry conditions. Heat‐exposed males with reduced body condition were less likely to be recaptured at the start of the following spring; they presumably died. Heat‐exposed females, regardless of body condition, showed lower survival than exposed males, possibly due to their smaller body mass. The higher mortality of females and smaller males exposed to temperatures ≥35°C may have contributed to the increase in mean body size of this population over 23 years. Annual survival declined across time concomitant with increasing frequency of days ≥35°C and decreasing rainfall. Our study is one of few to identify a proximate cause of climate change related mortality, and associated long‐term demographic consequence. Our results have broad implications for avian communities living in arid and semiarid regions of Australia, and other mid‐latitudes regions where daily maximum temperatures already approach physiological limits in regions affected by both decreased precipitation and warming. },

In the present study, we implemented&nbsp;a case-crossover design, which controls for seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and non- or slowly-varying confounders, with distributed lag non-linear temperature terms (0–6 days) to estimate associations between daily ZIP Code-level temperature and alcohol- and substance-related disorder hospital visit rates in New York State during 1995–2014. We also examined&nbsp;four substance-related disorder sub-causes (cannabis, cocaine, opioid, sedatives). Here we show that, for alcohol-related disorders, a daily increase in temperature from the daily minimum (−30.1 °C (−22.2 °F)) to the 75th percentile (18.8 °C (65.8 °F)) across 0–6 lag days is associated with a cumulative 24.6% (95%CI,14.6%–34.6%) increase in hospital visit rates, largely driven by increases on the day of and day before hospital visit, with an association larger outside New York City. For substance-related disorders, we find evidence of a positive association at temperatures from the daily minimum (−30.1 °C (−22.2 °F)) to the 50th percentile (10.4 °C (50.7 °F)) (37.7% (95%CI,27.2%–48.2%), but not at higher temperatures. Findings are consistent across age group, sex, and social vulnerability. Our work highlights how hospital visits from alcohol- and substance-related disorders are currently impacted by elevated temperatures and could be further affected by rising temperatures resulting from climate change. Enhanced social infrastructure and health system interventions could mitigate these impacts. We investigated the relationship between temperature and hospital visits related to alcohol and other drugs including cannabis, cocaine, opioids, and sedatives in New York State. We found that higher temperatures resulted in more hospital visits for alcohol. For other drugs, higher temperatures also resulted in more hospital visits but only up to a certain temperature level. Our findings suggest that rising temperatures, including those caused by climate change, may influence hospital visits for alcohol and other drugs, emphasizing the need for appropriate and proportionate social and health interventions, as well as highlighting potential hidden burdens of climate change. Parks et al. find that higher temperatures are associated with increased hospital visits for alcohol- and substance-related disorders in New York State. This suggests that rising temperatures due to climate change may impact the burden of mental health-related conditions.},

There is a critical need to identify the factors driving COVID-19 risk in nursing homes to better understand and address the conditions contributing to their vulnerability during public health crises. This study investigates the characteristics associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths among residents in U.S. nursing homes from 2020 to 2021, with a focus on geospatial and racial inequalities. Using data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and LTCFocus, this paper uses zero-inflated negative binomial regression models, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and Local Moran's I to generate statistical and geospatial results. Our analysis reveals that majority Hispanic facilities have alarmingly high COVID-19 cases and deaths, suggesting that these facilities have the greatest need for policy improvements in staffing and financing to reduce racial inequalities in nursing home care. At the same time we also detect COVID-19 hot spots in rural areas with predominately White residents, indicating a need to rethink public messaging strategies in these areas. The top states with COVID-19 hot spots are Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Oklahoma. This research provides new insights into the socio-spatial contexts and inequities that contribute to the vulnerability of nursing home residents during a pandemic.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the collection and utilisation of crowdsourced data has gained attention in atmospheric sciences and citizen weather stations (CWS), i.e., privately-owned weather stations whose owners share their data publicly via the internet, have become increasingly popular. This is particularly the case for cities, where traditional measurement networks are sparse. Rigorous quality control (QC) of CWS data is essential prior to any application. In this study, we present the QC package “CrowdQC+,” which identifies and removes faulty air-temperature (ta) data from crowdsourced CWS data sets, i.e., data from several tens to thousands of CWS. The package is a further development of the existing package “CrowdQC.” While QC levels and functionalities of the predecessor are kept, CrowdQC+ extends it to increase QC performance, enhance applicability, and increase user-friendliness. Firstly, two new QC levels are introduced. The first implements a spatial QC that mainly addresses radiation errors, the second a temporal correction of the data regarding sensor-response time. Secondly, new functionalities aim at making the package more flexible to apply to data sets of different lengths and sizes, enabling also near-real time application. Thirdly, additional helper functions increase user-friendliness of the package. As its predecessor, CrowdQC+ does not require reference meteorological data. The performance of the new package is tested with two 1-year data sets of CWS data from hundreds of “Netatmo” CWS in the cities of Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Toulouse, France. Quality-controlled data are compared with data from networks of professionally-operated weather stations (PRWS). Results show that the new package effectively removes faulty data from both data sets, leading to lower deviations between CWS and PRWS compared to its predecessor. It is further shown that CrowdQC+ leads to robust results for CWS networks of different sizes/densities. Further development of the package could include testing the suitability of CrowdQC+ for other variables than ta, such as air pressure or specific humidity, testing it on data sets from other background climates such as tropical or desert cities, and to incorporate added filter functionalities for further improvement. Overall, CrowdQC+ could lead the way to utilise CWS data in world-wide urban climate applications.},

In particular, CWS can provide long-term measurements of urban heat and valuable information on spatio-temporal heterogeneity related to horizontal heat advection. In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic dataset covering six years (2015-2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater London. We investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate Zones (LCZ) - a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England region. We find that London is on average warmer by about 1.0 ° C-1.5 ° C than the rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA) contributes to 0.22 ± 0.96 ° C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute to urban heat by up to 1.57 ° C, on average and negatively by down to -1.21 ° C. Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show the added value of CWS when considering future urban design.},

PurpleAir sensors comprise a massive global network of more than 10ĝ€¯000 sensors. Previous performance evaluations have typically studied a limited number of PurpleAir sensors in small geographic areas or laboratory environments. While useful for determining sensor behavior and data normalization for these geographic areas, little work has been done to understand the broad applicability of these results outside these regions and conditions. Here, PurpleAir sensors operated by air quality monitoring agencies are evaluated in comparison to collocated ambient air quality regulatory instruments. In total, almost 12ĝ€¯000 24ĝ€¯h averaged PM2.5 measurements from collocated PurpleAir sensors and Federal Reference Method (FRM) or Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) PM2.5 measurements were collected across diverse regions of the United States (US), including 16 states. Consistent with previous evaluations, under typical ambient and smoke-impacted conditions, the raw data from PurpleAir sensors overestimate PM2.5 concentrations by about 40ĝ€¯% in most parts of the US. A simple linear regression reduces much of this bias across most US regions, but adding a relative humidity term further reduces the bias and improves consistency in the biases between different regions. More complex multiplicative models did not substantially improve results when tested on an independent dataset. The final PurpleAir correction reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the raw data from 8 to 3ĝ€¯μgĝ€¯m-3, with an average FRM or FEM concentration of 9ĝ€¯μgĝ€¯m-3. This correction equation, along with proposed data cleaning criteria, has been applied to PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements across the US on the AirNow Fire and Smoke Map (https://fire.airnow.gov/, last access: 14 May 2021) and has the potential to be successfully used in other air quality and public health applications.},

In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China, we further applied this developed method and proved it to be reliable and consistent with the China Environmental Status Bulletin. Results indicate that the vulnerability of atmospheric environment in the BTH region is not optimistic, and environment managers should do more about air pollution. Thus, the most appropriate strategic decision and development program of city or state can be picked out assisting by the vulnerable results.},

Estimated PM2.5 concentrations in each study area were compared to census tract-level environmental justice vulnerability indicators, including environmental, health, and demographic data. Higher PM2.5 concentrations were positively correlated with poverty, cardiovascular emergency department visits, and housing inequities. Sensors within 30 km of actively burning wildfires showed statistically significant increases in indoor (~800 %) and outdoor (~540 %) PM2.5 during the fires. Results indicate that wildfire emissions may exacerbate existing health disparities as well as the burden of pollution in disadvantaged communities, suggesting a need to improve monitoring and adaptive capacity among vulnerable populations.},

Urban form was quantified using Smart Growth America (SGA) sprawl indexes with density, land use mixing, centeredness, and street connectivity. NOx emissions from road traffic were derived from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Through modeling NO2 concentrations using land use regression (LUR), with satellite-based estimates and kriging, this study measured NO2 concentrations within MAs in the US The study results showed that higher levels of urban form scores (i.e., higher compactness) and land use mixing were associated with lower per-person NOx emissions from road traffic. In addition, higher levels of centeredness were associated with lower NO2 concentrations, but the effect was moderate. On the other hand, regional rainfall and solar insolation had more significant associations with NO2 concentrations than metropolitan urban form. Meanwhile, localized emissions sources had significant associations with local-level NO2 concentrations. This study provides additional evidence on the relationship between urban form and air quality in the US MAs. The study suggests that high compactness-oriented development and the reduction of localized emission sources may be effective in reducing NOx emissions from road traffic and local NO2 concentrations, respectively. However, future studies need to explore the impact of urban form at both the MA and local levels on NO2 concentrations and develop a more accurate national NO2 concentration prediction model.},

We included spatially and temporally varying predictors in a random forest model with random oversampling of high concentrations to predict PM2.5. The model achieved high prediction accuracy (10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 = 0.93, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 3.23 μg/m3; spatial CV R2 = 0.88, spatial RMSE = 4.33 μg/m3; temporal CV R2 = 0.90, temporal RMSE = 3.85 μg/m3). Our model was able to predict spatial and diurnal patterns in PM2.5 on typical weekdays and weekends, as well as non-typical days, such as holidays and wildfire days. The model allows for far more precise estimates of PM2.5 than existing methods based on few sensors. Taking advantage of low-cost PM2.5 sensors, our hourly random forest model predictions can be combined with time-activity diaries in future studies, enabling geographically and temporally fine exposure estimation for specific population groups in studies of acute air pollution health effects and studies of environmental justice issues.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of a novel, real-time sensor network for routine monitoring of racial and economic disparities in fine particulate matter (PM2.5; particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) exposures at the neighborhood level. Methods. We deployed a dense network of low-cost PM2.5 sensors in Chicago, Illinois, to evaluate associations between neighborhood-level composition variables (percentage of Black residents, percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, and percentage of households below poverty) and interpolated PM2.5. Relationships were assessed in spatial lag models after adjustment for all composition variables. Models were fit with data both from the overall period and during high-pollution episodes associated with social events (July 4, 2021) and wildfires (July 23, 2021). Results. The spatial lag models showed that racial/ethnic composition variables were associated with higher PM2.5 levels. Levels were notably higher in neighborhoods with larger compositions of Hispanic/ Latinx residents across the entire study period and notably higher in neighborhoods with larger Black populations during the July 4 episode. Conclusions. As a complement to sparse regulatory networks, dense, low-cost sensor networks can capture spatial variations during short-term air pollution episodes and enable monitoring of neighborhood-level inequities in air pollution exposures in real time.},

   abstract = {Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air (C) have been suspected of contributing causally to increased acute (e.g., same-day or next-day) human mortality rates (R). We tested this causal hypothesis in 100 United States cities using the publicly available NMMAPS database. Although a significant, approximately linear, statistical C-R association exists in simple statistical models, closer analysis suggests that it is not causal. Surprisingly, conditioning on other variables that have been extensively considered in previous analyses (usually using splines or other smoothers to approximate their effects), such as month of the year and mean daily temperature, suggests that they create strong, nonlinear confounding that explains the statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality rates in this data set. As this finding disagrees with conventional wisdom, we apply several different techniques to examine it. Conditional independence tests for potential causation, nonparametric classification tree analysis, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and Granger- Sims causality testing, show no evidence that PM2.5 concentrations have any causal impact on increasing mortality rates. This apparent absence of a causal C-R relation, despite their statistical association, has potentially important implications for managing and communicating the uncertain health risks associated with, but not necessarily caused by, PM2.5 exposures. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.},

   abstract = {We present the findings of a new time-series model that estimates short-term health effects of particulate matter and ozone, as applied to three U.S. cities. The model is based on observed fluctuations of daily death counts and estimates the corresponding daily subpopulations at-risk of imminent death; it also shows that virtually all elderly deaths are preceded by a brief period of extreme frailty. We augment previous research by allowing new entrants to this at-risk population to be influenced by the environment, rather than be random. The mean frail subpopulations in the three cities, each containing between 3000 and 5000 daily observations on mortality, pollution, and temperature, are estimated to be about 0.1% of those aged 65 or more, and their life expectancies in this frail status are about one week. We find losses in life expectancy due to air pollution and temperature to be at most one day. Air pollution effects on new entrants into the frail population tend to exceed those on mortality. Our results provide context to the many time-series studies that have found significant short-term relationships between air quality and survival, and they suggest that benefits of air quality improvement should be based on increased life expectancy rather than estimated numbers of excess deaths.},

   abstract = {Residential environments are known to contribute to asthma. To examine the joint impacts of exposures to residential indoor and outdoor air pollutants and housing risk factors on adult asthma-related health outcomes. We analyzed &gt;1-year of data from 53 participants from 41 homes in the pre-intervention period of the Breathe Easy Project prior to ventilation and filtration retrofits. Health outcomes included surveys of asthma control, health-related quality of life, stress, and healthcare utilizations. Environmental assessments included quarterly measurements of indoor and outdoor pollutants (e.g., HCHO, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, and PM), home walk-throughs, and surveys of environmental risk factors. Indoor pollutant concentrations were also matched with surveys of time spent at home to estimate indoor pollutant exposures. Cross-sectional analyses using mixed-effects models indicated that lower annual average asthma control test (ACT) scores were associated (p &lt; 0.05) with higher indoor NO2 (concentration/exposure: β = −2.42/−1.57), indoor temperature (β = −1.03 to −0.94), and mold/dampness (β = −3.09 to −2.41). In longitudinal analysis, lower ACT scores were also associated (p &lt; 0.05) with higher indoor NO2 concentrations (β = −0.29), PM1 (concentration/exposure: β = −0.12/−0.24), PM2.5 (concentration/exposure: β = −0.12/−0.26), and PM10 (concentration/exposure: β = 10.14/-0.28). Emergency department visits were associated with poorer asthma control [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.84; p &lt; 0.001], physical health (IRR = 0.95; p &lt; 0.05), mental health (IRR = 0.95; p &lt; 0.05), higher I/O NO2 ratios (IRR = 1.30; p &lt; 0.05), and higher indoor temperatures (IRR = 1.41; p &lt; 0.05). Findings suggest that residential risk factors, including indoor air pollution (especially NO2 and particulate matter), higher indoor temperature, and mold/dampness, may contribute to poorer asthma control. This study highlights the importance of residential indoor air quality and environmental risk factors for asthma control, health-related quality of life, and emergency department visits for asthma. Two timescales of mixed models suggest that exposure to indoor NO2 and particulate matter, higher indoor temperature, and mold/dampness was associated with poorer asthma control. Additionally, emergency department visits were associated with poorer asthma control and health-related quality of life, as well as higher I/O NO2 ratios and indoor temperatures. These findings deepen our understanding of the interrelationships between housing, air quality, and health, and have important implications for programs and policy.},

   abstract = {Background: A number of studies have shown associations between chronic exposure to particulate air pollution and increased mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease, but fewer studies have examined the association between long-term exposure to the particulate air pollution and specific cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). objective: We examined how long-term exposure to area particulate matter affects the onset of AMI, and we distinguished between area and local pollutants. Methods: Building on the Worcester Heart Attack Study, an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in myocardial infarction incidence in greater Worcester, Massachusetts, we conducted a case-control study of 4,467 confirmed cases of AMI diagnosed between 1995 and 2003 and 9,072 matched controls selected from Massachusetts resident lists. We used a prediction model based on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements to generate both exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) at the area level (10 × 10 km) and the local level (100 m) based on local land use variables. We then examined the association between area and local particulate pollution and occurrence of AMI. results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in area PM2.5 (0.59 μg/m3) was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 1.04, 1.29). An IQR increase in total PM2.5 (area + local, 1.05 μg/m3) was weakly associated with a 4% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 0.96, 1.11). Conclusions: Residential exposure to PM2.5 may best be represented by a combination of area and local PM2.5, and it is important to consider spatial gradients within a single metropolitan area when examining the relationship between particulate matter exposure and cardiovascular events.},

   abstract = {Background: Pathophysiology of rhinitis in older adults is largely unknown. We tested whether air pollution is associated with this condition and how immune mechanisms may play a role in this relationship. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a nationally representative study of older adults born between 1920 and 1947. Particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) air pollution exposure estimates were generated using validated spatiotemporal models. Presence of rhinitis was defined based on medication use (≥1: intranasal medications: steroids, antihistamines, lubricants, and/or decongestants, and/or oral medications: antihistamines and/or decongestants). K-means cluster analysis (Jaccard method) was used to group 13 peripheral blood cytokines into 3 clusters to facilitate functional determination. We fitted multivariate logistic regressions to correlate PM2.5 exposure with presence of rhinitis, controlling for confounders, and then determined the role of cytokines in this relationship. Results: Long- (but not short-) term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with presence of rhinitis: 3-year exposure window, odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98, 1.80, per 1 standard deviation (SD) PM2.5 increase. Inclusion of cytokine cluster in the model led to a modestly stronger effect of PM2.5 exposure on rhinitis (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.87; 3-year exposure window). The particular immune profile responsible for this result was composed of elevated IL-3, IL-12, and IFN-γ (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.10, 21.58, immune profile-PM2.5 exposure interaction term). Conclusion: We show for the first time that IL-3, IL-12, and IFN-γ explain in part the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and rhinitis in older US adults. If confirmed, these immune pathways may be used as therapeutic targets.},

Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, * * *, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

   abstract = {Background: Several cohort studies report associations between chronic exposure to ambient fine particles (PM2.5) and cardiovascular mortality. Uncertainty exists about biological mechanisms responsible for this observation, but systemic inflammation has been postulated. In addition, the subgroups susceptible to inflammation have not been fully elucidated. Methods: We investigated whether certain subgroups are susceptible to the effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation directly linked to subsequent cardiovascular disease. We used data from the SWAN cohort of 1923 mid-life women with up to five annual repeated measures of CRP. Linear mixed and GEE models accounting for repeated measurements within an individual were used to estimate the effects of prior-year PM2.5 exposure on CRP. We examined CRP as a continuous and as binary outcome for CRP greater than 3. mg/l, a level of clinical significance. Results: We found strong associations between PM2.5 and CRP among several subgroups. For example a 10μg/m3 increase in annual PM2.5 more than doubled the risk of CRP greater than 3mg/l in older diabetics, smokers and the unmarried. Larger effects were also observed among those with low income, high blood pressure, or who were using hormone therapy, with indications of a protective effects for those using statins or consuming moderate amounts of alcohol. Conclusions: In this study, we observed significant associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and CRP in several susceptible subgroups. This suggests a plausible pathway by which exposure to particulate matter may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Weather extremes can affect many different assets, sectors and systems of the human environment, including human security, health and well-being. Weather extremes that compound, such as heat and drought, and their interconnected risks are complex, difficult to understand and thus a challenge for risk analysis and management, because (in intertwined systems) impacts can propagate through multiple sectors. In a warming climate, extreme concurrent heat and drought events are expected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration, posing growing risks to societies. To gain a better understanding of compound extremes and associated risks, we analyze eight historical heat and drought extreme events in Europe, Africa and Australia. We investigated and visualized the direct and indirect impact paths through different sectors and systems together with the impacts of response and adaptation measures. We found the most important cascading processes and interlinkages centered around the health, energy and agriculture and food production sectors. The key cascades result in impacts on the economy, the state and public services and ultimately also on society and culture. Our analysis shows that cascading impacts can propagate through numerous sectors with far reaching consequences, potentially being able to destabilize entire socio-economic systems. We emphasize that the future challenge in research on and adaptation to concurrent extreme events lies in the integration of assets, sectors and systems with strong interlinkages to other sectors and with a large potential for cascading impacts, but for which we cannot resort to historical experiences. Integrating approaches to deal with concurrent extreme events should furthermore consider the effects of possible response and adaptation mechanisms to increase system resilience.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies and models address the determinants of health. However, in existing models, the spatial aspects of the determinants are not or only marginally taken into account and a theoretical discussion of the association between space and the determinants of health is missing. The aim of this paper is to generate a framework that can be used to place the determinants of health in a spatial context. A screening of the current literature first serves to identify the relevant determinants and describes the current state of knowledge. In addition, spatial scales that are important for the spatial consideration of health were developed and discussed. Based on these two steps, the conceptual framework on the spatial determinants of health was derived and subsequently discussed. The results show a variety of determinants that are associated with health from a spatial point of view. The overarching categories are global driving forces, policy and governance, living and physical environment, socio-demographic and economic conditions, healthcare services and cultural and working conditions. Three spatial scales (macro, meso and micro) are further subdivided into six levels, such as global (e.g., continents), regional (e.g., council areas) or neighbourhood (e.g., communities). The combination of the determinants and spatial scales are presented within a conceptual framework as a result of this work. Operating mechanisms and pathways between the spatial levels were added schematically. This is the first conceptual framework that links the determinants of health with the spatial perspective. It can form the working basis for future analyses in which spatial aspects of health are taken into account.},

This paper summarizes the development of an open-source R package (AirSensor) and interactive web application (DataViewer) designed to address the environmental data science challenges of visualizing and understanding local air quality conditions with community networks of low-cost air quality sensors. AirSensor allows users to access historical data, add spatial metadata, and create maps and plots for viewing community monitoring data. The DataViewer application was developed to incorporate the functionality and plotting functions of the R package into a user-friendly web experience that would serve as the primary source for data communication for community-based organizations and citizen scientists.},

   abstract = {The potential health impact of ambient ozone and PM2.5 concentrations modulated by climate change over the United States is investigated using combined atmospheric and health modeling. Regional air quality modeling for 2001 and 2050 was conducted using CMAQ Modeling System with meteorology from the GISS Global Climate Model, downscaled regionally using MM5, keeping boundary conditions of air pollutants, emission sources, population, activity levels, and pollution controls constant. BenMap was employed to estimate the air pollution health outcomes at the county, state, and national level for 2050 caused by the effect of meteorology on future ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. The changes in calculated annual mean PM 2.5 concentrations show a relatively modest change with positive and negative responses (increasing PM2.5 levels across the northeastern U.S.) although average ozone levels slightly decrease across the northern sections of the U.S., and increase across the southern tier. Results suggest that climate change driven air quality-related health effects will be adversely affected in more than 2/3 of the continental U.S. Changes in health effects induced by PM2.5 dominate compared to those caused by ozone. PM 2.5-induced premature mortality is about 15 times higher than that due to ozone. Nationally the analysis suggests approximately 4000 additional annual premature deaths due to climate change impacts on PM2.5 vs 300 due to climate change-induced ozone changes. However, the impacts vary spatially. Increased premature mortality due to elevated ozone concentrations will be offset by lower mortality from reductions in PM2.5 in 11 states. Uncertainties related to different emissions projections used to simulate future climate, and the uncertainties forecasting the meteorology, are large although there are potentially important unaddressed uncertainties (e.g., downscaling, speciation, interaction, exposure, and concentration-response function of the human health studies). © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {We applied a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to study the correlations of total PM2.5 and its components with meteorological variables using an 11-year (1998-2008) observational record over the contiguous US. The data were deseasonalized and detrended to focus on synoptic-scale correlations. We find that daily variation in meteorology as described by the MLR can explain up to 50% of PM2.5 variability with temperature, relative humidity (RH), precipitation, and circulation all being important predictors. Temperature is positively correlated with sulfate, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) almost everywhere. The correlation of nitrate with temperature is negative in the Southeast but positive in California and the Great Plains. RH is positively correlated with sulfate and nitrate, but negatively with OC and EC. Precipitation is strongly negatively correlated with all PM2.5 components. We find that PM2.5 concentrations are on average 2.6 μg m-3 higher on stagnant vs. non-stagnant days. Our observed correlations provide a test for chemical transport models used to simulate the sensitivity of PM2.5 to climate change. They point to the importance of adequately representing the temperature dependence of agricultural, biogenic and wildfire emissions in these models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Climate change leads to more days with extremely hot temperatures. Previous analyses of heat waves have documented a short-term rise in mortality. The results on the relationship between high temperatures and hospitalisations, especially in vulnerable patients admitted to nursing homes, are inconsistent. The objective of this research was to examine the discrepancy between heat-related mortality and morbidity in nursing homes. A time-stratified case-crossover study about the impact of heat waves on mortality and hospitalisations between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 was conducted in 10 nursing homes over 5 years in Flanders, Belgium. In this study, the events were deaths and hospitalisations. We selected our control days during the same month as the events and matched them by day of the week. Heat waves were the exposure. Conditional logistic regression models were applied. The associations were reported as odds ratios at lag 0, 1, 2, and 3 and their 95% confidence intervals. In the investigated time period, 3048 hospitalisations took place and 1888 residents died. The conditional logistic regression showed that odds ratios of mortality and hospitalisations during heat waves were 1.61 (95% confidence interval 1.10–2.37) and 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.67–1.36), respectively, at lag 0. Therefore, the increase in mortality during heat waves was statistically significant, but no significant changes in hospitalisations were obtained. Our result suggests that heat waves have an adverse effect on mortality in Flemish nursing homes but have no significant effect on the number of hospitalisations.},

   abstract = {Background: in population-based studies, age and morbidity were associated with heat-related mortality. The nursing home population reveals both factors and may represent a highly vulnerable subgroup. Therefore, temperature-mortality relationship was examined in residents of nursing homes. Methods: the association between daily ambient maximum temperature and mortality was analysed in 95,808 nursing home residents in southwest Germany between 2001 and 2005. Time series analyses were applied across age groups, sex and functional abilities. In addition, excess mortality was determined for the 2003 heat wave. Results: mortality risk was lowest at maximum temperatures between 16 and 25.9°C. Risk increased by 26 and 62% at days of 32.0-33.9 and 34°C and more, respectively. In August 2003, heat caused >400 additional deaths in the observed population and was followed by only a moderate mortality displacement in the following months. The excess number of deaths during the heat wave was particularly high in residents aged >90 years and in residents with higher care needs. Conclusion: high ambient temperature was associated with an increased mortality risk in all analysed subgroups of the nursing home population. Medical competence and supervision are available in nursing homes and should, therefore, be favourable preconditions for the implementation of preventive measures. © The Author 2010.

In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 Köppen-Geiger climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii) the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena. This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions towards a more salutogenic urban design.},

   abstract = {Background Exposure to ambient air pollution increases morbidity and mortality, and is a leading contributor to global disease burden. We explored spatial and temporal trends in mortality and burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels. Methods We estimated global population-weighted mean concentrations of particle mass with aerodynamic diameter less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) and ozone at an approximate 11 km × 11 km resolution with satellite-based estimates, chemical transport models, and ground-level measurements. Using integrated exposure–response functions for each cause of death, we estimated the relative risk of mortality from ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infections from epidemiological studies using non-linear exposure–response functions spanning the global range of exposure. Findings Ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranking mortality risk factor in 2015. Exposure to PM2·5 caused 4·2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·7 million to 4·8 million) deaths and 103·1 million (90·8 million 115·1 million) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015, representing 7·6% of total global deaths and 4·2% of global DALYs, 59% of these in east and south Asia. Deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 increased from 3·5 million (95% UI 3·0 million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 4·2 million (3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 2015. Exposure to ozone caused an additional 254 000 (95% UI 97 000–422 000) deaths and a loss of 4·1 million (1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2015. Interpretation Ambient air pollution contributed substantially to the global burden of disease in 2015, which increased over the past 25 years, due to population ageing, changes in non-communicable disease rates, and increasing air pollution in low-income and middle-income countries. Modest reductions in burden will occur in the most polluted countries unless PM2·5 values are decreased substantially, but there is potential for substantial health benefits from exposure reduction.

Such conditions are projected to increase in line with CO2 emissions particularly in the humid tropics. Climate change can increase the risk of conditions that exceed human thermoregulatory capacity1,2,3,4,5,6. Although numerous studies report increased mortality associated with extreme heat events1,2,3,4,5,6,7, quantifying the global risk of heat-related mortality remains challenging due to a lack of comparable data on heat-related deaths2,3,4,5. Here we conducted a global analysis of documented lethal heat events to identify the climatic conditions associated with human death and then quantified the current and projected occurrence of such deadly climatic conditions worldwide. We reviewed papers published between 1980 and 2014, and found 783 cases of excess human mortality associated with heat from 164 cities in 36 countries. Based on the climatic conditions of those lethal heat events, we identified a global threshold beyond which daily mean surface air temperature and relative humidity become deadly. Around 30% of the world’s population is currently exposed to climatic conditions exceeding this deadly threshold for at least 20 days a year. By 2100, this percentage is projected to increase to ∼48% under a scenario with drastic reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and ∼74% under a scenario of growing emissions. An increasing threat to human life from excess heat now seems almost inevitable, but will be greatly aggravated if greenhouse gases are not considerably reduced.},

Timely, accurate, and frequent information on impervious surfaces is critical in both social-economic and natural environment applications. Over the past 40 years, impervious surface areas in China have grown rapidly. However, annual maps of impervious areas in China with high spatial details do not exist during this period. In this paper, we made use of reliable impervious surface mapping algorithms that we published before and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to address this data gap. With available data in GEE, we were able to map impervious surfaces over the entire country circa 1978, and during 1985–2017 at an annual frequency. The 1978 data were at 60-m resolution, while the 1985–2017 data were in 30-m resolution. For the 30-m resolution data, we evaluated the accuracies for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. Overall accuracies reached more than 90%. Our results indicate that the growth of impervious surface in China was not only fast but also considerably exceeding the per capita impervious surface area in developed countries like Japan. The 40-year continuous and consistent impervious surface distribution data in China would generate widespread interests in the research and policy-making community.

   abstract = {Accurate and timely population distribution maps are critical to addressing health epidemics, coordinating natural disaster response, tracking global changes for environmental conservation, confronting human rights issues, and more. Satellite imagery has opened numerous ways for mapping population distribution – previously unattainable without conducting a resource intensive census. While great advances have been made in urban population mapping, large gaps still exist for rural and remote populations which tend to be the most vulnerable to environmental, economic, and socio-political change. Moderate resolution remote sensing data, such as Landsat, has generally been viewed as insufficient for rural mapping given its coarseness relative to the size of a rural dwelling. This paper presents an approach for detecting small rural settlements within Ann Township of Rakhine State, a remote region of Myanmar with a highly mobile population, by combining Landsat data with publicly available auxiliary geospatial data. The key to the success of detecting small settlements at the Landsat resolution was the inclusion of multi-temporal auxiliary data sensitive to human activity patterns in the regions, such as distance to water, change in seasonal vegetation signals, and distance to a recent active fire. The use of active fire in this context is novel and provided a key metric that increased the accuracy of the resultant map. The final dataset has a classification accuracy of 86.5% on a per-pixel basis and 93.1% on a location identification basis. Numerous small settlements (on the order of 2–3 structures in some cases) not previously mapped by other datasets are identified, revealing that the population of Ann Township is far more dispersed and isolated than previously mapped. This study concludes that by incorporating regionally specific characteristics, moderate resolution remotely sensed data can be used to successfully map geographically marginalized communities so that services and aid are better able to reach them.},

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, census tracts from the US Census Bureau from 2014 were used to develop multidimensional SDOH indices and a regional typology of the continental United States at a small-area level (n = 71901 census tracts with approximately 312 million persons) using dimension reduction and clustering machine learning techniques (unsupervised algorithms used to reduce dimensions of multivariate data). The SDOH indices were used to estimate age-adjusted mortality rates in Chicago (n = 789 census tracts with approximately 7.5 million persons) with a spatial regression for the same period, while controlling for violent crime. Main Outcomes and Measures: Fifteen variables, measured as a 5-year mean, were selected to characterize SDOH as small-area variations for demographic characteristics of vulnerable groups, economic status, social and neighborhood characteristics, and housing and transportation availability at the census-tract level. This SDOH data matrix was reduced to 4 indices reflecting advantage, isolation, opportunity, and mixed immigrant cohesion and accessibility, which were then clustered into 7 distinct multidimensional neighborhood typologies. The association between SDOH indices and premature mortality (defined as death before age 75 years) in Chicago was measured by years of potential life lost and aggregated to a 5-year mean. Data analyses were conducted between July 1, 2018, and August 30, 2019. Results: Among the 71901 census tracts examined across the continental United States, a median (interquartile range) of 27.2% (47.1%) of residents had minority status, 12.1% (7.5%) had disabilities, 22.9% (7.6%) were 18 years and younger, and 13.6% (8.1%) were 65 years and older. Among the 789 census tracts examined in Chicago, a median (interquartile range) of 80.4% (56.3%) of residents had minority status, 10.2% (8.2%) had disabilities, 23.2% (10.9%) were 18 years and younger, and 9.5% (7.1%) were 65 years and older. Four SDOH indices accounted for 71% of the variance across all census tracts in the continental United States in 2014. The SDOH neighborhood typology of extreme poverty, which is of greatest concern to health care practitioners and policy advocates, comprised only 9.6% of all census tracts across the continental United States but characterized small areas of known public health crises. An association was observed between all SDOH indices and age-adjusted premature mortality rates in Chicago (R2 = 0.63; P <.001), even after accounting for violent crime and spatial structures. Conclusions and Relevance: The modeling of SDOH as multivariate indices rather than as a singular deprivation index may better capture the complexity and spatial heterogeneity underlying SDOH. During a time of increased attention to SDOH, this analysis may provide actionable information for key stakeholders with respect to the focus of interventions.},

   abstract = {Background: Heat-wave frequency, intensity, and duration are increasing with global climate change. The association between heat and mortality in the elderly is well documented, but less is known regarding associations with hospital admissions.
Objectives: Our goal was to determine associations between moderate and extreme heat, heat waves, and hospital admissions for nonaccidental causes among Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years of age in 114 cities across five U.S. climate zones.
Methods: We used Medicare inpatient billing records and city-specific data on temperature, humidity, and ozone from 1992 through 2006 in a time-stratified case-crossover design to estimate the association between hospitalization and moderate [90th percentile of apparent temperature (AT)] and extreme (99th percentile of AT) heat and heat waves (AT above the 95th percentile over 2–8 days). In sensitivity analyses, we additionally considered confounding by ozone and holidays, different temperature metrics, and alternate models of the exposure–response relationship.
Results: Associations between moderate heat and hospital admissions were minimal, but extreme heat was associated with a 3% (95% CI: 2%, 4%) increase in all-cause hospital admissions over the subsequent 8 days. In cause-specific analyses, extreme heat was associated with increased hospitalizations for renal (15%; 95% CI: 9%, 21%) and respiratory (4%; 95% CI: 2%, 7%) diseases, but not for cardiovascular diseases. An added heat-wave effect was observed for renal and respiratory admissions.
Conclusion: Extreme heat is associated with increased hospital admissions, particularly for renal causes, among the elderly in the United States.},

   abstract = {Objective: The objective of this paper is to analyse and quantify the effects exerted on summer mortality by extremes of heat, particularly among persons aged 65-74 and 75 years and over, groups in which mortality is higher. Methods: The study included the period from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1997, for all people aged over 65 years resident in Madrid, based on mortality due to all causes except accidents (ICD-9 codes 1-799), and circulatory (390-459) and respiratory (460-487) causes. Meteorological variables analysed were: daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature and relative humidity. To control the effect of air pollution on mortality we considered the daily mean values of sulphur dioxide (SO2), total suspended particulate (TSP), nitric oxides (NOx), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and trophospheric ozone (O3). Univariate and multivariate ARIMA models were used. Box-Jenkins pre-whitening was performed. Results: The results yielded by this study indicate a mortality increase up to 28.4% for every degree the temperature rises above 36.5% °C, with particular effect in women over the age of 75 years and circulatory-cause mortality. Te first heat wave that leads to the greatest effects on mortality, due to the higher number of susceptible people and the duration of the heat wave, show an exponential growth in the mortality. Futhermore, low relative humidity enhances the effects of high temperature, linking dryness to air pollutants, ozone in particular. Conclusions: Since a warmer climate is predicted in the future, the incidence of heat wave should increase, and more comprehensive measures, both medical and social, should be adopted to prevent the effects of extreme heat on the population, particularly the elderly. © Springer-Verlag 2001.},

This analysis examines reports of power outages in New York City in relation to socioeconomic and health characteristics of neighborhoods. Using the city's 311-call database we examine complaint calls for power outages from 2014 to 2022. While 311-calls for power outages occur all year long, volume trended higher during the warmer months (June, July and August), and as minimum daily temperatures exceeded 20 °C (68°F), the number of calls increased dramatically. Spatial clusters of high call areas were in Census tracts with high energy burdens, lower-income households, and high percentages of people of color. Furthermore, we found the higher call areas were associated with higher vulnerability to heat-exacerbated deaths. As climate change is expected to raise temperatures and increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves around the world, and as power outages are becoming more common, these findings will help to provide guidance for adaptation and energy reliability policies in New York City and have implications for other cities globally.},

Many questions regard the actual equation used in calculating the Heat Index. Some callers are satisfied with the response that it is extremely complicated. Some are satisfied with the nomogram (see Attachment 1). But there are a few who will settle for nothing less than the equation itself. No true equation for the Heat Index exists. Heat Index values are derived from a collection of equations that comprise a model. This Technical Attachment presents an equation that approximates the Heat Index and, thus, should satisfy the latter group of callers.

   abstract = {Asthma disproportionately affects non-whites in urban areas and those of low socioeconomic status, yet asthma's social patterning is not well-explained by known risk factors. We hypothesized that disadvantaged urban populations experience acute and chronic housing stressors which produce psychological stress and impact health through biological and behavioral pathways. We examined eight outcomes: six child respiratory outcomes as well as parent and child general health, using data from 682 low-income, Chicago parents of diagnosed and undiagnosed asthmatic children. We created a continuous exposure, representing material, social and emotional dimensions of housing stressors, weighted by their parent-reported difficulty. We compared the 75th to the 25th quartile of exposure in adjusted binomial and negative binomial regression models. Higher risks and rates of poor health were associated with higher housing stressors for six of eight outcomes. The risk difference (RD) for poor/fair general health was larger for children [RD = 6.28 (95% CI 1.22, 11.35)] than for parents [RD=3.88 (95% CI -1.87, 9.63)]. The incidence rate difference (IRD) for exercise intolerance was nearly one extra day per 2 weeks for the higher exposure group [IRD=0.88 (95% CI 0.41, 1.35)]; nearly one-third extra day per 2 weeks for waking at night [IRD = 0.32 (95% CI 0.01, 0.63)]; and nearly one-third extra day per 6 months for unplanned medical visits [IRD=0.30 (95% CI 0.059, 0.54)]. Results contribute to the conceptualization of urban stress as a "social pollutant" and to the hypothesized role of stress in health disparities. Interventions to improve asthma outcomes must address individuals' reactions to stress while we seek structural solutions to residential stressors and health inequities. © 2010 The New York Academy of Medicine.},

Racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income groups in the USA are at a higher risk of death from exposure to PM2.5 than are other population/income groups2–5. Moreover, disparities in exposure to air pollution among population and income groups are known to exist6–17. Here we develop a data platform that links demographic data (from the US Census Bureau and American Community Survey) and PM2.5 data18 across the USA. We analyse the data at the tabulation area level of US zip codes (N is approximately 32,000)&nbsp;between 2000 and 2016. We show that areas with higher-than-average white and Native American populations have been consistently exposed to average PM2.5 levels that are lower than areas with higher-than-average Black, Asian and Hispanic or Latino populations. Moreover, areas with low-income populations have been consistently exposed to higher average PM2.5 levels than areas with high-income groups for the years 2004–2016. Furthermore, disparities in exposure relative to safety standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency19 and the World Health Organization20 have been increasing over time. Our findings suggest that more-targeted PM2.5 reductions are necessary to provide all people with a similar degree of protection from environmental hazards. Our study is observational and cannot provide insight into the drivers of the identified disparities. Different racial/ethnic populations and income groups are found to have been exposed to different levels of air pollution in the USA during the years 2000 to 2016.},

Here we present the first national-scale analysis of the relationship between outdoor PM2.5 exposure and PHD residency in the US, as well as exposure disparities within the population of households residing in PHDs. We integrated data on average annual PM2.5 concentrations (2011–2015) with US Department of Housing and Urban Development data on PHDs (2015), and socio-demographic information from the 2011–2015 American Community Survey. Results from multivariable generalized estimating equations indicated that PHD locations, units, and residents are significantly overrepresented in neighborhoods with greater PM2.5 exposure, after accounting for clustering, urbanization, and other socio-demographic factors. Additionally, significantly higher percentages of Black, Hispanic, disabled, and extremely low-income households reside in PHDs with greater PM2.5 exposure. Findings represent an important starting point for future research and emphasize the urgent need to identify gaps in environmental, public health, and housing policies that contribute to disproportionate air pollution exposures among PHD residents.},

Annual average PM2.5 and ozone levels were estimated using high-resolution spatio-temporal models. We fit a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model, using stabilized inverse probability weights (IPWs) to account for the competing risk of death and confounding. Analyses were then repeated after restricting to exposure levels below the current U.S. standards. The results showed that PM2.5 was significantly associated with an increased hazard of admissions for all studied outcomes; the highest observed being a 6.1% (95% CI: 5.9%–6.2%) increase in the hazard of admissions with pneumonia for each μg/m3 increase in particulate levels. Ozone was also significantly associated with an increase in the risk of first hospital admissions of all outcomes. The hazard of pneumonia increased by 3.0% (95% CI: 2.9%–3.1%) for each ppb increase in the ozone level. Our results reveal a need to regulate long-term ozone exposure, and that associations persist below current PM2.5 standards.},

   abstract = {Low-cost air pollution monitors are increasingly being deployed to enrich knowledge about ambient air-pollution at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, unlike regulatory-grade (FEM or FRM) instruments, universal quality standards for low-cost sensors are yet to be established and their data quality varies widely. This mandates thorough evaluation and calibration before any responsible use of such data. This study presents evaluation and field-calibration of the PM2.5 data from a network of low-cost monitors currently operating in Baltimore, MD, which has only one regulatory PM2.5 monitoring site within city limits. Co-location analysis at this regulatory site in Oldtown, Baltimore revealed high variability and significant overestimation of PM2.5 levels by the raw data from these monitors. Universal laboratory corrections reduced the bias in the data, but only partially mitigated the high variability. Eight months of field co-location data at Oldtown were used to develop a gain-offset calibration model, recast as a multiple linear regression. The statistical model offered substantial improvement in prediction quality over the raw or lab-corrected data. The results were robust to the choice of the low-cost monitor used for field-calibration, as well as to different seasonal choices of training period. The raw, lab-corrected and statistically-calibrated data were evaluated for a period of two months following the training period. The statistical model had the highest agreement with the reference data, producing a 24-h average root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of around 2 μgm−3. To assess transferability of the calibration equations to other monitors in the network, a cross-site evaluation was conducted at a second co-location site in suburban Essex, MD. The statistically calibrated data once again produced the lowest RMSE. The calibrated PM2.5 readings from the monitors in the low-cost network provided insights into the intra-urban spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 in Baltimore.},

Ensuring data reliability during continuous operation is critical for these sensor networks. Using particulate matter sensor as an example, this study reports a data quality control method, including sensor selection, pre-calibration, and online inspection. It was used in developing and operating the dense low-cost particle sensor networks in two Chinese cities. Firstly, seven mainstream sensors were tested and one model of particle sensor was selected due to its better linearity and stability. For a batch of sensors of the same model, although they were calibrated after manufactured, there are differences in response toward the same concentration of pollutants. The systematical variation of sensors was corrected and unified through pre-calibration. After deploying them in the field, a data analysis method is established for online inspecting their working status. Using data from these sensors, it evaluates parameters such as intraclass correlation coefficients and normalized root mean square error. These two metrics help to construct a two-dimensional coordinate system and to classify sensors into four status, including normal, fluctuation, hotspots, and malfunction. During a one-month operation in the two cities, 8 (out of 82) and 10 (out of 59) sensors with suspected malfunctions were screened out for further on-site inspection. Moreover, the sensor networks show potential in identifying illegal emission sources that cannot be typically detected by sparse regulatory air quality monitoring stations.},

For this problem, this study analyzed sound trends using Array of Things (AoT) sensing data. Additionally, this study explored the influences on the spatial differentiation of sound using GeoDetector (version number: 1.0-4), thus addressing the limitation of previous studies that neglected to explore the influences on spatial heterogeneity. Our experimental results showed that sound levels in different areas of Chicago fluctuated irregularly over time. During the morning peak on weekdays: the four southern areas of Chicago have a high–high sound gathering mode, and the remaining areas are mostly randomly distributed; the sound level of a certain area has a significant negative correlation with population density, park area, and density of bike route; park area and population density are the main factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of Chicago’s sound; and population density and park area play an essential role in factor interaction. This study has some theoretical significance and practical value. Residents can choose areas with lower noise for leisure activities according to the noise map of this study. While planning urban development, urban planners should pay attention to the single and interactive effects of factors in the city, such as parks, road network structures, and points of interest, on the urban sound environment. Researchers can build on this study to conduct studies on larger time scales.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have cataloged social disparities in air pollution exposure in US public schools with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. These studies rely upon chronic, averaged measures of air pollution, which fosters a static conception of exposure disparities. This paper examines PM2.5 exposure disparities in Salt Lake County (SLC), Utah public schools under three different PM2.5 scenarios—relatively clean air, a moderate winter persistent cold air pool (PCAP), and a major winter PCAP—with respect to race/ethnicity, economic deprivation, student age, and school type. We pair demographic data for SLC schools (n = 174) with modelled PM2.5 values, obtained from a distributed network of sensors placed through a community-university partnership. Results from generalized estimating equations controlling for school district clustering and other covariates reveal that patterns of social inequality vary under different PM2.5 pollution scenarios. Charter schools and schools serving economically deprived students experienced disproportionate exposure during relatively clean air and moderate PM2.5 PCAP conditions, but those inequalities attenuated under major PCAP conditions. Schools with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority students were unequally exposed under all PM2.5 pollution scenarios, reflecting the robustness of racial/ethnic disparities in exposure. The findings speak to the need for policy changes to protect school-aged children from environmental harm in SLC and elsewhere.},

   abstract = { Due to climate change and rapid urbanization, Urban Heat Island (UHI), featuring significantly higher temperature in metropolitan areas than surrounding areas, has caused negative impacts on urban communities. Temporal granularity is often limited in UHI studies based on satellite remote sensing data that typically has multi-day frequency coverage of a particular urban area. This low temporal frequency has restricted the development of models for predicting UHI. To resolve this limitation, this study has developed a cyber-based geographic information science and systems (cyberGIS) framework encompassing multiple machine learning models for predicting UHI with high-frequency urban sensor network data combined with remote sensing data focused on Chicago, Illinois, from 2018 to 2020. Enabled by rapid advances in urban sensor network technologies and high-performance computing, this framework is designed to predict UHI in Chicago with fine spatiotemporal granularity based on environmental data collected with the Array of Things (AoT) urban sensor network and Landsat-8 remote sensing imagery. Our computational experiments revealed that a random forest regression (RFR) model outperforms other models with the prediction accuracy of 0.45 degree Celsius in 2020 and 0.8 degree Celsius in 2018 and 2019 with mean absolute error as the evaluation metric. Humidity, distance to geographic center, and PM 2.5 concentration are identified as important factors contributing to the model performance. Furthermore, we estimate UHI in Chicago with 10-min temporal frequency and 1-km spatial resolution on the hottest day in 2018. It is demonstrated that the RFR model can accurately predict UHI at fine spatiotemporal scales with high-frequency urban sensor network data integrated with satellite remote sensing data. },

To date, limited studies, if any, have been conducted to utilize low-cost sensor measurements to improve PM2.5 prediction with high spatiotemporal resolutions based on statistical models. Imperial County in California is an exemplary region with sparse Air Quality System (AQS) monitors and a community-operated low-cost network entitled Identifying Violations Affecting Neighborhoods (IVAN). This study aims to evaluate the contribution of IVAN measurements to the quality of PM2.5 prediction. We adopted the Random Forest algorithm to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at a 1-km spatial resolution using three different PM2.5 datasets (AQS-only, IVAN-only, and AQS/IVAN combined). The results show that the integration of low-cost sensor measurements is an effective way to significantly improve the quality of PM2.5 prediction with an increase of cross-validation (CV) R2 by ~0.2. The IVAN measurements also contributed to the increased importance of emission source-related covariates and more reasonable spatial patterns of PM2.5. The remaining uncertainty in the calibrated IVAN measurements could still cause apparent outliers in the prediction model, highlighting the need for more effective calibration or integration methods to relieve its negative impact.},

Machine learning offers promising tools for high-resolution modeling of urban heat, but it requires large amounts of data. Measurements from official weather stations are too sparse but could be complemented by crowd-sensed measurements from citizen weather stations (CWS). Here we present an approach to model urban temperature using the quantile regression forest algorithm and CWS, open government and remote sensing data. The analysis is based on data from 691 sensors in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) during a heat wave using data from for 25-30th June 2019. We trained the model using hourly data from for 25-29th June (n = 71,837) and evaluate the model using data from June 30th (n = 14,105). Based on the model, spatiotemporal temperature maps of 10 × 10 m resolution were produced. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately map urban heat at high spatial and temporal resolution without additional measurement infrastructure. We furthermore critically discuss and spatially map estimated prediction and extrapolation uncertainty. Our approach is able to inform highly localized urban policy and decision-making.},

   abstract = {Achieving environmental justice—that is, the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies—requires providing impacted communities not just the formal right, but the substantive ability, to participate as equal partners at every level of environmental decision-making. While established administrative policy purports to provide all people with so-called meaningful involvement in the regulatory process, the public participation process often excludes marginalized community members from exerting meaningful influence on decision-making. Especially in the environmental arena, regulatory decisions are often buried among engineering analyses or modeling assumptions. This Article theorizes and calls for an empowered participatory process—one that provides environmental justice communities (those that are disproportionately exposed to pollution) with the consultation and technical expertise needed to bolster the authority of their lived experiences in order to substantively influence regulatory outcomes. While scholars and advocates have rightly foregrounded certain disparities in regulatory outcomes (for example, decisions about where facilities should be located and where enforcement resources are invested), far less attention is paid to the decision-making process that governs what pollution controls can, should, or must be installed. Yet these decisions legalize acceptable levels of pollution that a community must bear and sanction those levels for a generation to come. Environmental justice communities can—if properly supported—push back against inadequate or cursory approvals of what controls are implemented to reduce or avoid pollution. They can even press for better or alternative controls, buttressing recommendations with technical advocacy. Ultimately, this support can help improve administrative decision-making and reinforces a central tenet of the environmental justice movement—that communities be empowered to speak for themselves.},

Six major cities were analyzed, namely Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Brasília, Cuiabá, Porto Velho, and Manaus, each characterized by distinct climatic conditions. Climate normals were obtained from the network of the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology (INMET) whereas heat stress data represented by the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) were retrieved from the ERA5-HEAT reanalysis dataset. Urbanization was interpreted as changes in impervious surfaces observed from satellite imagery, which allowed us to identify the growth and spread of the impervious area in the cities. A consistent but not uniform rise in temperature and heat stress was found in the evaluated locations, with a more pronounced rise in heat stress in low-latitude locations. Among temperature-and thermal stress-related variables, the increase in impervious surfaces appears to correlate more strongly to a rise in maximum temperatures and in the average UTCI, with statistically significant impact on changes in the 'moderate heat stress' class of the UTCI. The consideration of the breakdown of degrees of imperviousness over urban areas has been found to be more defining of changes in local climate conditions than the bulk change in impervious surfaces over time.},

Furthermore, recent events in regions where wildfire does not constitute a frequent hazard (e.g. Siberia, Scandinavia) indicated that the spatial pattern of wildfire risk might have significantly changed. To prepare for upcoming extreme events, it is critical for decision-makers to have a thorough understanding of the vulnerability of the built environment to wildfire. Building quality and design standards are important not only because building loss is costly but also because robust buildings may offer shelter when evacuation is not possible. However, studies aiming at the analysis of wildfire vulnerability for the built environment are limited. This paper presents an innovative solution for the vulnerability assessment to wildfires, making use of an all-relevant feature selection algorithm established on statistical relationships to develop a physical vulnerability index for buildings subject to wildfire. Data from a recent and systematically documented wildfire event in Greece (Mati, 2018) are used to select and weight the relevant indicators using a permutation-based automated feature selection based on random forests. Building characteristics including the structural type, the roof type, material and shape, the inclination of the ground, the surrounding vegetation, the material of the shutters and the ground covering were selected and formed into the index. The index may be used in other places in Europe and beyond, especially where no empirical data are available supporting decision-making and risk reduction of an emerging hazard amplified by climate change.},

Based on three years of mixed-methods qualitative research among social service practitioners, landlords and residents of mobile and manufactured housing (MH) communities, we argue that thermal insecurity is a socially produced, rather than intrinsic, feature of MH. We use the thermal struggles of MH residents to illustrate how gaps in research, markets, landlord-tenant law, policy, and specific government programs overlap to produce MH as a site of hyper-exclusion from many tools used to mitigate and adapt to climate risk. We find that most MH residents, despite barriers and a warming climate, are able to maintain some level of HTS. We highlight the small-scale, improvisational strategies that households use to cope and adapt to the extreme temperatures. HTS is an achievement sustained by a variety of elements that cannot be reduced to simple metrics (e.g., presence of air conditioning). We conclude with a practical set of policy recommendations as well as a call for an expansive "climate finance" that includes the improvisational practices of excluded groups as innovations worth learning from and investing in.},

First, how do heat risk measures vary by housing type and location in San José, California? Second, what housing and neighborhood factors are associated with greater heat risk? We first create a parcel dataset with housing, heat risk, and neighborhood characteristics. We then use a combination of descriptive statistics, exploratory mapping, and linear regression models to analyze associations between housing, neighborhoods, and heat risk. The results indicate that households of different housing types face varying degrees of heat risk, and the largest disparities are between detached single-family (lowest heat risk) and multifamily rental (highest heat risk). Air conditioning availability is a major contributing factor: the probability of not having central air conditioning is much lower for detached single-family (44.9%) compared with multifamily rental (73.7%). There are also heat risk disparities for households in neighborhoods with larger proportions of Hispanic and Asian residents. This research demonstrates the need to understand heat risk at the parcel scale and suggests to policymakers the importance of heat mitigation strategies that focus on multifamily rental housing and communities of color.},

However, there is limited information about variation in the IHE by race/ethnicity among the population with disabilities. Objective: This study summarizes the IHE among households with any person with a disability (HWDs) and describes differences by race/ethnicity. The study evaluates whether these racial/ethnic differences are accounted for by demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics. Methods: Using a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey, descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine racial/ethnic differences across eight inadequate conditions of the IHE and the total number of inadequate conditions of the IHE. Results: Some IHE conditions are common, such as low indoor air quality. Large racial/ethnic differences in exposure persist, net of controls. Black, Hispanic, and Mixed Race/Ethnicity HWDs have greater exposure to low indoor temperatures, injury hazards, and lead than White HWDs. Black and Hispanic HWDs reside in dwellings with lower indoor air quality and pests/allergens than White HWDs. Mixed Race/Ethnicity HWDs are the only racial/ethnic minority group with greater barriers to water and sanitation than White HWDs. Asian households have comparable exposure to White households for all IHE conditions. Black, Hispanic, and Mixed Race/Ethnicity HWDs have about 23%, 17%, and 15% more inadequate conditions of the IHE than White HWDs, net of controls. Conclusion: There is heterogeneity in exposure to inadequate conditions of the IHE, with Black, Hispanic, and Mixed Race/Ethnicity HWDs at a disadvantage compared to their White counterparts. It is critical to examine racial/ethnic variation when studying health inequalities in the IHE among HWDs.},

Here, we develop a framework using Net Energy Analysis and household socioeconomic data to measure systematic energy inequity among critical groups that need policy attention. We find substantial instances of energy poverty in the United States – 16% of households experience energy poverty as presently defined as spending more than 6% of household income on energy expenditures. More than 5.2 million households above the Federal Poverty Line face energy poverty, disproportionately burdening Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities. For solar, wind, and energy efficiency to address socioeconomic mobility, programs must reduce energy expenditures by expanding eligibility requirements for support and access to improved conservation measures, efficiency upgrades, and distributed renewables. We recommend the United States develop a more inclusive federal energy poverty categorization that increases assistance for household energy costs. Net energy metrics reveal disparities in United States household energy burdens.

   abstract = {Understanding changes in the built environment is vital for sustainable urban development and disaster preparedness. Recent years have seen the emergence of a variety of global, continent-level, and nation-wide datasets related to the current state and the evolution of the built environment, human settlements or building stocks.&nbsp;However, such datasets may&nbsp;face limitations like incomplete coverage, sparse building information, coarse resolution, and limited timeframes. This study addresses these challenges by integrating three spatial datasets to create an extensive, attribute-rich sequence of settlement layers spanning 200 years for the contiguous U.S. This integration process involves complex data processing, merging property-level real estate, parcel, and remote sensing-based building footprint data, and creating gridded multi-temporal settlement layers. This effort unveils the latest edition (Version 2)&nbsp;of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US), which includes the latest land use and structural information as of the year 2021. It enables detailed research on urban form and structure, helps assess and map the built environment’s risk to natural hazards, assists in population modeling, supports land use analysis, and aids health studies.},

   abstract = {(1) Background: Tornadoes are one of the deadliest disasters but their health impacts in China are poorly investigated. This study aimed to assess the public health risks and impact of an EF-4 tornado outbreak in Funing, China; (2) Methods: A retrospective analysis on the characteristics of tornado-related deaths and injuries was conducted based on the database from the Funing’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Funing People’s Hospital. A change-point time-series analysis of weekly incidence for the period January 2010 to September 2016 was used to identify sensitive infectious diseases to the tornado; (3) Results: The 75 to 84 years old group was at the highest risk of both death (RR = 82.16; 95% CIs = 19.66, 343.33) and injury (RR = 31.80; 95% CI = 17.26, 58.61), and females were at 53% higher risk of death than males (RR = 1.53; 95% CIs = 1.02, 2.29). Of the 337 injuries, 274 injuries (81%) were minor. Most deaths occurred indoors (87%) and the head (74%) was the most frequent site of trauma during the tornado. Five diseases showed downward change-points; (4) Conclusions: The experience of the Funing tornado underscores the relative danger of being indoors during a tornado and is successful in avoiding epidemics post-tornado. Current international safety guidelines need modification when generalized to China.},

However, no existing unified conceptual model has comprehensively elucidated the relationship between housing and health equity with attention to the full range of harmful exposures, their cumulative burden and their historical production. We synthesized literature from a diverse array of disciplines to explore the varied aspects of the relationship between housing and health and developed an original conceptual model highlighting these complexities. This holistic conceptual model of the impact of housing on health disparities illustrates how structural inequalities shape unequal distribution of access to health-promoting housing factors, which span four pillars: 1) cost (housing affordability); 2) conditions (housing quality); 3) consistency (residential stability); and 4) context (neighborhood opportunity). We further demonstrate that these four pillars can lead to cumulative burden by interacting with one another and with other structurally-rooted inequalities to produce and reify health disparities. We conclude by offering a comprehensive vision for healthy housing that situates housing's impact on health through a historical and social justice lens, which can help to better design policies and interventions that use housing to promote health equity.},

This paper details the impacts of the hurricane of September 1947 on New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, and its relationship with the urban development and expansion efforts undertaken during and after the Second World War of 1939-45. New Orleans' newest drainage and shipping canals, which were a major part of its mid-twentieth century development initiative, funnelled the storm surge into the city, a pattern that would repeat itself in subsequent years. Unlike more infamous hurricanes, such as Betsy and Katrina of 1965 and 2005, respectively, the 1947 event is not well-known among disaster researchers. Yet, it provides a fundamental example of how local elites have continuously exacerbated flood risk throughout the city and surrounding area, leaving it simultaneously dependent on and endangered by its embedded system of drainage and shipping canals.},

However, these impacts may be exacerbated by coastal subsidence—the sinking of coastal land areas <sup>4</sup> —a factor that is often underrepresented in coastal-management policies and long-term urban planning <sup>2,5</sup> . In this study, we combine high-resolution vertical land motion (that is, raising or lowering of land) and elevation datasets with projections of sea-level rise to quantify the potential inundated areas in 32 major US coastal cities. Here we show that, even when considering the current coastal-defence structures, further land area of between 1,006 and 1,389 km <sup>2</sup> is threatened by relative sea-level rise by 2050, posing a threat to a population of 55,000–273,000 people and 31,000–171,000 properties. Our analysis shows that not accounting for spatially variable land subsidence within the cities may lead to inaccurate projections of expected exposure. These potential consequences show the scale of the adaptation challenge, which is not appreciated in most US coastal cities. </p>},

I integrate manufacturing decline in metropolitan areas into the study of environmental inequality by using data on industrial air pollution in 1990, 2000, and 2010. I test to see if an indicator of change in the number of manufacturing workers in a metropolitan area from 1970 to each of the three study years is associated with more or less industrially produced toxic emissions. Findings show, somewhat counterintuitively, that metropolitan areas that have had a larger drop in manufacturing work are linked to greater industrial air pollution and that these findings hold in all U.S. regions except the West. Implications focus on how the indelible imprint of manufacturing history may condition contemporary pollution levels.},

There has not been a single comprehensive study to date that assesses where mobile home parks (MHPs) are located within metropolitan areas, that explores why some neighborhoods have a greater concentration of MHPs than others, or examines what environmental or basic service conditions are like in those neighborhoods. In California, more than 1 million residents live in mobile homes, with the vast majority (75%) of these living in MHPs rather than standalone units. We answer two questions in this study. First, are MHPs in “worse” neighborhoods in terms of socioeconomic status, zoning, local land uses, accessibility to jobs, and environmental quality? Second, which neighborhood factors are most strongly correlated with MHP locations and concentrations? We answer these questions using data for all mobile home parks in Los Angeles County, California. We find that MHPs are more likely to be located in lower density neighborhoods and at the urban fringe. More than 41% of MHPs are in areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes rather than residential uses. Not surprisingly then, we find that MHPs are located in areas with more environmental hazards. A multivariate analysis of neighborhood factors confirms our hypotheses. Moreover, we find that MHPs’ access to public services is worse than the average neighborhood in the county. We recommend that policymakers engage in targeted efforts to address disparities in service access and mitigate environmental hazards.},

PM2.5 concentrations and chemical compositions measured in metropolitan area of New York City are uniform. About 69-82% of PM2.5 mass derives from transport. The most important constituents of the PM2.5 were SO42 -, NH4 and NO3- and account 54-67% of PM2.5 mass. More than 93% of SO42 - and about 54-65% of NO3- are likely to have been transported into the NYC area based on the concentrations observed at the background site. Backward air parcel trajectories indicate that coal-fired power plants in the border area among West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania are related to typical high PM2.5 events having peak secondary pollutant concentrations in New York City. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify the PM2.5 sources and estimate the source contributions. Sources common to all five sites included secondary sulfate, secondary nitrate, soil and aged sea salt. Oil combustion was identified at four of the sites. At the Elizabeth site, the oil combustion source appears to show an influence from ship emissions. Motor vehicles were apportioned into two sources (gasoline and diesel) at three site and three sources at the Elizabeth site, probably because of its proximity to a major interstate highway. At the Queens College site, only a combined motor vehicle factor could be resolved. The source profiles, source contributions and seasonal or weekday variations derived by PMF are compared to source inventories for the area. It appears that there were more vehicle exhausts and less dust and wood smoke than are indicated by the source inventories. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A review on the PM2.5 related research is necessary. We start with summary of chemical composition and characteristics of PM2.5 that contains both macro and micro observation results and analysis, wherein the temporal variability of concentrations of PM2.5 and major components in many recent reports is embraced. This is closely followed by an overview of source appointment, including the composition and sources of PM2.5 in different countries in the six inhabitable continents based on the best available results. Besides summarizing PM2.5 pollution countermeasures by policy, planning, technology and ideology, the World Air Day is proposed to be established to inspire and promote the crucial social action in energy-saving and emission-reduction. Some updated knowledge of the important topics (such as formation and evolution mechanisms of hazes, secondary aerosols, aerosol mass spectrometer, organic tracers, radiocarbon, emissions, solutions for air pollution problems, etc.) is also included in the present review by logically synthesizing the studies. In addition, the key research challenges and future directions are put forward. Despite our efforts, our understanding of the recent reported observations, source identifications and countermeasures of PM2.5 is limited, and subsequent efforts both of the authors and readers are needed.},

   abstract = {• The influencing factors of PM2.5 concentration in different regions were analyzed. • Deep learning was better at simulating PM2.5 concentration than multiple linear regression. • Cluster analysis was performed on PM2.5 and its influencing factors. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important indicator to measure the degree of air pollution. With the pursuit of sustainable development of China's economy and society, air pollution has been paid more and more attention. The spatial distribution of PM2.5 is affected by multiple factors. In this study, we selected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, temperature, wind speed and elevation data to analyze the impact of each variable on PM2.5 in different regions of China. The results show that the high-value areas of PM2.5 were mainly concentrated in the North China Plain, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Tarim Basin. PM2.5 showed an upward trend in North China, Northeast China and Northwest China, while in most of South China, especially the Sichuan Basin, PM2.5 showed a downward trend. Therefore, the northern region of China needs to take measures to curb the growth of PM2.5. In Northwest China, wind speed and temperature had a greater impact on PM2.5. In North China, wind speed had a greater impact on PM2.5. In southern China, temperature and NDVI had a greater impact on PM2.5. The deep learning model can better simulate the spatial distribution of PM2.5 based on the selected variables. The clustering effect of single variable is better than multivariate spatial information clustering based on principal component analysis (PCA). It is difficult to explain which variable has the greatest impact on PCA clustering. This study can provide an important reference for PM2.5 prevention and control in different regions of China.

Variables like normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface reflectance, absorbing aerosol index, and meteoroidal fields are also informative about PM2.5 concentrations. Our objective is to establish a hybrid model which incorporates multiple approaches and input variables to improve model performance. To account for complex atmospheric mechanisms, we used a neural network for its capacity to model nonlinearity and interactions. We used convolutional layers, which aggregate neighboring information, into a neural network to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We trained the neural network for the continental United States from 2000 to 2012 and tested it with left out monitors. Ten-fold cross-validation revealed a good model performance with a total R2 of 0.84 on the left out monitors. Regional R2 could be even higher for the Eastern and Central United States. Model performance was still good at low PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we used the trained neural network to make daily predictions of PM2.5 at 1 km × 1 km grid cells. This model allows epidemiologists to access PM2.5 exposure in both the short-term and the long-term.},

   abstract = {Exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a leading risk factor for mortality. We develop global estimates of annual PM2.5 concentrations and trends for 1998-2018 using advances in satellite observations, chemical transport modeling, and ground-based monitoring. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) from advanced satellite products including finer resolution, increased global coverage, and improved long-term stability are combined and related to surface PM2.5 concentrations using geophysical relationships between surface PM2.5 and AOD simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with updated algorithms. The resultant annual mean geophysical PM2.5 estimates are highly consistent with globally distributed ground monitors (R2 = 0.81; slope = 0.90). Geographically weighted regression is applied to the geophysical PM2.5 estimates to predict and account for the residual bias with PM2.5 monitors, yielding even higher cross validated agreement (R2 = 0.90-0.92; slope = 0.90-0.97) with ground monitors and improved agreement compared to all earlier global estimates. The consistent long-term satellite AOD and simulation enable trend assessment over a 21 year period, identifying significant trends for eastern North America (-0.28 ± 0.03 μg/m3/yr), Europe (-0.15 ± 0.03 μg/m3/yr), India (1.13 ± 0.15 μg/m3/yr), and globally (0.04 ± 0.02 μg/m3/yr). The positive trend (2.44 ± 0.44 μg/m3/yr) for India over 2005-2013 and the negative trend (-3.37 ± 0.38 μg/m3/yr) for China over 2011-2018 are remarkable, with implications for the health of billions of people.},

   abstract = {In 2016, an intense drought occurred in the southeastern U.S. Dry conditions resulted in unprecedented wildfires throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains, especially in western North Carolina (WNC). Future climate change is expected to increase temperatures, alter precipitation, and stress water resources in the region, which could lead to more frequent drought and wildfire. The increasing threat of destructive wildfires combined with a growing wildland-urban interface indicate a need for a comprehensive assessment of wildfire vulnerability in WNC, while recent wildfires offer an opportunity to evaluate assessment accuracy. The study identifies locations vulnerable to wildfire in WNC based on wildfires from 1985 through 2016. By combining tract-level socioeconomic and physical data in a geographic information system, specific locations of vulnerability were identified and validated using wildfire perimeters from 2016. Unlike previous vulnerability research, this study integrates novel methods in GIS, including analytical hierarchical processing, validation, and GIS multi-decision criteria decision making to ensure vulnerability is accurately calculated. The vulnerability index indicates that social vulnerability varies greatly throughout the region, while physical and overall wildfire vulnerability is greatest in rural, mountainous portions of the region, which are less equipped for mitigation. Based on the results, the impacts of future wildfires on quality of life will vary across the region, so targeted responses are needed. The vulnerability index provides transparency to vulnerable communities, enabling policymakers to identify opportunities to prepare for resilience by targeting vulnerability hotspots.},

   abstract = {Coastal vulnerability is a spatial concept that identifies people and places that are susceptible to disturbances resulting from coastal hazards. Hazards in the coastal environment, such as coastal storms and erosion, pose significant threats to coastal physical, economic, and social systems. The theory of vulnerability has been an evolving idea over the past hundred years. In recent decades, improved technology and high-profile disaster events, has caused an increase in publications in the coastal hazards field. Modern approaches to understanding coastal vulnerability examine the complex systems that determine the spatial distribution of hazards, risks, and exposure. Consensus among today's researchers shows that coastal vulnerability is geographically dependent and requires place based investigations. This review examines over 200 coastal vulnerability related works. Through this extensive literature review, this research describes the evolution of vulnerability concepts, and the modern definition of vulnerability with the goal of providing a well-informed body of knowledge to be used in the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability in coastal areas.},

These expose not only human vulnerability - particularly that of the poorest, who are least able to respond and adapt - but also the profound worldwide environmental injustices that result from the geographical distribution of risks, hazards and disasters. This collection of essays, from one of the most renowned and experienced experts, provides a timely assessment of these critical themes. Presenting the top selections from Susan L. Cutter's thirty years of scholarship on hazards, vulnerability and environmental justice, the volume tackles issues such as nuclear and toxic hazards, risk assessment, communication and planning, and societal responses. Cutter maps out the terrain and draws out the salient themes with a fresh, powerful introduction written in the wake of her work in the aftermath of Katrina. This essential collection is ideal for professionals, researchers, academics and students working on hazards, risk, disasters and environmental justice across a range of disciplines.},

   abstract = {The southern United States is no stranger to hazard and disaster events. Intense hurricanes, drought, flooding, and other climate-sensitive hazards are commonplace and have outnumbered similar events in other areas of the United States annually in both scale and magnitude by a ratio of almost 4:1 during the past 10 years. While losses fromclimate-sensitive hazards are forecast to increase in the coming years, not all of the populations residing within these hazard zones have the same capacity to prepare for, respond to, cope with, and rebound from disaster events. The identification of these vulnerable populations and their location relative to zones of known or probably future hazard exposure is necessary for the development and implementation of effective adaptation, mitigation, and emergency management strategies. This paper provides an approach to regional assessments of hazards vulnerability by describing and integrating hazard zone information on four climatesensitive hazards with socioeconomic and demographic data to create an index showing both the areal extent of hazard exposure and social vulnerability for the southern United States. When examined together, these maps provide an assessment of the likely spatial impacts of these climate-sensitive hazards and their variability. The identification of hotspots-counties with elevated exposures and elevated social vulnerability-highlights the distribution of the most at risk counties and the driving factors behind them. Results provide the evidentiary basis for developing targeted strategic initiatives for disaster risk reduction including preparedness for response and recovery and longer-term adaptation in those most vulnerable and highly impacted areas. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

   abstract = {An extensive body of research has demonstrated that air pollution exposure is associated with adverse health outcomes. Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O3 and PM2.5).},

   abstract = {Background: Redlining has been associated with worse health outcomes and various environmental disparities, separately, but little is known of the interaction between these two factors, if any. We aimed to estimate whether living in a historically-redlined area modifies the effects of exposures to ambient PM2.5 and extreme heat on mortality by non-external causes. Methods: We merged 8,884,733 adult mortality records from thirteen state departments of public health with scanned and georeferenced Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps from the University of Richmond, daily average PM2.5 from a sophisticated prediction model on a 1-km grid, and daily temperature and vapor pressure from the Daymet V4 1-km grid. A case-crossover approach was used to assess modification of the effects of ambient PM2.5 and extreme heat exposures by redlining and control for all fixed and slow-varying factors by design. Multiple moving averages of PM2.5 and duration-aware analyses of extreme heat were used to assess the most vulnerable time windows. Results: We found significant statistical interactions between living in a redlined area and exposures to both ambient PM2.5 and extreme heat. Individuals who lived in redlined areas had an interaction odds ratio for mortality of 1.0093 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0084, 1.0101) for each 10 µg m−3 increase in same-day ambient PM2.5 compared to individuals who did not live in redlined areas. For extreme heat, the interaction odds ratio was 1.0218 (95% CI 1.0031, 1.0408). Conclusions: Living in areas that were historically-redlined in the 1930’s increases the effects of exposures to both PM2.5 and extreme heat on mortality by non-external causes, suggesting that interventions to reduce environmental health disparities can be more effective by also considering the social context of an area and how to reduce disparities there. Further study is required to ascertain the specific pathways through which this effect modification operates and to develop interventions that can contribute to health equity for individuals living in these areas.},

Mobile home parks are a form of affordable housing prevalent in rural areas that is being lost as parks close across the United States and few new parks are developed. Limited research on how residents view their parks and the public perception that mobile home parks are undesirable may diminish efforts to prevent park closures. This paper considers how mobile home residents view their quality of life and housing issues living in this type of rural community. Findings from a survey of two hundred and fifty-six residents at nine mobile home parks in Vermont are reported. Respondents were asked how they viewed their housing, neighborhood, park management, and infrastructure. Residents were found to have lower incomes than other households in the state. Most were satisfied with life in the park, though lower income residents were significantly happier with the social atmosphere than those with higher incomes. For many households mobile home parks are not transitional housing but are rather places they have lived, and plan to live, for many years. This research can aid rural planners improve and develop future affordable housing, including the evolution of the mobile home park.

Fluctuations in heavy rainfall events can impact flooding and drought events and water management systems. This research addresses temporal and spatial distributions of extreme daily and monthly rainfall in Kansas using daily rainfall data from 23 stations for the period 1890–2013. The Mann–Kendall non-parametric method was used in trend analysis. Results indicate an increasing trend in the annual daily maximum rainfall, and an increase in the annual number of rainfall events above the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile thresholds at a majority of stations since 1890. The most recent 30-year climate normal period (1981–2010) was selected to assess contemporary change compared to the entire period (1890–2013). Most stations have a steeper positive slope for all extreme rainfall parameters for 1981–2010. Generally, western Kansas receives smaller and fewer extreme storms than eastern Kansas with respect to both magnitude and frequency. Since 1890, June has been the month that receives the greatest amount of rain in each year at a majority of stations (18 of 23). Stations in eastern Kansas tend to experience earlier maximum rainfall on a monthly basis than central and western stations. Earlier annual maximum monthly rains can affect soil moisture and runoff generation. Timely maintenance and improvement in water, soil, and flood management systems are necessary in order to increase preparedness of the society to flash floods and protect them from water management systems failures.},

There has been growing interest among exposure assessors, epidemiologists, and policymakers in the concept of "hot spots", or more broadly, the "spatial extent" of impacts from traffic-related air pollutants. This review attempts to quantitatively synthesize findings about the spatial extent under various circumstances. Methods. We include both the peer-reviewed literature and government reports, and focus on four significant air pollutants: carbon monoxide, benzene, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter (including both ultrafine particle counts and fine particle mass). From the identified studies, we extracted information about significant factors that would be hypothesized to influence the spatial extent within the study, such as the study type (e.g., monitoring, air dispersion modeling, GIS-based epidemiological studies), focus on concentrations or health risks, pollutant under study, background concentration, emission rate, and meteorological factors, as well as the study's implicit or explicit definition of spatial extent. We supplement this meta-analysis with results from some illustrative atmospheric dispersion modeling. Results. We found that pollutant characteristics and background concentrations best explained variability in previously published spatial extent estimates, with a modifying influence of local meteorology, once some extreme values based on health risk estimates were removed from the analysis. As hypothesized, inert pollutants with high background concentrations had the largest spatial extent (often demonstrating no significant gradient), and pollutants formed in near-source chemical reactions (e.g., nitrogen dioxide) had a larger spatial extent than pollutants depleted in near-source chemical reactions or removed through coagulation processes (e.g., nitrogen oxide and ultrafine particles). Our illustrative dispersion model illustrated the complex interplay of spatial extent definitions, emission rates, background concentrations, and meteorological conditions on spatial extent estimates even for non-reactive pollutants. Our findings indicate that, provided that a health risk threshold is not imposed, the spatial extent of impact for mobile sources reviewed in this study is on the order of 100-400 m for elemental carbon or particulate matter mass concentration (excluding background concentration), 200-500 m for nitrogen dioxide and 100-300 m for ultrafine particle counts. Conclusion. First, to allow for meaningful comparisons across studies, it is important to state the definition of spatial extent explicitly, including the comparison method, threshold values, and whether background concentration is included. Second, the observation that the spatial extent is generally within a few hundred meters for highway or city roads demonstrates the need for high resolution modeling near the source. Finally, our findings emphasize that policymakers should be able to develop reasonable estimates of the "zone of influence" of mobile sources, provided that they can clarify the pollutant of concern, the general site characteristics, and the underlying definition of spatial extent that they wish to utilize. © 2007 Zhou and Levy; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Wildfires are a significant threat to human health, in part through degraded air quality. Prescribed burning can reduce wildfire severity but can also lead to an increase in air pollution. The complexities of fires and atmospheric processes lead to uncertainties when predicting the air quality impacts of fire and make it difficult to fully assess the costs and benefits of an expansion of prescribed fire. By modeling differences in emissions, surface conditions, and meteorology between wildfire and prescribed burns, we present a novel comparison of the air quality impacts of these fire types under specific scenarios. One wildfire and two prescribed burn scenarios were considered, with one prescribed burn scenario optimized for potential smoke exposure. We found that PM2.5 emissions were reduced by 52%, from 0.27 to 0.14 Tg, when fires burned under prescribed burn conditions, considerably reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Excess short-term mortality from PM2.5 exposure was 40 deaths for fires under wildfire conditions and 39 and 15 deaths for fires under the default and optimized prescribed burn scenarios, respectively. Our findings suggest prescribed burns, particularly when planned during conditions that minimize smoke exposure, could be a net benefit for the impacts of wildfires on air quality and health.},

   abstract = {Heat waves and air pollution episodes pose a serious threat to human health and may worsen under future climate change. In this paper, we use 15 years (1999-2013) of commensurately gridded (1° × 1°) surface observations of extended summer (April-September) surface ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and maximum temperature (TX) over the eastern United States and Canada to construct a climatology of the coincidence, overlap, and lag in space and time of their extremes. Extremes of each quantity are defined climatologically at each grid cell as the 50 d with the highest values in three 5-y windows (∼95th percentile). Any two extremes occur on the same day in the same grid cell more than 50% of the time in the northeastern United States, but on a domain average, co-occurrence is approximately 30%. Although not exactly co-occurring, many of these extremes show connectedness with consistent offsets in space and in time, which often defy traditional mechanistic explanations. All three extremes occur primarily in large-scale, multiday, spatially connected episodes with scales of >1,000 km and clearly coincide with large-scale meteorological features. The largest, longest-lived episodes have the highest incidence of co-occurrence and contain extreme values well above their local 95th percentile threshold, by +7 ppb for O3, +6 μg m-3 for PM2.5, and +1.7 °C for TX. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate these extremes as synergistic costressors to accurately quantify their impacts on human health.},

   abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them. © 2012 The Authors.

The PM data analysis showed clear diurnal, weekly and seasonal cycles at the study site. In diurnal cycle, highest PM concentrations were observed during weekday's peak hour traffic and lowest PM concentrations were found during trickle traffic (afternoon and nighttime). The seasonal PM data analysis showed highest concentrations during post monsoon season (PM10 = 189, PM2.5 = 84, PM1 = 66 μg/m3) compared to winter (PM10 = 135, PM2.5 = 73, PM1 = 59 μg/m3) and summer (PM10 = 102, PM2.5 = 50, PM1 = 34 μg/m3) seasons. The particle size distribution during post-monsoon, winter and summer seasons showed two distinct modes viz. accumulation (mean diameter, d = 2.2 μm; distribution = 40%) and coarse (d = 7.1 μm, distribution = 60%). The frequency distribution of PM10 concentrations during post-monsoon and winter seasons indicated that the PM10 values at the study site fall under moderate to poor categories. During post-monsoon and winter seasons, it was found that more than 50% of the time the 24-h average PM10 concentrations were violating the Indian national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) (100 μg/m3) and world health organization (WHO) standard (50 μg/m3).

However, cyclists and pedestrians may be exposed to high concentrations of air pollutants due to their proximity to vehicle emissions. Commercial face mask respirators are widely used, in both developing and developed countries, as an individual protective measure against particle pollution. However scientific data on the efficacy of face mask respirators in reducing airborne particle exposure is limited. In this study, a custom experimental set-up was developed in order to measure the effectiveness of nine different respirators under real environmental conditions in terms of particle mass concentration below 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particle number concentration (PNC), Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA) and Black Carbon concentration (BC). Face mask performances were assessed in a typical traffic affected urban background environment in the city of Barcelona under three different simulated breathing rates to investigate the influence of flow rate. Results showed a median face mask effectiveness for PM2.5 equal to 48% in a range of 14–96%, 19% in a range of 6%–61% for BC concentration, 19% in a range of 4%–63% for PNC and 22% in a range of 5%–65% for LDSA. For each pollutant under investigation, the best performance was found always with the same mask (N7) although it is not the most expensive (in a range of price of 1 to 44, its cost was 20 euros), which has a filter on the entire surface except for the 2 exhalation valves where air cannot enter but just exit and shows a good fit on the dummy head.},

The Reducing Air Pollution in Detroit Intervention Study (RAPIDS) was designed to evaluate cardiovascular health benefits and personal PM2.5 exposure reductions via indoor portable air filtration systems among senior citizens in Detroit, Michigan. We evaluated the utility of two commercially available high-efficiency (HE: true-HEPA) and low-efficiency (LE: HEPA-type) indoor air filtration to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations and personal PM2.5 exposures for 40 participants in a double-blinded randomized crossover intervention. Each participant was subjected to three intervention scenarios: HE, LE, or no filter (control) of three consecutive days each, during which personal, indoor, and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were measured daily. For mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations, we observed 60 and 52% reductions using HE and LE filters, respectively, relative to no filtration. Personal PM2.5 exposures were reduced by 53 and 31% using HE and LE filters, respectively, when compared with the control scenario.

The absolute vertical accuracy of GDEM v3 was calculated by comparison with more than 23,000 independent reference geodetic ground control points from the U.S. National Geodetic Survey. The root mean square error (RMSE) measured for GDEM v3 is 8.52 meters. This compares with the RMSE of 8.68 meters for GDEM v2. Another important descriptor of vertical accuracy is the mean error, or bias, which indicates if a DEM has an overall vertical offset from true ground level. The GDEM v3 mean error of &minus;1.20 meters reflects an overall negative bias in GDEM v3. The absolute vertical accuracy assessment results, both mean error and RMSE, were segmented by land cover type to provide insight into how GDEM v3 performs in various land surface conditions. While the RMSE varies little across cover types (6.92 to 9.25 meters), the mean error (bias) does appear to be affected by land cover type, ranging from &minus;2.99 to +4.16 meters across 14 land cover classes. These results indicate that in areas where built or natural aboveground features are present, GDEM v3 is measuring elevations above the ground level, a condition noted in assessments of previous GDEM versions (v1 and v2) and an expected condition given the type of stereo-optical image data collected by ASTER. GDEM v3 was also evaluated by differencing with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset. In many forested areas, GDEM v3 has elevations that are higher in the canopy than SRTM. The overall validation effort also included an evaluation of the GDEM v3 water mask. In general, the number of distinct water polygons in GDEM v3 is much lower than the number in a reference land cover dataset, but the total areas compare much more closely.</p>},

   abstract = {Rapid growing urban population has resulted in the occupancy of large proportionate of the city and its outskirts, thereby contributing factors to change in the environmental conditions. This has resulted in widespread land acquisition for built up and industrial development, covering the centre of the city while moving at the outskirts of the city as well. Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) changes causes alterations in the land use categories, mostly the concrete forests which has increased the urban temperature as compared to the rural regions due to rapidly growing urbanized environment. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the human-induced environmental phenomenon affecting the urban inhabitant in many ways, such as altering and disturbing the land cover its use which changes thermal energy flow causing elevated surface and air temperature. Temporal satellite datasets (LANDSAT ETM+ image of 1989, 2000 and 2006) can be used to monitor surface temperature while vegetation indices can be used to assess the coverage of the vegetation and non-vegetation area in the region. Temporal NDVI is employed in the study area to analyse the impact of land surface temperature against NDVI in the region. Therefore, temporal remotely sensed data can be used to map LULC and its dynamic changes and other environmental phenomena such as surface temperature over a period of time. Temporal UHI has been estimated using geospatial technology to incorporate it for environmental impact assessment on the surrounding environment. The present research focuses on temporal NDVI and Surface temperature, the methodology used altogether for the assessment of resolution dynamic UHI change on environmental condition for Haridwar district, Uttrakhand India and Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh in India. Both case study has different environmental conditions, geographical locations and demography. Hilly and forested region with almost no industrial activities for Haridwar while several industrial activities and densely populated region Kanpur located in an Indo-Gangetic plain. The research outcome demonstrates the correlation between temporal NDVI and Surface temperature exemplified with case study conducted over two different regions, geographically as well as economically. There is a need to consider the environmental dimension while making progress to urbanization.},

Summer- and winter-only data available at 99 locations in the subsequent 3 years, up to November 2012, were analyzed to examine variation of LUR results across years. Spatial variation of each element was modeled in LUR including six major emission indicators: boilers burning residual oil; traffic density; industrial structures; construction/demolition (these four indicators in buffers of 50 to 1000 m), commercial cooking based on a dispersion model; and ship traffic based on inverse distance to navigation path weighted by associated port berth volume. All the elements except sodium were associated with at least one source, with R2 ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Strong source-element associations, persistent across years, were found for residual oil burning (nickel, zinc), near-road traffic (copper, iron, and titanium), and ship traffic (vanadium). These emission source indicators were also significant and consistent predictors of PM2.5 concentrations across years.},

   abstract = {The urban thermal environment varies not only from its rural surroundings but also within the urban area due to intra-urban differences in land-use and surface characteristics. Understanding the causes of this intra-urban variability is a first step in improving urban planning and development. Toward this end, a method for quantifying causes of spatial variability in the urban heat island has been developed. This paper presents the method as applied to a specific test case of Portland, Oregon. Vehicle temperature traverses were used to determine spatial differences in summertime ∼2 m air temperature across the metropolitan area in the afternoon. A tree-structured regression model was used to quantify the land-use and surface characteristics that have the greatest influence on daytime UHI intensity. The most important urban characteristic separating warmer from cooler regions of the Portland metropolitan area was canopy cover. Roadway area density was also an important determinant of local UHI magnitudes. Specifically, the air above major arterial roads was found to be warmer on weekdays than weekends, possibly due to increased anthropogenic activity from the vehicle sector on weekdays. In general, warmer regions of the city were associated with industrial and commercial land-use. The downtown core, whilst warmer than the rural surroundings, was not the warmest part of the Portland metropolitan area. This is thought to be due in large part to local shading effects in the urban canyons. © Springer-Verlag 2008.},

   abstract = {A generalized approach for estimating season-specific diurnal profiles of anthropogenic heating for cities is presented. Each profile consists of heat released from three components: building sector, transportation sector, and metabolism. In turn, the building sector is divided into heat released from electricity consumption and heat released from heating fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil. Each component is developed separately based on a population density formulation. The profiles are based on commonly available data resources that are mapped onto the diurnal cycle using seasonal profile functions. Representative winter and summer weekday profiles are developed and presented for six large US cities. The diurnal profiles have morning and evening peaks, with summertime maxima up to 60Wm-2. Anthropogenic heating in winter is generally larger, with maxima up to 75Wm-2. While these analyses were carried out at the city-scale the paper discusses how the same data sources could be applied at scales down to the individual census tract (or traffic analysis zone), resulting in high spatial resolution profiles and larger maxima corresponding to higher population densities in the urban core. Based on our analysis of San Francisco we find that the urban core region may have a daytime population density that is 5-10 times that of the city-scale value. Hence, the corresponding anthropogenic heating values in the urban core will be 5-10 times the magnitudes of the city-scale values presented in this paper. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Understanding the thermal behaviour of different urban surface parameters (USPs) at large spatial scales is essential for strategic heat mitigation. This study evaluates USPs from several perspectives to assess their comparative effectiveness as heat mitigation strategies. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) is used to simulate the urban climate of Melbourne for summer 2019 – Australia's warmest year. Fifty-two simulations are tested to represent changes in USPs as in vegetation type, built-cover ratio, building height, green roofs and cool roofs. The results of each simulation are compared with the baseline in terms of heat indices. Roofs with high albedos are found to be the best heat mitigation for reducing daytime temperatures (0.85 albedo; −1.29 °C) while green roofs show the best nighttime efficacy (100 %, −1.15 °C). Vegetation ratio, green and cool roofs show near-linear negative relationships with heat. Cooling is found to be more effective with trees when distributed in both canyon and urban parks than only planted in street canyon. These findings underscore the significance of USP characteristics in heat mitigation that can inform strategic urban planning with spatial arrangements of green infrastructure.},

The implementation of urban blue and green infrastructures can help regulate urban temperatures. However, quantitative estimations of the combined effects of urban blue infrastructures and neighbouring green spaces on air temperature (T) and humidity (RH) are still unclear. In this study, the effect of the spatiotemporal pattern of urban lakes and neighbouring green spaces on daytime T and RH within a 500 m radius, and their seasonal variations, were investigated using a land-use regression (LUR) approach. LUR models containing ten lakes and adjacent green spaces (LG) were successfully developed to calculate annual and seasonal air T and RH averages. Correlation analysis revealed that locations with large lakes that are more complex in shape, supported by large neighbouring green spaces characterised by greater aggregation and lower patch density, affect daytime T-RH most in all seasons. The significantly positive effect of lakes and neighbouring greenery on air T-RH extended up to 300 m in spring, summer and autumn, and up to 200 m in winter. Moreover, the effects of the extent, intensity and efficiency of lakes and greenery on air T-RH could be influenced by season and time intervals. The effect intensity in T of 0.3–1.0 °C occurred within a radius of 200–300 m with an efficiency of 1.5–3.3 °C/km between seasons, and the effect intensity in RH of 1.4–4.0% occurred within a radius of 200–300 m with an efficiency of 6.0–13.3%/km between seasons.},

There is a knowledge gap in the literature: there is no previous study which differentiates between national-scale inequalities -i.e. inequalities apparent in all location of a country, and the local-scale inequalities -i.e. inequalities existing in some areas of a country. Employing a semi-parametric geographically weighted regression model to study LST in Dutch residential zones in the summer of 2014, the results of this study show that two national-scale inequalities are significant: overexposure of high-income groups and underexposure of the owners of high-value properties. Additionally, eight local-scale inequalities are identified. Among the latter, ethnic inequalities, overexposure of Non-western and Western immigrants, found to be the most severe and frequent at the local scale. Additionally, females are often the second most overexposed to LST at the local-scale. To a lesser degree Rental dwellings and Population age 15−24 are the second most overexposed of a zone's population. In the end, the results and policy implications are discussed.},

Land use regulations may permit, prohibit, or impose special conditions on housing near major roadways. This paper answers two questions: First, how is residential development near major roadways regulated? Second, how common are zoning changes near major roadways, and what factors explain these changes? This paper compares the zoning designations of near-roadway parcels with others in the city, and uses two sets of logistic regression models to analyze near-roadway zoning. The results show that residential development is permitted on most near-roadway parcels, including more than 92% of those within 500 feet of a freeway. One of the main explanations is that Los Angeles's hierarchical zoning structure allows housing development in most commercial zones. While many of these parcels have commercial development today, they could be redeveloped for residential uses in the future. Larger shares of near-roadway parcels were upzoned to allow higher residential densities compared with parcels elsewhere in the city, but this difference is explained by other locational factors.},

To do so, a simple urban scheme was incorporated into the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS). Subsequently, a simulation was performed with the coupled model over the wider area of Paris, for a 12-day period in June 2006 that was characterised by conditions prone to UHI development. Simulated 2-m air temperature was compared with observed values for urban and rural stations, yielding mean errors of 1.4 and 1.5 K, respectively. More importantly, it was found that the model also displayed an overall good capability of reproducing the observed temperature differences. In particular, the magnitude (up to 6 K) and timing of the diurnal cycle of the UHI intensity was simulated well, the model exhibiting a mean error of 1.15 K. As a result, our conclusion is that the ARPS model, extended with simple urban surface physics, is able to capture observed urban-rural air temperature differences well, at least for the domain and period studied. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Multivariate indices of segregation and sustainability are created using data aggregated to 933 US Census Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The relationship between segregation and sustainability (and dimensions, independently) is analyzed across the CBSAs using correlation and spatial analyses. Results show an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability, where increasing urban segregation corresponds to decreases in sustainability. Social and economic dimensions of sustainability are negatively correlated with segregation while the environmental dimension is positively correlated. Spatial analysis reveals regional associations between the measures with most of the lower sustainability scores and higher segregation scores occuring mainly in the South. The findings demonstrate an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability as well as between the environmental and social dimensions. These correlations indicate a need to consider inequalities, and the social dimension of sustainability more broadly, when planning urban revitalization efforts. Spatial scale is also imperative to understanding and improving the social outcomes for all members of the community.},

Characteristics of residents like races are often associated with differing levels of vulnerability to climate disasters. Developing adaptation strategies that provide just and equal protection to diverse population groups has become an urgent concern. Here, we examine the spatial and quantitative distribution of 3,466 adaptation actions reported over the past five years among 983 U.S. urban counties with different racial groups and socioeconomic statuses. Our findings reveal significant and growing disparities in climate adaptation among U.S. urban counties with overrepresented White, Black and Asian residents. We also find that the local level of disaster exposure plays an unignorable role in deriving racial disparities in adaptation actions. Disaster exposure, characterized by expected annual loss, has a stronger impact on adaptation policymaking in urban counties with high proportions of Asian or Black residents, compared to those with high proportions of White residents. With limited adaptation resources, focusing heavily on areas with high exposure to disaster damages might hinder adaptation actions to protect vulnerable individuals, households and communities and thus exacerbates racial disparities in climate adaptation and causes adaptation failure of racially minority groups. Our study provides novel empirical evidence for researchers and decision-makers on the evaluation of justice in climate adaptation. The co-present disparities between climate disaster exposure and adaptation actions can serve as an indicator of the societal need for adaptation actions to be equally developed and implemented.},

Since UHI and UPI can interact with each other, these two issues should be studied concurrently for a better urban environment. This study investigated the interaction between the UHI and UPI in Berlin, through a combined analysis of in-situ and remote sensing observations of aerosols and meteorological variables in June, July, and August from 2010 to 2017. The atmospheric UHI (AUHI), surface UHI (SUHI), atmospheric UPI (AUPI), and near-surface UPI (NSUPI) were analyzed. The SUHI and AUPI are represented by the remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), and the AUHI and NSUPI are represented by the in-situ air temperature and Particulate Matter (PM10) concentrations. The study area shows spatial consistency between SUHI and AUPI, with higher LST and AOD in the urban areas. UHI strengthens the turbulent dispersion of particles in the urban areas, decreasing the NSUPI. The NSUPI intensity shows a negative relationship with the AUHI intensity, especially at night with a correlation coefficient of −0.31. The increased aerosols in urban atmosphere reduce the incoming solar radiation and increase the atmospheric longwave radiation in the urban areas. The response of the surface to the change of absorbed radiation is strong at night and weak during the day. This study estimates that the SUHI intensity is enhanced by around 12% at clear night by the increased absorbed radiation in the urban areas using an attribution method. The goal of this paper is to strengthen the understanding of the interactive influence between UHI and UPI and provide a basis for designing mitigation strategies of UHI and UPI.},

   abstract = {Background: Missing data are common in statistical analyses, and imputation methods based on random forests (RF) are becoming popular for handling missing data especially in biomedical research. Unlike standard imputation approaches, RF-based imputation methods do not assume normality or require specification of parametric models. However, it is still inconclusive how they perform for non-normally distributed data or when there are non-linear relationships or interactions. Methods: To examine the effects of these three factors, a variety of datasets were simulated with outcome-dependent missing at random (MAR) covariates, and the performances of the RF-based imputation methods missForest and CALIBERrfimpute were evaluated in comparison with predictive mean matching (PMM). Results: Both missForest and CALIBERrfimpute have high predictive accuracy but missForest can produce severely biased regression coefficient estimates and downward biased confidence interval coverages, especially for highly skewed variables in nonlinear models. CALIBERrfimpute typically outperforms missForest when estimating regression coefficients, although its biases are still substantial and can be worse than PMM for logistic regression relationships with interaction. Conclusions: RF-based imputation, in particular missForest, should not be indiscriminately recommended as a panacea for imputing missing data, especially when data are highly skewed and/or outcome-dependent MAR. A correct analysis requires a careful critique of the missing data mechanism and the inter-relationships between the variables in the data.},

   abstract = {Heatwaves are becoming more frequent under climate change and can lead to thousands of excess deaths. Adaptation to extreme weather events often occurs in response to an event, with communities learning fast following unexpectedly impactful events. Using extreme value statistics, here we show where regional temperature records are statistically likely to be exceeded, and therefore communities might be more at-risk. In 31% of regions examined, the observed daily maximum temperature record is exceptional. Climate models suggest that similar behaviour can occur in any region. In some regions, such as Afghanistan and parts of Central America, this is a particular problem - not only have they the potential for far more extreme heatwaves than experienced, but their population is growing and increasingly exposed because of limited healthcare and energy resources. We urge policy makers in vulnerable regions to consider if heat action plans are sufficient for what might come. The global risk of record-breaking heatwaves is assessed, with the most at-risk regions identified. It is shown that record-smashing events that currently appear implausible could happen anywhere as a result of climate change.},

   abstract = {Background: Heat-waves present severe dangers to populations' health. Due to climate change, an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat-waves is to be expected. Public health measures to prevent negative health effects have been developed in several member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region over the past decade. Methods: This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of the development of heat preparedness planning in WHO European Region member states, using a unique methodology based on criteria developed and pre-tested by the WHO. This indicator-based approach is based on eight core elements that are crucial components of heat-health action plans. Results: Of 53 member states of the WHO European Region, 51 countries were included in the evaluation. Results show that 18 countries have developed heat-health action plans, whereas 33 others have not. The plans developed so far vary in the degree of comprehensiveness with regard to the core elements. Gaps in terms of plan coverage have predominantly been identified in the areas of (intersectorial) long-term measures, surveillance and plan evaluation. Conclusions: For better preparedness, it can be advocated for further improving, developing and implementing heat-wave preparedness planning and response in European countries. A focus should be placed on developing all elements and strong intersectorial coordination and cooperation as well as the successful implementation of surveillance and evaluation measures. © 2013 World Health Organisation.},

Objectives: To investigate the interaction between heat and ambient air pollution on daily mortality in a large dataset of 620 cities from 36 countries. Methods: We used daily data on all-cause mortality, air temperature, particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), PM ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from 620 cities in 36 countries in the period 1995–2020. We restricted the analysis to the six consecutive warmest months in each city. City-specific data were analysed with over-dispersed Poisson regression models, followed by a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. The joint association between air temperature and air pollutants was modelled with product terms between non-linear functions for air temperature and linear functions for air pollutants. Results: We analyzed 22,630,598 deaths. An increase in mean temperature from the 75th to the 99th percentile of city-specific distributions was associated with an average 8.9 % (95 % confidence interval: 7.1 %, 10.7 %) mortality increment, ranging between 5.3 % (3.8 %, 6.9 %) and 12.8 % (8.7 %, 17.0 %), when daily PM10 was equal to 10 or 90 μg/m3, respectively. Corresponding estimates when daily O3 concentrations were 40 or 160 μg/m3 were 2.9 % (1.1 %, 4.7 %) and 12.5 % (6.9 %, 18.5 %), respectively. Similarly, a 10 μg/m3 increment in PM10 was associated with a 0.54 % (0.10 %, 0.98 %) and 1.21 % (0.69 %, 1.72 %) increase in mortality when daily air temperature was set to the 1st and 99th city-specific percentiles, respectively. Corresponding mortality estimate for O3 across these temperature percentiles were 0.00 % (-0.44 %, 0.44 %) and 0.53 % (0.38 %, 0.68 %). Similar effect modification results, although slightly weaker, were found for PM2.5 and NO2. Conclusions: Suggestive evidence of effect modification between air temperature and air pollutants on mortality during the warm period was found in a global dataset of 620 cities.},

Vulnerability patterns, and corresponding adaptation strategies, are most usefully conceptualized at a local level. Methods: We used a case-only analysis to examine subject and neighborhood characteristics that modified the association between heat waves and mortality. All deaths of New York City residents from 2000 through 2011 were included in this analysis. Meteorological data were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. Modifying characteristics were obtained from the death record and geographic data sets. results: A total of 234,042 adult deaths occurred during the warm season of our study period. Compared with other warm-season days, deaths during heat waves were more likely to occur in black (non-Hispanic) individuals than other race/ethnicities [odds ratio (OR) = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.12], more likely to occur at home than in institutions and hospital settings (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.16), and more likely among those living in census tracts that received greater public assistance (OR = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09). Finally, deaths during heat waves were more likely among residents in areas of the city with higher relative daytime summer surface temperature and less likely among residents living in areas with more green space. conclusion: Mortality during heat waves varies widely within a city.

Nevertheless, the existing literature on indoor exposure to heat often regards AC as a binary variable and assumes that its presence inevitably results in a safe thermal environment. This is also reflected in heat vulnerability assessments that assign a binary attribute to AC. In this study, we used thermal simulation of buildings to investigate overheating in residential buildings in three US cities (Houston, Phoenix, and Los Angeles) and focused on scenarios where an AC system is present; yet not fully functional. Moreover, we identified the role of key building characteristics and investigated the sensitivity of indoor environment to the ambient temperature. Our results show that energy poverty and/or faulty systems can expose a considerable fraction of AC-owning elderly in Phoenix and Houston to excess heat for more than 50% of summer. This highlights the need to reevaluate AC as the primary protective factor against heat and introduces several implications that need to be considered in heat vulnerability assessments.},

A comprehensive, semistructured survey was conducted by telephone at 901 households in Houston in 2011. Frequency and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results show that 20% of the survey respondents reported heat-related symptoms in the summer of 2011 despite widespread air conditioning availability throughout Houston. Of those reporting heat-related symptoms experienced in the home (n 5 56), the majority could not afford to use air conditioning because of the high cost of electricity.

   abstract = {Despite all theoretically and empirically motivated criticism of GDP as a social welfare and progress indicator, its role in economics, public policy, politics and society continues to be influential. To resolve this paradox, one has to recognize that many economists accept the criticism of the GDP indicator but deny its relevance. This paper evaluates the reasons for denial. This entails five steps: (1) a brief review is offered of the extensive literature showing that GDP per capita (growth) is far from a robust indicator of social welfare (progress); (2) the influence of GDP information on economic decisions by firms, consumers, investors and governments is examined; (3) behavioural explanations for a widespread belief in the relevance of GDP are discussed; (4) the customary arguments in favour of the GDP indicator are analysed; and (5) proposed alternatives to GDP are evaluated. The paper ends with outlining the implications of giving less attention to GDP information in policy and politics. It is argued that removal of the information failure which GDP represents, in monitoring economic progress and guiding public policy, will lead to decisions and developments being more in line with improving human well-being. Moreover, ignoring GDP information is consistent with a perfectly neutral stance regarding economic (GDP) growth. Indeed, an unconditional anti- or pro-growth imperative acts as an unnecessary constraint on our search for human progress. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Climate variability and change are issues of growing public health importance. Numerous studies have documented risks of extreme heat on human health in different locations around the world. Strategies to prevent heat-related morbidity and reduce disparities are possible but require improved knowledge of health outcomes during hot days at a small-scale level as important within-city variability in local weather conditions, socio-demographic composition, and access to air conditioning (AC) may exist. We analyzed hospitalization data for three unique climate regions of San Diego County alongside temperature data spanning 14 years to quantify the health impact of ambient air temperature at varying exceedance threshold levels. Within San Diego, coastal residents were more sensitive to heat than inland residents. At the coast, we detected a health impact at lower temperatures compared to inland locations for multiple disease categories including heat illness, dehydration, acute renal failure, and respiratory disease. Within the milder coastal region where access to AC is not prevalent, heat-related morbidity was higher in the subset of zip codes where AC saturation is lowest. We detected a 14.6% increase (95% confidence interval [4.5%, 24.6%]) in hospitalizations during hot weather in comparison to colder days in coastal locations where AC is less common, while no significant impact was observed in areas with higher AC saturation. Disparities in AC ownership were associated with income, race/ethnicity, and homeownership. Given that heat waves are expected to increase with climate change, understanding health impacts of heat and the role of acclimation is critical for improving outcomes in the future.},

   abstract = {Climate variability and change are issues of growing public health importance. Numerous studies have documented risks of extreme heat on human health in different locations around the world. Strategies to prevent heat-related morbidity and reduce disparities are possible but require improved knowledge of health outcomes during hot days at a small-scale level as important within-city variability in local weather conditions, socio-demographic composition, and access to air conditioning (AC) may exist. We analyzed hospitalization data for three unique climate regions of San Diego County alongside temperature data spanning 14 years to quantify the health impact of ambient air temperature at varying exceedance threshold levels. Within San Diego, coastal residents were more sensitive to heat than inland residents. At the coast, we detected a health impact at lower temperatures compared to inland locations for multiple disease categories including heat illness, dehydration, acute renal failure, and respiratory disease. Within the milder coastal region where access to AC is not prevalent, heat-related morbidity was higher in the subset of zip codes where AC saturation is lowest. We detected a 14.6% increase (95% confidence interval [4.5%, 24.6%]) in hospitalizations during hot weather in comparison to colder days in coastal locations where AC is less common, while no significant impact was observed in areas with higher AC saturation. Disparities in AC ownership were associated with income, race/ethnicity, and homeownership. Given that heat waves are expected to increase with climate change, understanding health impacts of heat and the role of acclimation is critical for improving outcomes in the future.},

   abstract = {The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in a heightened state of precarity, as studies observe that vulnerable communities—especially those within urban areas in the United States—are disproportionately exposed to extreme heat. Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between “redlining”, or the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as 7 °C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in redlined areas are approximately 2.6 °C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat events.},

   abstract = {The relationship between urbanization and economic growth has been perplexing. In this paper, we identify the pattern of global change and the correlation of urbanization and economic growth, using cross-sectional, panel estimation and geographic information systems (GIS) methods. The analysis has been carried out on a global geographical scale, while the timescale of the study spans the last 30 years. The data shows that urbanization levels have changed substantially during these three decades. Empirical findings from cross-sectional data and panel data support the general notion of close links between urbanization levels and GDP per capita. However, we also present significant evidence that there is no correlation between urbanization speed and economic growth rate at the global level. Hence, we conclude that a given country cannot obtain the expected economic benefits from accelerated urbanization, especially if it takes the form of government-led urbanization. In addition, only when all facets are taken into consideration can we fully assess the urbanization process.},

   abstract = {There is an extensive literature on the urbanization process looking at both urbanization and urban concentration, asking whether and when there is under or over-urbanization or under or over urban concentration. Writers argue that national government policies and non-democratic institutions promote excessive concentration - the extent to which the urban population of a country is concentrated in one or two major metropolitan areas - except in former planned economies where migration restrictions are enforced. These literatures assume that there is an optimal level of urbanization or an optimal level of urban concentration, but no research to date has quantitatively examined the assumption and asked the basic "so-what" question - how great are the economic losses from significant deviations from any optimal degrees of urban concentration or rates of urbanization? This paper shows that (1) there is a best degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing productivity growth (2) that best degree varies with the level of development and country size, and (3) over or under-concentration can be very costly in terms of productivity growth. The paper shows also that productivity growth is not strongly affected by urbanization per se. Rapid urbanization has often occurred in the face of low or negative economic growth over some decades. Moreover, urbanization is a transitory phenomenon where many countries are now fully urbanized. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

Urban areas offer economies of scale and richer market structures, and there is strong evidence that workers in urban areas are individually more productive, and earn more, than rural workers. However, rapid urbanization is also associated with crowding, environmental degradation, and other impediments to productivity. Overall, we find no evidence that the level of urbanization affects the rate of economic growth.

   abstract = {Adjustments in the final use of energy are a critical margin of adaptation for maintaining indoor thermal comfort. This paper explores how households have been adopting air conditioning and thermal insulation to cope with different climatic conditions, and how climatic factors interact with socio-economic, demographic, and household characteristics across eight OECD countries. Changes in the cumulative number of hot and cold days over the year, urbanization, demographics and household characteristics, including attitudes towards energy efficiency, strongly affect those two margins of adaptation, along with income. If the historically-observed adaptation behaviour is maintained also under future socio-economic pathways and climate scenarios, the impact of global warming and income on air conditioning adoption will be reinforced by urbanization trends, which on the contrary will make it more difficult to improve building thermal insulation.},

@article{Di2019,
   abstract = {Various approaches have been proposed to model PM2.5 in the recent decade, with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth, land-use variables, chemical transport model predictions, and several meteorological variables as major predictor variables. Our study used an ensemble model that integrated multiple machine learning algorithms and predictor variables to estimate daily PM2.5 at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km across the contiguous United States. We used a generalized additive model that accounted for geographic difference to combine PM2.5 estimates from neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The three machine learning algorithms were based on multiple predictor variables, including satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, elevation, chemical transport model predictions, several reanalysis datasets, and others. The model training results from 2000 to 2015 indicated good model performance with a 10-fold cross-validated R2 of 0.86 for daily PM2.5 predictions. For annual PM2.5 estimates, the cross-validated R2 was 0.89. Our model demonstrated good performance up to 60 μg/m3. Using trained PM2.5 model and predictor variables, we predicted daily PM2.5 from 2000 to 2015 at every 1 km × 1 km grid cell in the contiguous United States. We also used localized land-use variables within 1 km × 1 km grids to downscale PM2.5 predictions to 100 m × 100 m grid cells. To characterize uncertainty, we used meteorological variables, land-use variables, and elevation to model the monthly standard deviation of the difference between daily monitored and predicted PM2.5 for every 1 km × 1 km grid cell. This PM2.5 prediction dataset, including the downscaled and uncertainty predictions, allows epidemiologists to accurately estimate the adverse health effect of PM2.5. Compared with model performance of individual base learners, an ensemble model would achieve a better overall estimation. It is worth exploring other ensemble model formats to synthesize estimations from different models or from different groups to improve overall performance.},

   abstract = {Big Data is one of the major challenges of statistical science and has numerous consequences from algorithmic and theoretical viewpoints. Big Data always involve massive data but they also often include online data and data heterogeneity. Recently some statistical methods have been adapted to process Big Data, like linear regression models, clustering methods and bootstrapping schemes. Based on decision trees combined with aggregation and bootstrap ideas, random forests were introduced by Breiman in 2001. They are a powerful nonparametric statistical method allowing to consider in a single and versatile framework regression problems, as well as two-class and multi-class classification problems. Focusing on classification problems, this paper proposes a selective review of available proposals that deal with scaling random forests to Big Data problems. These proposals rely on parallel environments or on online adaptations of random forests. We also describe how out-of-bag error is addressed in these methods. Then, we formulate various remarks for random forests in the Big Data context. Finally, we experiment five variants on two massive datasets (15 and 120 millions of observations), a simulated one as well as real world data. One variant relies on subsampling while three others are related to parallel implementations of random forests and involve either various adaptations of bootstrap to Big Data or “divide-and-conquer” approaches. The fifth variant is related to online learning of random forests. These numerical experiments lead to highlight the relative performance of the different variants, as well as some of their limitations.},
