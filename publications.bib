   abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of potentially hazardous heat conditions across the United States, putting the incarcerated population of 2 million at risk for heat-related health conditions. We evaluate the exposure to potentially hazardous heat for 4,078 continental US carceral facilities during 1982–2020. Results show that the number of hot days per year increased during 1982–2020 for 1,739 carceral facilities, primarily located in the southern United States. State-run carceral facilities in Texas and Florida accounted for 52% of total exposure, despite holding 12% of all incarcerated people. This highlights the urgency for enhanced infrastructure, health system interventions and treatment of incarcerated people, especially under climate change.},

   abstract = {Understanding changes in the built environment is vital for sustainable urban development and disaster preparedness. Recent years have seen the emergence of a variety of global, continent-level, and nation-wide datasets related to the current state and the evolution of the built environment, human settlements or building stocks.&nbsp;However, such datasets may&nbsp;face limitations like incomplete coverage, sparse building information, coarse resolution, and limited timeframes. This study addresses these challenges by integrating three spatial datasets to create an extensive, attribute-rich sequence of settlement layers spanning 200 years for the contiguous U.S. This integration process involves complex data processing, merging property-level real estate, parcel, and remote sensing-based building footprint data, and creating gridded multi-temporal settlement layers. This effort unveils the latest edition (Version 2)&nbsp;of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US), which includes the latest land use and structural information as of the year 2021. It enables detailed research on urban form and structure, helps assess and map the built environment’s risk to natural hazards, assists in population modeling, supports land use analysis, and aids health studies.},

   abstract = {Post-hurricane damage assessments are often costly and time-consuming. Remotely sensed data provides a complementary method of data collection that can be completed comparatively quickly and at relatively low cost. This study focuses on 15 Florida counties impacted by Hurricane Michael (2018), which had category 5 strength winds at landfall. The present study evaluates the ability of aerial imagery collected to cost-effectively measure blue tarps on buildings for disaster impact and recovery. A support vector machine model classified blue tarp, and parcels received a damage indicator based on the model's prediction. The model had an overall accuracy of 85.3% with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 96.7%. The model results indicated approximately 7% of all parcels (27 926 residential and 4431 commercial parcels) in the study area as having blue tarp present. The study results may benefit jurisdictions that lacked financial resources to conduct on-the-ground damage assessments.},

   abstract = {In recent years, extreme heat amplified the need for indoor cooling systems. Some local governments started to provide household cooling systems for vulnerable people. However, the lack of local AC prevalence makes equitable AC dissemination more difficult. Therefore, this study developed neighborhood-level AC prevalence information for California (CA), US Properties were on the market from 2018 to 2021 with a unique real estate dataset from Zillow Transaction and Assessment Dataset (ZTRAX). The analysis selected housing attributes with theoretical or empirical linkages to AC access. Data preprocessing imputed missing values with a random forest (RF) analysis. Next, a subsequent multi-class RF estimated the types of household AC ownership (central, other, yes, and none). The RF model showed an overall accuracy of 98% (class-specific accuracies for Central: 98%, None: 96%, Other: 95%, Yes: 99%). Jackknifing revealed the latitude, longitude, heating type or system, elevation, built year, cooling degree days, and building quality exhibited the highest Gini importance values. This study visualized AC prevalence in CA and four counties with major cities: Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, and San Francisco County. This result can be applied to implementing heat prevention measures such as providing household cooling systems, energy subsidies, cooling centers, and increased green space access.},
