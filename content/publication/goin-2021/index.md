abstract: Restricting to live births can induce bias in studies of pregnancy and developmental
  outcomes, but whether this live-birth bias results in underestimating disparities
  is unknown. Bias may arise from collider stratification due to an unmeasured common
  cause of fetal loss and the outcome of interest, or depletion of susceptibles, where
  exposure differentially causes fetal loss among those with underlying susceptibility.
  Methods We conducted a simulation study to examine the magnitude of live-birth bias
  in a population parameterized to resemble one year of conceptions in California
  (N = 625,000). We simulated exposure to a non-time-varying environmental hazard,
  risk of spontaneous abortion, and time to live birth using 1000 Monte Carlo simulations.
  Our outcome of interest was preterm birth. We included a social vulnerability factor
  to represent social disadvantage, and estimated overall risk differences for exposure
  and preterm birth using linear probability models and stratified by the social vulnerability
  factor. We calculated how often confidence intervals included the true point estimate
  (CI coverage probabilities) to illustrate whether effect estimates differed qualitatively
  from the truth. Results Depletion of susceptibles resulted in a larger magnitude
  of bias compared with collider stratification, with larger bias among the socially
  vulnerable group. Coverage probabilities were not adversely affected by bias due
  to collider stratification. Depletion of susceptibles reduced coverage, especially
  among the socially vulnerable (coverage among socially vulnerable = 46%, coverage
  among nonsocially vulnerable = 91% in the most extreme scenario). Conclusions In
  simulations, hazardous environmental exposures induced live-birth bias and the bias
  was larger for socially vulnerable women.
