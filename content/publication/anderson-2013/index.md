abstract: 'Introduction: It has been recognised that as outdoor ambient temperatures
  increase past a particular threshold, so do mortality/morbidity rates. However,
  similar thresholds for indoor temperatures have not yet been identified. Due to
  a warming climate, the non-sustainability of air conditioning as a solution, and
  the desire for more energy-efficient airtight homes, thresholds for indoor temperature
  should be defined as a public health issue.'
