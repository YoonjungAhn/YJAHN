 abstract = {Chained current element (CCE) analysis is a new approach of magnetic source analysis for the spinal cord evoked field (SCEF) measurements. In the CCE analysis, magnetic sources are described by multiple dipoles arranged along a parameterized curve that corresponds to a modelled spinal cord. Both path of the neural signal propagation and the current distribution along the path are determined at once by searching the parameters that determine the shape and position of the curve. We applied the CCE analysis to the data from an actual SCEF measurement on a rabbit. The possibility of the lesion localization of the spinal cord by the CCE analysis was indicated.
