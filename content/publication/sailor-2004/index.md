abstract: 'A generalized approach for estimating season-specific diurnal profiles
  of anthropogenic heating for cities is presented. Each profile consists of heat
  released from three components: building sector, transportation sector, and metabolism.
  In turn, the building sector is divided into heat released from electricity consumption
  and heat released from heating fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil. Each component
  is developed separately based on a population density formulation. The profiles
  are based on commonly available data resources that are mapped onto the diurnal
  cycle using seasonal profile functions. Representative winter and summer weekday
  profiles are developed and presented for six large US cities. The diurnal profiles
  have morning and evening peaks, with summertime maxima up to 60Wm-2. Anthropogenic
  heating in winter is generally larger, with maxima up to 75Wm-2. While these analyses
  were carried out at the city-scale the paper discusses how the same data sources
  could be applied at scales down to the individual census tract (or traffic analysis
  zone), resulting in high spatial resolution profiles and larger maxima corresponding
  to higher population densities in the urban core. Based on our analysis of San Francisco
  we find that the urban core region may have a daytime population density that is
  5-10 times that of the city-scale value. Hence, the corresponding anthropogenic
  heating values in the urban core will be 5-10 times the magnitudes of the city-scale
  values presented in this paper. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'
