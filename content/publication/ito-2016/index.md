abstract: 'Few past studies have collected and analyzed within-city variation of fine
  particulate matter (PM2.5) elements. We developed land-use regression (LUR) models
  to characterize spatial variation of 15 PM2.5 elements collected at 150 street-level
  locations in New York City during December 2008-November 2009: aluminum, bromine,
  calcium, copper, iron, potassium, manganese, sodium, nickel, lead, sulfur, silicon,
  titanium, vanadium, and zinc. Summer- and winter-only data available at 99 locations
  in the subsequent 3 years, up to November 2012, were analyzed to examine variation
  of LUR results across years. Spatial variation of each element was modeled in LUR
  including six major emission indicators: boilers burning residual oil; traffic density;
  industrial structures; construction/demolition (these four indicators in buffers
  of 50 to 1000 m), commercial cooking based on a dispersion model; and ship traffic
  based on inverse distance to navigation path weighted by associated port berth volume.
  All the elements except sodium were associated with at least one source, with R2
  ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Strong source-element associations, persistent across years,
  were found for residual oil burning (nickel, zinc), near-road traffic (copper, iron,
  and titanium), and ship traffic (vanadium). These emission source indicators were
  also significant and consistent predictors of PM2.5 concentrations across years.'
