abstract: 'BACKGROUND Heat illness (HI) is a growing global concern; its incidence
  has risen dramatically across the world in recent years. The individual factors
  whereby elevated core temperature produces HI are not well-understood. Given known
  physiological differences between men and women pertaining to temperature regulation,
  we hypothesized that women would be at increased risk of HI than men.   OBJECTIVES
  We aimed to determine the relative risk of HI in women compared with men through
  an exhaustive literature review and meta-analysis.   METHODS We search PubMed and
  Ovid Medline databases from inception to Apr 2017. Search terms included all permutations
  of sex and heat illness (including heatstroke and exertional heat illness) with
  no language restrictions. We included adult or adolescent human data reporting comparable
  male and female HI rates. One reviewer identified and screened titles and abstracts.
  Two independent reviewers applied eligibility criteria. Disagreements were resolved
  with a third reviewer.   RESULTS Of 5888 articles identified by searches, 36 were
  included in the systematic review and 22 in the meta-analysis. The mean (standard
  deviation) quality score was 3.31(1.25)/5. Overall the rate among women was consistently
  lower than men across the lifespan. The male: female pooled IRR was 2.28 (p < 0.001,
  95% CI: 1.66–3.16). There was modest heterogeneity (between-studies variance (τ2)
  = 0.02). The rates did not differ significantly when corrected for severity or occupation.   DISCUSSION
  The rate of HI was significantly increased in men compared with women. Risk for
  HI might be conferred by psychological and behavioral factors rather than physiological
  ones. Further research is required to delineate which groups are at greatest risk,
  leading to the development of mitigation strategies against HI.   OTHER No funding
  was received. The authors acknowledge the support of the UK Women in Ground Close
  Combat Review. The Study was registered with PROSPREO CRD42017064739'
