abstract: Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of a novel, real-time sensor network
  for routine monitoring of racial and economic disparities in fine particulate matter
  (PM2.5; particulate matter ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) exposures at the neighborhood level.
  Methods. We deployed a dense network of low-cost PM2.5 sensors in Chicago, Illinois,
  to evaluate associations between neighborhood-level composition variables (percentage
  of Black residents, percentage of Hispanic/Latinx residents, and percentage of households
  below poverty) and interpolated PM2.5. Relationships were assessed in spatial lag
  models after adjustment for all composition variables. Models were fit with data
  both from the overall period and during high-pollution episodes associated with
  social events (July 4, 2021) and wildfires (July 23, 2021). Results. The spatial
  lag models showed that racial/ethnic composition variables were associated with
  higher PM2.5 levels. Levels were notably higher in neighborhoods with larger compositions
  of Hispanic/ Latinx residents across the entire study period and notably higher
  in neighborhoods with larger Black populations during the July 4 episode. Conclusions.
  As a complement to sparse regulatory networks, dense, low-cost sensor networks can
  capture spatial variations during short-term air pollution episodes and enable monitoring
  of neighborhood-level inequities in air pollution exposures in real time.
