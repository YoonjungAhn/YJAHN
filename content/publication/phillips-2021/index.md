abstract: 'Efforts to understand the complex, multidimensional nature of environmental
  vulnerability can generate new knowledge by deploying a convergence research framework
  within a community-engaged approach. We explore the benefits and shortcomings of
  what we call engaged convergence research (ECR) by narrating a case study that uncovered
  a pattern of indoor heat-related deaths that was previously unexplained: Although
  only 5 percent of Maricopa County, Arizona, residents live in mobile homes, residents
  of mobile homes account for 29 percent of indoor heat-related deaths. Exploring
  the multiplicative threats of economic precarity, population sensitivity to environmental
  exposure, site, and shelter type, we recharacterize the reality faced by mobile
  home dwellers to find them falling between the cracks of available heat resilience
  options. Beyond contributing to scholarship on indoor heat-related deaths, we demonstrate
  the potential for novel and actionable insights emerging from ECR. We also elucidate
  some of the challenges faced when enlisting community actors as coproducers of knowledge
  in geographic research.'
