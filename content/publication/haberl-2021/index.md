abstract: 'The dynamics of societal material stocks such as buildings and infrastructures
  and their spatial patterns drive surging resource use and emissions. Two main types
  of data are currently used to map stocks, night-Time lights (NTL) from Earth-observing
  (EO) satellites and cadastral information. We present an alternative approach for
  broad-scale material stock mapping based on freely available highresolution EO imagery
  and OpenStreetMap data. Maps of built-up surface area, building height, and building
  types were derived from optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 satellite data to
  map patterns of material stocks for Austria and Germany. Using material intensity
  factors, we calculated the mass of different types of buildings and infrastructures,
  distinguishing eight types of materials, at 10 m spatial resolution. The total mass
  of buildings and infrastructures in 2018 amounted to 5 Gt in Austria and 38 Gt in
  Germany (AT: 540 t/cap, DE: 450 t/cap). Cross-checks with independent data sources
  at various scales suggested that the method may yield more complete results than
  other data sources but could not rule out possible overestimations. The method yields
  thematic differentiations not possible with NTL, avoids the use of costly cadastral
  data, and is suitable for mapping larger areas and tracing trends over time.'
