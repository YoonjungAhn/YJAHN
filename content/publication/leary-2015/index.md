abstract: 'Background: Using current climate models, regional-scale changes for Florida
  over the next 100 years are predicted to include warming over terrestrial areas
  and very likely increases in the number of high temperature extremes. No uniform
  definition of a heat wave exists. Most past research on heat waves has focused on
  evaluating the aftermath of known heat waves, with minimal consideration of missing
  exposure information. Objectives: To identify and discuss methods of handling and
  imputing missing weather data and how those methods can affect identified periods
  of extreme heat in Florida. Methods: In addition to ignoring missing data, temporal,
  spatial, and spatio-temporal models are described and utilized to impute missing
  historical weather data from 1973 to 2012 from 43 Florida weather monitors. Calculated
  thresholds are used to define periods of extreme heat across Florida. Results: Modeling
  of missing data and imputing missing values can affect the identified periods of
  extreme heat, through the missing data itself or through the computed thresholds.
  The differences observed are related to the amount of missingness during June, July,
  and August, the warmest months of the warm season (April through September). Conclusions:
  Missing data considerations are important when defining periods of extreme heat.
  Spatiotemporal methods are recommended for data imputation. A heat wave definition
  that incorporates information from all monitors is advised.'
