abstract: Architectural design based on bioclimatic features has long been of interest
  to many designers. Exploiting climate indicators and the use of passive strategies
  are among the central principles of this design approach. The main purpose of the
  present study is to provide bioclimatic design strategies to enhance the human thermal
  comfort in the humid climate zones based on Cfa KÃ¶ppen climate classification. This
  study focused on to improve indoor thermal comfort with climate indicators. The
  eight cities studied include Rasht (Iran), Durban (South Africa), Tokyo (Japan),
  Kutaisi (Georgia), Houston (United States), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Brisbane (Queensland)
  and Trieste (Italy) according to similarities in the climatic zones and the most
  important criteria climates such as humidity and rainfall were selected all around
  the world. Hereafter, the city of Rasht was directly investigated as a case study.
  In this way at first, the climatic data of Rasht collected. Then it analyzed concerning
  the Givoni Bioclimatic Chart and Mahoney Table to determine the appropriate bioclimatic
  design strategies. In the following, these strategies plotted from the Givoni chart
  and the Mahoney table and the design recommendations provided as diagrams related
  to the strategies and debated separately. In the end, the executive function of
  the strategies regarding the relations between the zones of Givoni bioclimatic chart
  and months of the year, and also the strategies have discussed the indicators of
  the Mahoney table as well. The extensive findings described in this paper allowed
  us to conclude that certain bioclimatic design strategies that have been adopted
  in specific cities and countries could be exported to other zones with similar climates
  because they were proven to be useful functional architectural design strategies
  that resulted to improve human indoor thermal comfort.
