abstract: The scientific literature through 2005 on the effects of ventilation rates
  on health in indoor environments has been reviewed by a multidisciplinary group.
  The group judged 27 papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals as providing
  sufficient information on both ventilation rates and health effects to inform the
  relationship. Consistency was found across multiple investigations and different
  epidemiologic designs for different populations. Multiple health endpoints show
  similar relationships with ventilation rate. There is biological plausibility for
  an association of health outcomes with ventilation rates, although the literature
  does not provide clear evidence on particular agent(s) for the effects. Higher ventilation
  rates in offices, up to about 25l/s per person, are associated with reduced prevalence
  of sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms. The limited available data suggest that
  inflammation, respiratory infections, asthma symptoms and short-term sick leave
  increase with lower ventilation rates. Home ventilation rates above 0.5 air changes
  per hour (h-1) have been associated with a reduced risk of allergic manifestations
  among children in a Nordic climate. The need remains for more studies of the relationship
  between ventilation rates and health, especially in diverse climates, in locations
  with polluted outdoor air and in buildings other than offices. Â© 2011 John Wiley
