abstract: The aim of this research is to test Artificial Neural Network (ANN) package
  in GRASS 6.4 software for spatial interpolation and to compare it with common interpolation
  techniques IDW and ordinary kriging. This package was also compared with neural
  networks packages nnet and neuralnet available in software R Project. The entire
  packages uses multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model trained with the back propagation
  algorithm. Evaluation methods were based mainly on RMSE. All the tests were done
  on artificial data created in R Project software; which simulated three surfaces
  with different characteristics. In order to find the best configuration for the
  multilayer perceptron many different settings of network were tested (test-and-trial
  method). The number of neurons in hidden layers was the main tested parameter. Results
  indicate that MLP model in the ANN module implemented in GRASS can be used for spatial
  interpolation purposes. However the resulting RMSE was higher than RMSE from IDW
  and ordinary kriging method and time consuming. When compared neural network packages
  in GRASS GIS and R Project; it is better to use the packages in R Project. Training
  of MLP was faster in this case and results were the same or slightly better.
