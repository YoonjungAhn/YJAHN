abstract: Seasonal patterns of birth outcomes have been observed worldwide, and there
  was increasing evidence that ambient temperature played as a trigger of adverse
  birth outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and stillbirth.
  To systematically review updated epidemiological evidence about the relationship
  between temperature exposure during pregnancy and PTB, LBW, and stillbirth, we searched
  for related studies published in English from electronic databases and references
  of identified papers. We only included original articles that directly reported
  the effects of prenatal temperature exposure on birth outcomes. The characteristics
  and main findings of included studies were examined. A total of 36 epidemiological
  studies were finally included in this review. Most of these studies focused on PTB
  and LBW, while less attention has been paid to stillbirth that was relatively rare
  in the occurrence. Several designs including ecological (e.g., descriptive and time-series)
  and retrospective cohort studies (e.g., case-crossover and time-to-event) were applied
  to assess temperature effects on birth outcomes. Temperature metrics and exposure
  windows varied greatly in these investigations. Exposure to high temperature was
  generally found to be associated with PTB, LBW, and stillbirth, while several studies
  also reported the adverse impact of low temperature on birth outcomes of PTB and
  LBW. Despite no conclusive causality demonstrated, the current evidence for adverse
  effect on birth outcomes was stronger for heat than for cold. In summary, the evidence
  linking birth outcomes with ambient temperature was still very limited. Consequently,
  more related studies are needed worldwide and should be conducted in diversified
  climate zones, so as to further ascertain the association between temperature and
  birth outcomes. Future studies should focus on more sophisticated study designs,
  more accurate estimation of temperature exposure during pregnancy, and more efficient
  methods to find out the exposure windows, as well as cold-related effects on birth
  outcomes.
