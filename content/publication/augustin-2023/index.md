abstract: Numerous studies and models address the determinants of health. However,
  in existing models, the spatial aspects of the determinants are not or only marginally
  taken into account and a theoretical discussion of the association between space
  and the determinants of health is missing. The aim of this paper is to generate
  a framework that can be used to place the determinants of health in a spatial context.
  A screening of the current literature first serves to identify the relevant determinants
  and describes the current state of knowledge. In addition, spatial scales that are
  important for the spatial consideration of health were developed and discussed.
  Based on these two steps, the conceptual framework on the spatial determinants of
  health was derived and subsequently discussed. The results show a variety of determinants
  that are associated with health from a spatial point of view. The overarching categories
  are global driving forces, policy and governance, living and physical environment,
  socio-demographic and economic conditions, healthcare services and cultural and
  working conditions. Three spatial scales (macro, meso and micro) are further subdivided
  into six levels, such as global (e.g., continents), regional (e.g., council areas)
  or neighbourhood (e.g., communities). The combination of the determinants and spatial
  scales are presented within a conceptual framework as a result of this work. Operating
  mechanisms and pathways between the spatial levels were added schematically. This
  is the first conceptual framework that links the determinants of health with the
  spatial perspective. It can form the working basis for future analyses in which
  spatial aspects of health are taken into account.
