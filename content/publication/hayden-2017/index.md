abstract: Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related mortality in the United
  States, suggesting the necessity for better understanding population vulnerability
  to extreme heat. The work presented here is part of a larger study examining vulnerability
  to extreme heat in current and future climates [System for Integrated Modeling of
  Metropolitan Extreme Heat Risk (SIMMER)] and was undertaken to assess Houston, Texas,
  residents' adaptive capacity to extreme heat. A comprehensive, semistructured survey
  was conducted by telephone at 901 households in Houston in 2011. Frequency and logistic
  regression analyses were conducted. Results show that 20% of the survey respondents
  reported heat-related symptoms in the summer of 2011 despite widespread air conditioning
  availability throughout Houston. Of those reporting heat-related symptoms experienced
  in the home (n 5 56), the majority could not afford to use air conditioning because
  of the high cost of electricity. This research highlights the efficacy of community-based
  surveys to better understand adaptive capacity at the household level; this survey
  contextualizes population vulnerability and identifies more targeted intervention
  strategies and adaptation actions.
