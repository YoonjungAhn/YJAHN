abstract: Exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a leading risk factor
  for mortality. We develop global estimates of annual PM2.5 concentrations and trends
  for 1998-2018 using advances in satellite observations, chemical transport modeling,
  and ground-based monitoring. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) from advanced satellite
  products including finer resolution, increased global coverage, and improved long-term
  stability are combined and related to surface PM2.5 concentrations using geophysical
  relationships between surface PM2.5 and AOD simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical
  transport model with updated algorithms. The resultant annual mean geophysical PM2.5
  estimates are highly consistent with globally distributed ground monitors (R2 =
  0.81; slope = 0.90). Geographically weighted regression is applied to the geophysical
  PM2.5 estimates to predict and account for the residual bias with PM2.5 monitors,
  yielding even higher cross validated agreement (R2 = 0.90-0.92; slope = 0.90-0.97)
  with ground monitors and improved agreement compared to all earlier global estimates.
  The consistent long-term satellite AOD and simulation enable trend assessment over
  a 21 year period, identifying significant trends for eastern North America (-0.28
  ± 0.03 μg/m3/yr), Europe (-0.15 ± 0.03 μg/m3/yr), India (1.13 ± 0.15 μg/m3/yr),
  and globally (0.04 ± 0.02 μg/m3/yr). The positive trend (2.44 ± 0.44 μg/m3/yr) for
  India over 2005-2013 and the negative trend (-3.37 ± 0.38 μg/m3/yr) for China over
  2011-2018 are remarkable, with implications for the health of billions of people.
