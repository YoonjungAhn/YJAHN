abstract: While there is a recognised need to adapt to changing climatic conditions,
  there is an emerging discourse of limits to such adaptation. Limits are traditionally
  analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological, economic or technological
  parameters. This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society
  and hence contingent on ethics, knowledge, attitudes to risk and culture. We review
  insights from history, sociology and psychology of risk, economics and political
  science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation. First, any
  limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse
  values. Second, adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight
  of risk. Third, social and individual factors limit adaptation action. Fourth, systematic
  undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real, experienced but subjective
  limits to adaptation. We conclude that these issues of values and ethics, risk,
  knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation, but that these limits
  are mutable. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.
