abstract: The potential consequences of occupational heat stress in a changing climate
  on workers, workplaces, and global economies are substantial. Occupational heat
  stress risk is projected to become particularly high in middle-and low-income tropical
  and subtropical regions, where optimal controls may not be readily available. This
  commentary presents occupational heat stress in the context of climate change, reviews
  its impacts, and reflects on implications for heat stress assessment and control.
  Future efforts should address limitations of existing heat stress assessment methods
  and generate economical, practical, and universal approaches that can incorporate
  data of varying levels of detail, depending on resources. Validation of these methods
  should be performed in a wider variety of environments, and data should be collected
  and analyzed centrally for both local and large-scale hazard assessments and to
  guide heat stress adaptation planning. Heat stress standards should take into account
  variability in worker acclimatization, other vulnerabilities, and workplace resources.
  The effectiveness of controls that are feasible and acceptable should be evaluated.
  Exposure scientists are needed, in collaboration with experts in other areas, to
  effectively prevent and control occupational heat stress in a changing climate.
  r e-con te x t uA li zin g o ccupAtion A l He At str e ss Heat stress in occupational
  populations is a moving target. Global climate change, which includes both changes
  in mean weather conditions and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events
  (IPCC, 2013), will change the pattern of occupational heat stress risks over time.
  Workers in tropical and subtropical regions, many of whom are involved in heavy
  physical work outdoors or indoors without effective cooling, are at particularly
  high risk (Kjellstrom et al., 2013). Unacclimatized workers in temperate regions
  are also at increased risk of heat stress, especially during heat waves (Adam-Poupart
  et al., 2013). Workers in large cities may experience greater heat exposures, relative
  to their rural counterparts, as a result of urban heat island effects (United States
  Environmental Protection Agency, 2014). A complex picture emerges when work is viewed
  in the context of climate change. Heat stress risk will vary by industry and occupation
  over time not only as a result of spatiotemporal changes in weather conditions
