abstract: 'Governments throughout the globe usually implement early warning systems
  to prevent health-related costs from exposure to extreme heat. In a warming world,
  this type of information-provision approach is believed to be an effective way to
  deal with this natural hazard, even when there is little evidence of its influence
  on individuals’ behavior. Using detailed information from 1 million trips recorded
  by a bike-sharing system in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this paper investigates the
  direct behavioral impact of heat warnings on cycling trips. The results show substantial
  avoidance behavior for female cyclists and older users: the number of trips for
  those groups decreases following a heat warning. Alternative specifications for
  temperature and falsification tests suggest that the findings are robust. As in
  other studies, this paper also shows that the impact is diluted as time under alert
  increases.'
