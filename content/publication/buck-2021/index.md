abstract: This work is intended to assess the relationship between the three dimensions
  of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social) and residential segregation
  broadly across US urban areas. Multivariate indices of segregation and sustainability
  are created using data aggregated to 933 US Census Core-Based Statistical Areas
  (CBSAs). The relationship between segregation and sustainability (and dimensions,
  independently) is analyzed across the CBSAs using correlation and spatial analyses.
  Results show an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability, where
  increasing urban segregation corresponds to decreases in sustainability. Social
  and economic dimensions of sustainability are negatively correlated with segregation
  while the environmental dimension is positively correlated. Spatial analysis reveals
  regional associations between the measures with most of the lower sustainability
  scores and higher segregation scores occuring mainly in the South. The findings
  demonstrate an inverse relationship between segregation and sustainability as well
  as between the environmental and social dimensions. These correlations indicate
  a need to consider inequalities, and the social dimension of sustainability more
  broadly, when planning urban revitalization efforts. Spatial scale is also imperative
  to understanding and improving the social outcomes for all members of the community.
