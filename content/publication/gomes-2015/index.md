abstract: "Objectives The effect of ambient temperature as a stroke trigger is likely
  to differ by type of stroke and to depend on non-transient exposures that influence
  the risk of this outcome. We aimed to quantify the association between ambient temperature
  variation and stroke, according to clinical characteristics of the events, and other
  risk factors for stroke. Methods We conducted a case-crossover study based on a
  1-year registry of the hospital admissions due to newly occurring ischemic and hemorrhagic
  stroke events in Maputo, Mozambique's capital city (N = 593). The case-period was
  defined as the 7 days before the stroke event, which was compared to two control
  periods (14-21 days and 21-28 days before the event). We computed humidity- and
  precipitation-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using
  conditional logistic regression. Results An association between minimum temperature
  declines higher than 2.4 °C in any two consecutive days in the previous week and
  the occurrence of stroke was observed only for first events (OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.76).
  Stronger and statistically significant associations were observed for hemorrhagic
  stroke (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.07-2.09) and among subjects not exposed to risk factors,
  including smoking, high serum cholesterol or atrial fibrillation. No differences
  in the effect of temperature were found according to the patients' vital status
  28 days after the event. Conclusions First stroke events, especially of the hemorrhagic
  type, were triggered by declines in the minimum temperature between consecutive
  days of the preceding week."
