abstract: <p>The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) convened an expert panel to develop
  a set of evidence-based guidelines for the recognition, prevention, and treatment
  of heat-related illness. We present a review of the classifications, pathophysiology,
  and evidence-based guidelines for planning and preventive measures as well as best-practice
  recommendations for both field- and hospital-based therapeutic management of heat-related
  illness. These recommendations are graded based on the quality of supporting evidence
  and the balance between the benefits and risks or burdens for each modality.</p>
