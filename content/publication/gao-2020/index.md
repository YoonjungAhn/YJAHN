abstract: Urban land expansion is one of the most visible, irreversible, and rapid
  types of land cover/land use change in contemporary human history, and is a key
  driver for many environmental and societal changes across scales. Yet spatial projections
  of how much and where it may occur are often limited to short-term futures and small
  geographic areas. Here we produce a first empirically-grounded set of global, spatial
  urban land projections over the 21st century. We use a data-science approach exploiting
  15 diverse datasets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution
  remote sensing observations. We find the global total amount of urban land could
  increase by a factor of 1.8–5.9, and the per capita amount by a factor of 1.1–4.9,
  across different socioeconomic scenarios over the century. Though the fastest urban
  land expansion occurs in Africa and Asia, the developed world experiences a similarly
  large amount of new development. Here the authors develop a&nbsp;set of global,
  long-term, spatial projections of urban land expansion for understanding the planet’s
  potential urban futures. The global total amount of urban land increases by a factor
  of 1.8-5.9 over the 21st century, and the developed world experiences as much new
  urban development as the developing world.
