abstract: The extent to which societies will globally be able to adapt to climate
  change is not well understood. Here we analyze socioeconomic dimensions of adaptive
  capacity of populations to deal with heat stress and find income, urbanization and
  income inequality to be important factors in explaining adaptation to heat stress
  with air conditioning (AC). Using the scenario framework of the Shared Socioeconomic
  Pathways (SSPs), we estimate the future cooling gap, which represents the difference
  between the population exposed to heat stress and the population able to protect
  against heat stress with AC. Depending on the scenario of socioeconomic development,
  total population affected by the cooling gap may vary between 2 billion and 5 billion
  people in 2050, with the scenario-dependent range widening further towards the end
  of the century. Our analysis shows vast regional inequalities in adaptive capacity
  for one of the most universal manifestations of climate change, underscoring the
  need to account for the different potential levels of adaptive capacity in assessments
  of climate change impacts.
