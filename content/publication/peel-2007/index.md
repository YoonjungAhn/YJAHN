abstract: Although now over 100 years old, the classification of climate originally
  formulated by Wladimir Köppen and modified by his collaborators and successors,
  is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate
  courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range
  of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing
  the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate
  using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly
  precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the
  Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations
  using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension
  onto a 0.1 • ×0.1 • grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing
  with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger
  system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most
  common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5%,
  Tropical savannah). The updated world Köppen-Geiger climate map is freely available
  electronically in the Supplementary Material Section (http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/
