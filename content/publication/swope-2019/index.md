abstract: "Housing is a major pathway through which health disparities emerge and
  are sustained over time. However, no existing unified conceptual model has comprehensively
  elucidated the relationship between housing and health equity with attention to
  the full range of harmful exposures, their cumulative burden and their historical
  production. We synthesized literature from a diverse array of disciplines to explore
  the varied aspects of the relationship between housing and health and developed
  an original conceptual model highlighting these complexities. This holistic conceptual
  model of the impact of housing on health disparities illustrates how structural
  inequalities shape unequal distribution of access to health-promoting housing factors,
  which span four pillars: 1) cost (housing affordability); 2) conditions (housing
  quality); 3) consistency (residential stability); and 4) context (neighborhood opportunity).
  We further demonstrate that these four pillars can lead to cumulative burden by
  interacting with one another and with other structurally-rooted inequalities to
  produce and reify health disparities. We conclude by offering a comprehensive vision
  for healthy housing that situates housing's impact on health through a historical
  and social justice lens, which can help to better design policies and interventions
  that use housing to promote health equity."
