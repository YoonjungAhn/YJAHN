abstract: Biogeography is spatial by nature. Over the past 20years, the literature
  related to the analysis of spatially structured data has exploded, much of it focused
  on a perceived problem of spatial autocorrelation and ways to deal with it. However,
  there are a number of other issues that permeate the biogeographical and macroecological
  literature that have become entangled in the spatial autocorrelation web. In this
  piece I discuss some of the assumptions that are often made in the analysis of spatially
  structured data that can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of spatial data,
  the methods used to analyse them, and how results can be interpreted. Â© 2011 Blackwell
