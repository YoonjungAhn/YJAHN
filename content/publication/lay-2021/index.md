abstract: 'Background: Extreme heat exposure can lead to premature death. Climate
  change is expected to increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme
  heat events, resulting in many additional heat-related deaths globally, as well
  as changing the nature of extreme cold events. At the same time, vulnerability to
  extreme heat has decreased over time, probably due to a combination of physiological,
  behavioural, infrastructural, and technological adaptations. We aimed to account
  for these changes in vulnerability and avoid overstated projections for temperature-related
  mortality. We used the historical observed decrease in vulnerability to improve
  future mortality estimates. Methods: We used historical mortality and temperature
  data from 208 US cities to quantify how observed changes in vulnerability from 1973
  to 2013 affected projections of temperature-related mortality under various climate
  scenarios. We used geographically structured meta-regression to characterise the
  relationship between temperature and mortality for these urban populations over
  the specified time period. We then used the fitted relationships to project mortality
  under future climate conditions. Findings: Between Oct 26, 2018, and March 9, 2020,
  we established that differences in vulnerability to temperature were geographically
  structured. Vulnerability decreased over time in most areas. US mortalities projected
  from a 2°C increase in mean temperature decreased by more than 97% when using 2003–13
  data compared with 1973–82 data. However, these benefits declined with increasing
  temperatures, with a 6°C increase showing only an 84% decline in projected mortality
  based on 2003–13 data. Interpretation: Even after accounting for adaptation, the
  projected effects of climate change on premature mortality constitute a substantial
  public health risk. Our work suggests large increases in temperature will require
  additional mitigation to avoid excess mortality from heat events, even in areas
  with high air conditioning coverage in place. Funding: The US Environmental Protection
  Agency and Abt Associates.'
