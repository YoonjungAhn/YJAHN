abstract: Urban areas and their vertical characteristics have a manifold and far-reaching
  impact on our environment. However, openly accessible information at high spatial
  resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this
  study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights
  for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban
  contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial
  dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological
  metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building
  height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies
  in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied,
  as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that
  both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height,
  but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results.
  When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance
  was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the
  prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building
  height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern
  Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We
  emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale.
  It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software,
  which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that
  may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis
  of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.
