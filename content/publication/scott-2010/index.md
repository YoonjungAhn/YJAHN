abstract: The tourism sector is one of the largest and fastest growing global industries
  and is a significant contributor to national and local economies around the world.
  The interface between climate and tourism is multifaceted and complex, as climate
  represents both a vital resource to be exploited and an important limiting factor
  that poses risks to be managed by the tourism industry and tourists alike. All tourism
  destinations and operators are climate-sensitive to a degree and climate is a key
  influence on travel planning and the travel experience. This chapter provides a
  synopsis of the capacities and needs for climate services in the tourism sector,
  including current and emerging applications of climate services by diverse tourism
  end-users, and a discussion of key knowledge gaps, research and capacity-building
  needs and partnerships that are required to accelerate the application of climate
  information to manage risks to climate variability and facilitate successful adaptation
  to climate change. Â© 2010 Published by Elsevier.
