abstract: '<p>The impact of chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (particulate
  matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5)) on respiratory
  disease and lung cancer mortality is poorly understood. In a cohort of 18.9 million
  Medicare beneficiaries (4.2 million deaths) living across the conterminous United
  States between 2000 and 2008, we examined the association between chronic PM2.5
  exposure and cause-specific mortality. We evaluated confounding through adjustment
  for neighborhood behavioral covariates and decomposition of PM2.5 into 2 spatiotemporal
  scales. We found significantly positive associations of 12-month moving average
  PM2.5 exposures (per 10-μg/m3 increase) with respiratory, chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease, and pneumonia mortality, with risk ratios ranging from 1.10 to 1.24. We
  also found significant PM2.5-associated elevated risks for cardiovascular and lung
  cancer mortality. Risk ratios generally increased with longer moving averages; for
  example, an elevation in 60-month moving average PM2.5 exposures was linked to 1.33
  times the lung cancer mortality risk (95% confidence interval: 1.24, 1.40), as compared
  with 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.11, 1.15) for 12-month moving average exposures.
  Observed associations were robust in multivariable models, although evidence of
  unmeasured confounding remained. In this large cohort of US elderly, we provide
  important new evidence that long-term PM2.5 exposure is significantly related to
  increased mortality from respiratory disease, lung cancer, and cardiovascular disease.</p>'
