abstract: Using a statistical approach this paper focuses on an analysis of spatial
  air temperature variations and their relation to urban land use. The work is based
  on data collected during an 18-month period at 30 sites in Göteborg, Sweden. Measurements
  show intra-urban air temperature differences of up to 9 °C in the urban district,
  and the main purpose of this study is to determine if these variations are statistically
  significant. A stepwise multiple regression analysis confirmed that surface cover
  is important for governing air temperature differences in the area. Information
  on land use and surface cover was gathered from a continuously updated land use
  database, the Master Plan of Göteborg, and a separate site description analysis.
  The site description analysis includes a test of three methods using aerial or fish-eye
  photos for characterisation of surface cover in the urban district. The results
  show statistically significant temperature variations between different land use/land
  cover categories on a diurnal basis and for all weather conditions. The importance
  of the results for urban planning application is discussed.
