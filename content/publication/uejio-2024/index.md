abstract: 'Extreme heat contributes to 8,000 to 12,000 excess U.S. deaths per year.
  Partly due to increasing summer temperatures and a renewed focus on environmental
  justice, local governments started new initiatives to manage and adapt to extreme
  heat. For example, Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S., appointed Jane Gilbert as the
  world’s first Chief Heat Officer. This manuscript summarizes Miami- Dade County’s
  preliminary efforts to build local evidence, engage the community, and rapidly respond
  to extreme heat. The manuscript’s goal is to expedite the translation of existing
  tools into mainstream extreme heat, health, and equity planning. The study generated
  local evidence to identify the places and periods of time with elevated heat related
  illness using a statistical vulnerability and time series analysis, respectively.
  The places with the highest severe heat-related illness rates had hotter land surface
  temperatures and/or higher proportions of people who were outdoor workers, indigenous,
  living in poverty or mobile homes, and households with children. “Everyday” summer
  conditions instead of rare heatwaves increase the risk of a heat related death.
  The Chief Heat Officer convened workshops that engaged 298 unique community members
  on six cross-sectoral heat topics. Key recommendations included: increasing multi-sectoral
  heat monitoring and risk communication, building more affordable housing, preserving
  and expanding greenspace, and creating heat resilience hubs. The activities culminated
  in a Heat Action Plan, which was completed in less than two years from the receipt
  of project funding.'
