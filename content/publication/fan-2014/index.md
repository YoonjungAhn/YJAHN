abstract: "In the past two years, several applications of generating three-dimensional
  (3D) buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been made available, for instance,
  OSM-3D, OSM2World, OSM Building, etc. In these projects, 3D buildings are reconstructed
  using the buildings' footprints and information about their attributes, which are
  documented as tags in OSM. Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly
  on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated
  to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of
  Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated
  in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy
  by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic-Cartographic
  Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding
  correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality
  criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in
  Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about
  four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM
  building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some
  architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as
  a simplified version of those in ATKIS data. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis."
