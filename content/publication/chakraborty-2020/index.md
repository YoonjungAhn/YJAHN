abstract: "The urban heat island (UHI) effect is strongly modulated by urban-scale
  changes to the aerodynamic, thermal, and radiative properties of the Earth's land
  surfaces. Interest in this phenomenon, both from the climatological and public health
  perspectives, has led to hundreds of UHI studies, mostly conducted on a city-by-city
  basis. These studies, however, do not provide a complete picture of the UHI for
  administrative units using a consistent methodology. To address this gap, we characterize
  clear-sky surface UHI (SUHI) intensities for all urbanized areas in the United States
  using a modified Simplified Urban-Extent (SUE) approach by combining a fusion of
  remotely-sensed data products with multiple US census-defined administrative urban
  delineations. We find the highest daytime SUHI intensities during summer (1.91 ±
  0.97 °C) for 418 of the 497 urbanized areas, while the winter daytime SUHI intensity
  (0.87 ± 0.45 °C) is the lowest in 439 cases. Since urban vegetation has been frequently
  cited as an effective way to mitigate UHI, we use NDVI, a satellite-derived proxy
  for live green vegetation, and US census tract delineations to characterize how
  vegetation density modulates inter-urban, intra-urban, and inter-seasonal variability
  in SUHI intensity. In addition, we also explore how elevation and distance from
  the coast confound SUHI estimates. To further quantify the uncertainties in our
  estimates, we analyze and discuss some limitations of these satellite-derived products
  across climate zones, particularly issues with using remotely sensed radiometric
  temperature and vegetation indices as proxies for urban heat and vegetation cover.
  We demonstrate an application of this spatially explicit dataset, showing that for
  the majority of the urbanized areas, SUHI intensity is lower in census tracts with
  higher median income and higher proportion of white people. Our analysis also suggests
  that poor and non-white urban residents may suffer the possible adverse effects
  of summer SUHI without reaping the potential benefits (e.g., warmer temperatures)
  during winter, though establishing this result requires future research using more
  comprehensive heat stress metrics. This study develops new methodological advancements
  to characterize SUHI and its intra-urban variability at levels of aggregation consistent
  with sources of other socioeconomic information, which can be relevant in future
  inter-disciplinary research and as a possible screening tool for policy-making.
