abstract: 'Background: The epidemiological evidence on the interaction between heat
  and ambient air pollution on mortality is still inconsistent. Objectives: To investigate
  the interaction between heat and ambient air pollution on daily mortality in a large
  dataset of 620 cities from 36 countries. Methods: We used daily data on all-cause
  mortality, air temperature, particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), PM ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5),
  nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from 620 cities in 36 countries in the period
  1995–2020. We restricted the analysis to the six consecutive warmest months in each
  city. City-specific data were analysed with over-dispersed Poisson regression models,
  followed by a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. The joint association between
  air temperature and air pollutants was modelled with product terms between non-linear
  functions for air temperature and linear functions for air pollutants. Results:
  We analyzed 22,630,598 deaths. An increase in mean temperature from the 75th to
  the 99th percentile of city-specific distributions was associated with an average
  8.9 % (95 % confidence interval: 7.1 %, 10.7 %) mortality increment, ranging between
  5.3 % (3.8 %, 6.9 %) and 12.8 % (8.7 %, 17.0 %), when daily PM10 was equal to 10
  or 90 μg/m3, respectively. Corresponding estimates when daily O3 concentrations
  were 40 or 160 μg/m3 were 2.9 % (1.1 %, 4.7 %) and 12.5 % (6.9 %, 18.5 %), respectively.
  Similarly, a 10 μg/m3 increment in PM10 was associated with a 0.54 % (0.10 %, 0.98
  %) and 1.21 % (0.69 %, 1.72 %) increase in mortality when daily air temperature
  was set to the 1st and 99th city-specific percentiles, respectively. Corresponding
  mortality estimate for O3 across these temperature percentiles were 0.00 % (-0.44
  %, 0.44 %) and 0.53 % (0.38 %, 0.68 %). Similar effect modification results, although
  slightly weaker, were found for PM2.5 and NO2. Conclusions: Suggestive evidence
  of effect modification between air temperature and air pollutants on mortality during
  the warm period was found in a global dataset of 620 cities.'
