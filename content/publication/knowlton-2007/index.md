abstract: Objectives. We sought to project future impacts of climate change on summer
  heat-related premature deaths in the New York City metropolitan region. Methods.
  Current and future climates were simulated over the northeastern United States with
  a global-to-regional climate modeling system. Summer heat-related premature deaths
  in the 1990s and 2050s were estimated by using a range of scenarios and approaches
  to modeling acclimatization (e.g., increased use of air conditioning, gradual physiological
  adaptation). Results. Projected regional increases in heat-related premature mortality
  by the 2050s ranged from 47% to 95%, with a mean 70% increase compared with the
  1990s. Acclimatization effects reduced regional increases in summer heat-related
  premature mortality by about 25%. Local impacts varied considerably across the region,
  with urban counties showing greater numbers of deaths and smaller percentage increases
  than less-urbanized counties. Conclusions. Although considerable uncertainty exists
  in climate forecasts and future health vulnerability, the range of projections we
  developed suggests that by midcentury, acclimatization may not completely mitigate
  the effects of climate change in the New York City metropolitan region, which would
  result in an overall net increase in heat-related premature mortality. relatively
  coarse spatial scales. A global climate model applied in the United Kingdom projected
  a 250% increase in annual heat-related deaths by the 2050s across 4 greenhouse gas
  scenarios. 16 With a high-emission-change scenario in 6 temperate Australian cities,
  a 75% increase in annual heat-related mortality among people 65 years and older
  by 2050 was projected. 17 A study in Portugal projected that summer heat-related
  deaths in Lisbon may increase by up to 6 times by the 2050s. 18 A regional impacts
  study of Califor-nia concluded that by the latter decades of the 21st century, summer
  heat-related mortality could be 2 to 7 times greater than it is now, even after
  taking possible heat acclimatization (e.g., increased use of air conditioning, gradual
  physiological adaptation) into account. 19 General circulation models are global
  scale models that take into account the dynamics of physical processes in the atmosphere
  and oceans but at relatively coarse resolution. Hence, one cannot realistically
  use these models to address the need for locally relevant projections of the potential
  effects of global warming on public health. One approach to address this limitation
  is dynamical downscal-ing, in which the general circulation model outputs are used
  as initial and boundary conditions for finer-scale simulations by regional climate
  models. We used such a system, developed by the New York Climate and Health Project,
  20 to project daily mean temperatures at local scales for the 2050s and to evaluate
  potential impacts of climate change on summer heat-related mortality in the New
  York City metropolitan region.
