abstract: <h2>Abstract</h2><p>Heat stress profoundly and unanimously reduces orthostatic
  tolerance. This review aims to provide an overview of the numerous and multifactorial
  mechanisms by which this occurs in humans. Potential causal factors include changes
  in arterial and venous vascular resistance and blood distribution, and the modulation
  of cardiac output, all of which contribute to the inability to maintain cerebral
  perfusion during heat and orthostatic stress. A number of countermeasures have been
  established to improve orthostatic tolerance during heat stress, which alleviate
  heat stress induced central hypovolemia (e.g., volume expansion) and/or increase
  peripheral vascular resistance (e.g., skin cooling). Unfortunately, these countermeasures
  can often be cumbersome to use with populations prone to syncopal episodes. Identifying
  the mechanisms of inter-individual differences in orthostatic intolerance during
  heat stress has proven elusive, but could provide greater insights into the development
  of novel and personalized countermeasures for maintaining or improving orthostatic
  tolerance during heat stress. This development will be especially impactful in occuational
  settings and clinical situations that present with orthostatic intolerance and/or
  central hypovolemia. Such investigations should be considered of vital importance
  given the impending increased incidence of heat events, and associated cardiovascular
  challenges that are predicted to occur with the ensuing changes in climate.</p>
