abstract: I argue that the impact of context on organizational behavior is not sufficiently
  recognized or appreciated by researchers. I define context as situational opportunities
  and constraints that affect the occurrence and meaning of organizational behavior
  as well as functional relationships between variables, and I propose two levels
  of analysis for thinking about context?one grounded in journalistic practice and
  the other in classic social psychology. Several means of contextualizing research
  are considered.
