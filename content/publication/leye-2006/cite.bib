 abstract = {I argue that the impact of context on organizational behavior is not sufficiently recognized or appreciated by researchers. I define context as situational opportunities and constraints that affect the occurrence and meaning of organizational behavior as well as functional relationships between variables, and I propose two levels of analysis for thinking about context?one grounded in journalistic practice and the other in classic social psychology. Several means of contextualizing research are considered.},
