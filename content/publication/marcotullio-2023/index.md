abstract: Electrical power outages are of increasing interest to US urban scholars,
  government officials and stakeholders, as they have increased in number and duration
  with significant health and economic, among other, impacts. This analysis examines
  reports of power outages in New York City in relation to socioeconomic and health
  characteristics of neighborhoods. Using the city's 311-call database we examine
  complaint calls for power outages from 2014 to 2022. While 311-calls for power outages
  occur all year long, volume trended higher during the warmer months (June, July
  and August), and as minimum daily temperatures exceeded 20 °C (68°F), the number
  of calls increased dramatically. Spatial clusters of high call areas were in Census
  tracts with high energy burdens, lower-income households, and high percentages of
  people of color. Furthermore, we found the higher call areas were associated with
  higher vulnerability to heat-exacerbated deaths. As climate change is expected to
  raise temperatures and increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves around
  the world, and as power outages are becoming more common, these findings will help
  to provide guidance for adaptation and energy reliability policies in New York City
  and have implications for other cities globally.
