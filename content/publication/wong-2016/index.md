abstract: In the post-1996 welfare reform period in the U.S., disability assistance
  has become a significant source of government aid for low-income residents as other
  forms of public support have faced considerable reductions and restrictions. In
  order to qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) - a means-tested assistance
  program that provides income stipends to qualified residents - working-age individuals
  with disabilities must have little income and resources, and procure medical documentation
  that confirms that they are unable to work due to a disability. The result of rising
  SSI enrollment in the face of cutbacks to other government programs is the increasing
  medicalization of welfare, whereby receipt of welfare benefits is contingent on
  a medical diagnosis of disability. Using county-level data from the American Community
  Survey and the Social Security Administration, this paper examines the changing
  spatial patterns of SSI participation of the working-age population in 2000 and
  2010 across the U.S. in addition to the interconnections between disability, welfare,
  and poverty. Results from spatial analyses illustrate geographic variation in SSI
  prevalence, with distinctive spatial clusters of higher than average SSI participation
  in the southeast and Appalachian regions of the U.S. and in northern California.
  Multiple linear regression model results reveal that SSI participation is significantly
  correlated with disability, poverty, race, family type, and level of education in
  both 2000 and 2010. The findings suggest that spatial concentrations of disability,
  poverty, and underemployment persist in largely rural areas. The discussion explores
  the potential social and economic implications of long-term SSI clustering on localities
  and residents, and points to future research directions.
