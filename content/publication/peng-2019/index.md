abstract: <p>Solar radiation incident at the Earth’s surface is an essential driver
  of the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface and is also an important
  input variable in the research on the surface eco-hydrological process. The reanalysis
  solar radiation dataset is characterized by a long time series and wide spatial
  coverage and is used in the research of large-scale eco-hydrological processes.
  Due to certain errors in their production process of the reanalysis of solar radiation
  products, reanalysis products should be evaluated before application. In this study,
  three global solar-radiation reanalysis products (ERA-Interim; JRA-55; and NCEP-DOE)
  in different temporal scales and climate zones were evaluated using surface solar-radiation
  observations from the National Meteorological Information Center of the China Meteorological
  Administration (CMA, Beijing, China) and the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA,
  Zürich, Switzerland) from 2000 to 2009. All reanalysis products (ERA-Interim; JRA-55;
  and NCEP-DOE) overestimated with an annual bias of 14.86 W/m2, 22.61 W/m2, and 31.85
  W/m2; monthly bias of 15.17 W/m2, 21.29 W/m2, and 36.91 W/m2; and seasonal bias
  of 15.08 W/m2, 21.21 W/m2, and 36.69 W/m2, respectively. In different Köppen climate
  zones, the annual solar radiation of ERA-Interim performed best in cold regions
  with a bias of 10.30 W/m2 and absolute relative error (ARE) of 8.98%. However, JRA-55
  and NCEP-DOE showed the best performance in tropical regions with a bias of 20.08
  W/m2 and −0.12 W/m2, and ARE of 11.00% and 9.68%, respectively. Overall, through
  the evaluations across different temporal and spatial scales, the rank of the three
  reanalysis products in order was the ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and NCEP-DOE. In addition,
  based on the evaluation, we analyzed the relationship between the error (ARE) of
  the reanalysis products and cloud cover, aerosol, and water vapor, which significantly
  influences solar radiation and we found that cloud was the main cause for errors
  in the three solar radiation reanalysis products. The above can provide a reference
  for the application and downscaling of the three solar radiation reanalysis products.</p>
