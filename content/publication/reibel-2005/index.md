abstract: Data processing for the spatial analysis of small-area social, demographic,
  and economic data often requires the combination of data spatially aggregated to
  two or more incompatible zone systems in a region, such as a set of enumeration
  districts that changes over time. Such situations can be addressed by areal interpolation-the
  transfer of data between zonal systems according to spatial algorithms. The authors
  test a technique of areal interpolation using geographic information systems (GIS)
  that employs a digital map layer representing streets and roads to derive varying
  density weights for small areas within aggregation zones. The technique reduces
  errors in estimation compared with estimates derived using the commonly applied
  area-weighting technique, with its assumption of uniform density. The street-weighting
  technique is much easier to use than other interpolation techniques that have also
  been shown to reduce error compared with area-based weighting.
