abstract: Temporal analysis of small-area demographic data commonly relies on areal
  interpolation methods to create temporally consistent and compatible areal units.
  In this study, cadastral (parcel) data are used to identify residential land and
  to dasymetrically refine census tracts, with the goal of achieving more accurate
  small-area estimates. The built date recorded for residential parcel units is used
  to create residential land layers for two different time points used in the areal
  interpolation. Three different areal interpolation methods are employed with and
  without dasymetric refinement, including areal weighting (AW), target density weighting
  (TDW) and pycnophylactic modeling (PM). The methods interpolate tract-level population
  counts in Hennepin County, Minnesota, in 2000 into census tract boundaries from
  the year 2010. The mean absolute error, median absolute error, root mean square
  error and the 90th percentile of absolute error are calculated for each of the methods,
  and spatial variation in the interpolations are displayed in maps. Parcel-based
  refinements are also compared with refinements using the National Land Cover Dataset
  (NLCD).Results show that spatial refinement using residential parcels has the potential
  to improve the accuracy of areal interpolation for temporal analysis. Parcel-refined
  TDW out-performs the other tested methods, as well as the NLCD-refined TDW in this
  example. Parcel data identify residential land more reliably in rural areas. However,
  parcel units can have very large extents potentially biasing residential area delineation
  and population counts. Parcel-based refinement has the potential to further advance
  demographic change analysis over long time periods and large areas where the built
  date attribute is included in the dataset.
