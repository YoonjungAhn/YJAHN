abstract: 'Citizens in urban areas are exposed to multiple environmental stressors
  like noise, heat, and air pollution, with impact on human health. There is a great
  deal of evidence that connects human health, objective environmental exposure, and
  place of residence. However, little is known about subjective and objective multiple
  personal exposures while being mobile. To address this research gap, this paper
  presents results from a mixed-methods exploratory study with cyclists in the City
  of Leipzig, Germany. In the summer of 2017, cyclists (n = 66) wore a unique combination
  of sensors that measured particle number counts (PNC), noise, humidity, temperature,
  geolocation, and the subjective perception of each exposure on everyday routes for
  one week (n = 730). A smartphone application was developed to question participants
  about their perception of subjective exposure. The data were analyzed with three
  aims: (i) to compare the multiple exposure profiles of the cyclists, (ii) to contrast
  the objective data and subjective individual perception, and (iii) to examine the
  role of route decision-making and awareness of health impacts for healthier route
  choices. The results indicate distinct differences between the exposure profiles
  of cyclists. Over 80% of the cyclists underestimated their exposure to noise and
  air pollution. Except for heat, no significant associations between the objective
  and subjective data were found. This reveals an exposure awareness gap that needs
  to be considered in urban health planning and risk communication. It is argued that
  knowledge about health impacts and route characteristics plays a crucial role in
  decision-making about route choices. The paper concludes with suggestions to harness
  smart sensing for exposure mitigation and research in health geography.'
