abstract: Recent observed changes in Earth's climate, to which humans have contributed
  substantially, are affecting various health outcomes. These include altered distributions
  of some infectious disease vectors (ticks at high latitudes, malaria mosquitoes
  at high altitudes), and an uptrend in extreme weather events and associated deaths,
  injuries and other health outcomes. Future climate change, if unchecked, will have
  increasing, mostly adverse, health impacts - both direct and indirect. Climate change
  will amplify health problems in vulnerable regions, influence infectious disease
  emergence, affect food yields and nutrition, increase risks of climate-related disasters
  and impair mental health. The health sector should assist society understand the
  risks to health and the needed responses. Â© 2011 The Association for the Publication
