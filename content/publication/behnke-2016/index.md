abstract: the products. Despite these uncertainties, gridded station data are often
  treated as observations by users for a par-ticular application. There is a risk
  that many users are unaware of the accuracy of the gridded product they choose and
  whether another choice might be more suitable for their purposes. Users will expect
  downscaled climate products to produce data that match local station data as closely
  as possible, particularly if gridded data have relatively high spatial resolution.
  The overall goal of our study is to evaluate the ability of eight widely used, gridded
  data sets to represent actual weather conditions in the conterminous United States,
  including extreme weather events. Specifically, our purpose is to evaluate how closely
  the gridded data match the original station data and thus what information may be
  altered when a user substitutes a gridded data set in place of meteorological station
  data. This concern is especially pertinent to extreme weather, which tends to be
  more localized than general weather phenomena, especially precipitation extremes.
  To achieve our goal, we focus on four major research questions. Our first question
  is how well gridded data sets capture temperature and precipitation, based on the
  expectation that performance may differ greatly between these vari-ables, because
  precipitation is generally more heteroge-neous than temperature in both space and
  time. Thus, we anticipated that gridded temperature data would resemble point measurements
  from nearby weather stations more closely than gridded precipitation data. Our second
  question is how the accuracy of different downscaled data sets varies among ecoregions.
  Climate differs considerably among ecoregions, as does topog-raphy, posing challenges
  for any one-size-fits-all downs-caling algorithm. Therefore, we expected that while
  one data set would perform best, for instance, in desert ecore-gions, another would
  be optimal in temperate forest regions. Similarly, given that topography will increase
  the spatial heterogeneity of both temperature and pre-cipitation, one data set may
  provide the highest accu-racies in mountainous ecoregions, while another may be
  optimal in flatter areas. Our third question is how well downscaled data sets capture
  means vs. extremes. Both mean climate and weather extremes are important for ecological
  research. Means are typically used to predict the effects of future climate change,
  but extremes may exert more immediate and profound effects on ecosystems (Jentsch
  et al. 2009). However, mean climate patterns are more homogeneous in both space
  and time than extremes, suggesting that differences in interpolation methods may
  result in dif-ferent accuracies, and we expected accuracies for means to be higher
  than for extremes. Our fourth and final question is how much the accuracy of the
  gridded products depends on their spatial resolution. Finer resolution is typically
  desirable for ecological applications, because many ecological patterns and processes
  vary at fairly fine resolutions (e.g., less than 1 km). However, while it is technically
  straightforward to create downscaled weather data sets at any spatial resolution,
  the question is whether the accuracy of the predicted patterns improves when inter-polated
  to finer scales. We expect that as their resolution becomes finer, gridded products
  will more closely align with nearby weather stations and be better able to account
  for topography, thus matching observational data more realistically, but that improvement
  could come with a greater risk of false precision and overfitted interpolation models.
