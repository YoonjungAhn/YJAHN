abstract: 'The National Association of Medical Examiners Ad Hoc Committee on the Definition
  of Heat-Related Fatalities recommends the following definition of \"heat-related
  death\": a death in which exposure to high ambient temperature either caused the
  death or significantly contributed to it. The committee also recommends that the
  diagnosis of heat-related death be based on a history of exposure to high ambient
  temperature and the reasonable exclusion of other causes of hyperthermia. The diagnosis
  may be established from the circumstances surrounding the death, investigative reports
  concerning environmental temperature, and/or measured antemortem body temperature
  at the time of collapse. In cases where the measured antemortem body temperature
  at the time of collapse was > or = 105 degrees F (> or = 40.6 degrees C), the cause
  of death should be certified as heat stroke or hyperthermia. Deaths may also be
  certified as heat stroke or hyperthermia with lower body temperatures when cooling
  has been attempted prior to arrival at the hospital and/or when there is a clinical
  history of mental status changes and elevated liver and muscle enzymes. In cases
  where the antemortem body temperature cannot be established but the environmental
  temperature at the time of collapse was high, an appropriate heat-related diagnosis
  should be listed as the cause of death or as a significant contributing condition.'
