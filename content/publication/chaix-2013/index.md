abstract: Recent studies have relied on GPS tracking to assess exposure to environmental
  characteristics over daily life schedules. Combining GPS and GIS allows for advances
  in environmental exposure assessment. However, biases related to selective daily
  mobility preclude assessment of environmental effects, to the extent that these
  studies may represent a step backward in terms of assessment of causal effects.
  A solution may be to integrate the Public health / Nutrition approach and the Transportation
  approach to GPS studies, so as to combine a GPS and accelerometer data collection
  with an electronic mobility survey. Correcting exposure measures and improving study
  designs with this approach may permit mitigating biases related to selective daily
  mobility.
