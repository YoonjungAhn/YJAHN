abstract: Random forest (RF) missing data algorithms are an attractive approach for
  imputing missing data. They have the desirable properties of being able to handle
  mixed types of missing data, they are adaptive to interactions and nonlinearity,
  and they have the potential to scale to big data settings. Currently there are many
  different RF imputation algorithms, but relatively little guidance about their efficacy.
  Using a large, diverse collection of data sets, imputation performance of various
  RF algorithms was assessed under different missing data mechanisms. Algorithms included
  proximity imputation, on the fly imputation, and imputation utilizing multivariate
  unsupervised and supervised splittingâ€”the latter class representing a generalization
  of a new promising imputation algorithm called missForest. Our findings reveal RF
  imputation to be generally robust with performance improving with increasing correlation.
  Performance was good under moderate to high missingness, and even (in certain cases)
  when data was missing not at random.
