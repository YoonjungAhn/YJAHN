abstract: This review explores the role of environments in creating chronic and acute
  health disorders. A general framework for studying the nesting of social environments
  and the multiple pathways by which environmental factors may adversely affect health
  is offered. Treating socioeconomic status (SES) and race as contextual factors,
  we examine characteristics of the environments of community, work, family, and peer
  interaction for predictors of positive and adverse health outcomes across the lifespan.
  We consider chronic stress/allostatic load, mental distress, coping skills and resources,
  and health habits and behaviors as classes of mechanisms that address how unhealthy
  environments get \"under the skin,\" to create health disorders. Across multiple
  environments, unhealthy environments are those that threaten safety, that undermine
  the creation of social ties, and that are conflictual, abusive, or violent. A healthy
  environment, in contrast, provides safety, opportunities for social integration,
  and the ability to predict and/or control aspects of that environment.
