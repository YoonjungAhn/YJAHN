abstract: Air pollution contributes to the global burden of disease, with ambient
  exposure to fine particulate matter of diameters smaller than 2.5&nbsp;μm (PM2.5)
  being identified as the fifth-ranking risk factor for mortality globally1. Racial/ethnic
  minorities and lower-income groups in the USA are at a higher risk of death from
  exposure to PM2.5 than are other population/income groups2–5. Moreover, disparities
  in exposure to air pollution among population and income groups are known to exist6–17.
  Here we develop a data platform that links demographic data (from the US Census
  Bureau and American Community Survey) and PM2.5 data18 across the USA. We analyse
  the data at the tabulation area level of US zip codes (N is approximately 32,000)&nbsp;between
  2000 and 2016. We show that areas with higher-than-average white and Native American
  populations have been consistently exposed to average PM2.5 levels that are lower
  than areas with higher-than-average Black, Asian and Hispanic or Latino populations.
  Moreover, areas with low-income populations have been consistently exposed to higher
  average PM2.5 levels than areas with high-income groups for the years 2004–2016.
  Furthermore, disparities in exposure relative to safety standards set by the US
  Environmental Protection Agency19 and the World Health Organization20 have been
  increasing over time. Our findings suggest that more-targeted PM2.5 reductions are
  necessary to provide all people with a similar degree of protection from environmental
  hazards. Our study is observational and cannot provide insight into the drivers
  of the identified disparities. Different racial/ethnic populations and income groups
  are found to have been exposed to different levels of air pollution in the USA during
  the years 2000 to 2016.
