abstract: 'Problem, research strategy, and findings: Historical patterns of discrimination
  and disinvestment have shaped the current landscape of vulnerability to heat in
  U.S. cities but are not explicitly considered by heat mitigation planning efforts.
  Drawing upon the equity planning framework and developing a broader conceptualization
  of what equity means can enhance urban heat management. Here I ask whether areas
  in Baltimore (MD), Dallas (TX), and Kansas City (MO) targeted for disinvestment
  in the past through practices like redlining are now more exposed to heat. I compare
  estimates of land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery across
  the four-category rating system used to guide lending practices in cities around
  the United States, summarize the demographic characteristics of current residents
  within each of these historical designations using U.S. Census data, and discuss
  the connection between systematic disinvestment and exposure to heat. LST and air
  temperatures are not equivalent, which makes it difficult to reconcile existing
  research on the human health impacts of heat exposure that rely on a sparse network
  of air temperature monitoring stations with more granular LST data. Areas of these
  cities that were targeted for systematic disinvestment in the past have higher mean
  land surface temperatures than those that received more favorable ratings. Poor
  and minority residents are also overrepresented in formerly redlined areas in each
  of the three study cities. Takeaway for practice: By examining areas that have experienced
  sustained disinvestment, cities may be able to more quickly narrow the focus of
  heat mitigation planning efforts while furthering social equity. Efforts to mitigate
  the negative impacts of rising temperatures in U.S. cities must be tailored to the
  local climate, built environment, and sociodemographic history. Finally, geospatial
  data sets that document historical policies are useful for centering and redressing
  current inequalities when viewed through an equity planning lens.'
