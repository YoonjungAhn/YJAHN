abstract: Solar radiation incident at the Earth’s surface (Rs) is an essential component
  of the total energy exchange between the atmosphere and the surface. Reanalysis
  data have been widely used, but a comprehensive validation using surface measurements
  is still highly needed. In this study, we evaluated the Rs estimates from six current
  representative global reanalyses (NCEP–NCAR, NCEP-DOE; CFSR; ERA-Interim; MERRA;
  and JRA-55) using surface measurements from different observation networks [GEBA;
  BSRN; GC-NET; Buoy; and CMA] (674 sites in total) and the Earth’s Radiant Energy
  System (CERES) EBAF product from 2001 to 2009. The global mean biases between the
  reanalysis Rs and surface measurements at all sites ranged from 11.25 W/m2 to 49.80
  W/m2. Comparing with the CERES-EBAF Rs product, all the reanalyses overestimate
  Rs, except for ERA-Interim, with the biases ranging from −2.98 W/m2 to 21.97 W/m2
  over the globe. It was also found that the biases of cloud fraction (CF) in the
  reanalyses caused the overestimation of Rs. After removing the averaged bias of
  CERES-EBAF, weighted by the area of the latitudinal band, a global annual mean Rs
  values of 184.6 W/m2, 180.0 W/m2, and 182.9 W/m2 were obtained over land, ocean,
  and the globe, respectively.
