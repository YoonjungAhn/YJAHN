 abstract = {Mountains, through atmospheric processes, play an integrated role in weather systems and climate systems. In turn, weather and climate over and nearby mountains are modified depending on environmental conditions. Mountain size, shape, slope, aspect ratio, and orientation along the water sources affect the weather systems; they can intensify fronts, eddies, vortex, rotors and turbulence, visibility, and precipitation. Depending on their location and height, precipitation type as snow over the mountains contributes significantly to hydrometeorological cycle and ecosystem. Increasing temperatures because of a possible climate change can reduce river discharges during warm seasons. Therefore, accurate measurements of climate change impact on the mountains are required. On the other hand, obtaining measurements over the mountainous regions are extremely difficult because of strong winds, cold temperatures (<0°C), mountain slopes, and heavy snow precipitation as well as instrumental issues. New developments on measurement strategies and instruments, and developing multiscale numerical models with detailed cloud microphysical processes and boundary layer parameterizations can reduce uncertainties in the weather and climate prediction. In this review, the challenges related to collecting measurements, numerical model predictions, and climate change issues over and nearby mountains will be emphasized.},
