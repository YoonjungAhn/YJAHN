abstract: 'This paper reports the preliminary results of a project on using IKONOS
  imagery to estimate the size and spatial distribution of urban residential population.
  Three questions were addressed. Firstly, the utility of a textural classifier based
  on Gray Level Cooccurance Matrix (GLCM) to interpret IKONOS imagery was examined.
  It is found that although texture is useful, other types of information, such as
  spectral reflectance, is necessary to obtain satisfactory accuracy. Secondly, the
  relationship between the size of an urban area and its population was examined for
  three spatial units: census tracts, land use polygon, and the intersection of the
  two. Results show there exists a linear relationship between the natural log of
  the size and total population when land use polygon is used as the spatial unit.
  Lastly, the identified relationship was applied to population estimation. Although
  the overall accuracy is as high as 92%, significant underestimations and overestimations
  exist especially for areas with the highest or lowest population density. In addition
  to size, factors such as distance to central business district, accessibility to
  major roads, slope, and age of a developed area also contribute to population distribution.
  A case study of Santa Barbara, USA is presented.'
