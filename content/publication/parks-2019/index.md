abstract: Measuring and identifying the correlates and drivers of mortality are key
  functions of public health research. Information on seasonal mortality, and its
  inter-annual variations, enables prioritising and evaluating interventions during
  particular times of the year. It also provides the basis to study the association
  of death rates with seasonal temperature. My thesis aimed to provide and apply a
  statistical framework to characterise seasonality of death rates by cause of death,
  month, sex and age group, and to understand the role of temperature as a predictor,
  and possibly determinant, of how seasonal mortality changes from year to year and
  geographically. I generated death rates from geo-coded vital registration data on
  all 85.5 million deaths in the entire contiguous United States over a 37-year period
  (1980-2016). I grouped the underlying causes of death into mutually exclusive and
  collectively exhaustive broad causes (cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, injuries,
  other) along with further sub-causes for cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries.
  I processed ERA-Interim reanalysis weather data to create population-weighted monthly
  temperature statistics. I applied wavelet, centre of gravity and circular statistics
  methods to analyse seasonal dynamics of mortality. I found that overall death rates
  for those 45 years and older were highest in the winter, mostly due to cardiorespiratory
  disease deaths. In contrast, death rates in adolescents and young adults peaked
  in the summer, mostly due to injury deaths. Seasonal differences in older age groups
  have changed little over time, whereas in young children they have largely disappeared.
  I then formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to estimate how anomalous monthly
  temperature - defined as temperature deviation compared to long-term norm for each
  state and month - affects deaths from different causes. A 1Â°C anomalously warm year
  in the entire contiguous United States would be associated with an estimated 941
  (95% credible interval (CrI) 831, 1,053) additional injury deaths (0.5% of total
  injury deaths in 2016), concentrated in adolescent to middle-aged males. There would
  be an estimated 4,369 (4,024, 4,706) fewer cardiorespiratory disease deaths (0.4%
  of total cardiorespiratory disease deaths in 2016), concentrated in those 55 years
  and older. There would be a decrease of cardiorespiratory disease deaths in all
  but summer months. I found no association between anomalous monthly temperature
  and cancer deaths. Continued efforts are necessary to address seasonal peaks in
  mortality, particularly in older age groups, across the United States, especially
  in a changing climate.
