abstract: 'Background: Extreme temperature is associated with adverse birth outcomes
  but it is unclear whether it increases early delivery risk. Objectives: We aimed
  to determine the association between ambient temperature and early delivery. Methods:
  Medical records from 223,375 singleton deliveries from 12 U.S. sites were linked
  to local ambient temperature. Exposure to hot (> 90th percentile) or cold (< 10th
  percentile) using site-specific and window-specific temperature distributions were
  defined for 3-months preconception, 7-week periods during the first two trimesters,
  1 week preceding delivery, and whole pregnancy. Poisson regression with generalized
  estimating equations calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval
  for early deliveries associated with hot/cold exposures, adjusting for conception
  month, humidity, site, sex, maternal demographics, parity, insurance, prepregnancy
  body mass index, pregnancy complications, and smoking or drinking during pregnancy.
  Acute temperature associations were estimated separately for warm (May–September)
  and cold season (October–April) in a case-crossover analysis using conditional logistic
  regression. Results: Compared with mild temperature (10–90th percentile), exposure
  to hot or cold during weeks 1–7 increased risk for early preterm (< 34 weeks) [RRhot:
  1.11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.21); RRcold: 1.20 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.30)], late preterm (34–36
  weeks) [RRcold: 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15)], and early term (37–38 weeks) [RRhot:
  1.04 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.07); RRcold: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.05)] delivery. Findings
  were similar for hot exposures during weeks 15–21. Examining deliveries at each
  week from 23 through 38, whole-pregnancy hot exposures increased delivery risk by
  6–21% at weeks 34 and 36–38. In the case-crossover analysis, a 5°F increase during
  the week preceding delivery was associated with 12–16% higher and 4–5% lower early
  delivery risk during warm and cold season, respectively. Conclusions: Both acute
  and chronic ambient temperature extremes may affect early delivery risk.'
