abstract: "Air pollution from motor vehicles harms the health of those who live near
  freeways and other high-traffic roads. Land use regulations may permit, prohibit,
  or impose special conditions on housing near major roadways. This paper answers
  two questions: First, how is residential development near major roadways regulated?
  Second, how common are zoning changes near major roadways, and what factors explain
  these changes? This paper compares the zoning designations of near-roadway parcels
  with others in the city, and uses two sets of logistic regression models to analyze
  near-roadway zoning. The results show that residential development is permitted
  on most near-roadway parcels, including more than 92% of those within 500 feet of
  a freeway. One of the main explanations is that Los Angeles's hierarchical zoning
  structure allows housing development in most commercial zones. While many of these
  parcels have commercial development today, they could be redeveloped for residential
  uses in the future. Larger shares of near-roadway parcels were upzoned to allow
  higher residential densities compared with parcels elsewhere in the city, but this
  difference is explained by other locational factors."
