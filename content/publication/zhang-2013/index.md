abstract: "Adelaide experienced an extreme and prolonged 13. days heatwave in summer
  2009. The health impacts of this heatwave included an almost 14-fold increase in
  direct heat-related hospital admissions. This study aims to investigate the risk
  factors for this extra health burden. A case crossover study was conducted in metropolitan
  Adelaide to compare the characteristics of patients from the heatwave (exposure)
  period and non-heatwave (control) periods before and after. Direct heat-related
  hospitalizations were identified based on the ICD-10 codes (X30, T67, and E86).
  Patients' data, including age, gender, indicators of health status, living conditions
  and socio-economic status, were collected from the South Australian Department of
  Health and patients' case-notes from seven major Adelaide hospitals. Multivariate
  logistic regression model was used to estimate the odd ratios (OR) and the 95% confidence
  intervals (CI). Results indicate that living at residential aged care (OR=0.41,
  95% CI: 0.15-0.70) and having higher number of co-morbidities (OR=0.89, 95% CI:
  0.83-0.95) reduced the risk of hospital admission for direct heat-related illnesses
  during the heatwave, while having renal problems (OR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.07-2.94), reporting
  a fall prior to hospitalization (OR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.10-3.77), receiving assistance
  from community (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.24-4.30), living alone (OR=2.41, 95% CI: 1.32-4.40),
  socio-economic disadvantage (OR=2.10, 95% CI: 1.09-4.04) and no private health insurance
  (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.05-3.16) increased the risk. In conclusion, the people most
  at risk during the 2009 heatwave in Adelaide were those who lived alone, received
  help from community services, with co-existing renal problems or a risk of falls,
  and with a lower socio-economic status. Findings will assist in refining heat-health
  response systems and developing intervention programmes. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V."
