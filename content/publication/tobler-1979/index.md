abstract: Census enumerations are usually packaged in irregularly shaped geographical
  regions. Interior values can be interpolated for such regions, without specification
  of “control points,” by using an analogy to elliptical partial differential equations.
  A solution procedure is suggested, using finite difference methods with classical
  boundary conditions. In order to estimate densities, an additional nonnegativity
  condition is required. Smooth contour maps, which satisfy the volume preserving
  and nonnegativity constraints, illustrate the method using actual geographical data.
  It is suggested that the procedure may be used to convert observations from one
  bureaucratic partitioning of a geographical area to another. © 1979, Taylor & Francis
