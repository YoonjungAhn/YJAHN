abstract: The WBGT heat stress index has been well tested under a variety of climatic
  conditions and quantitative links have been established between WBGT and the work-rest
  cycles needed to prevent heat stress effects at the workplace. While there are more
  specific methods based on individual physiological measurements to determine heat
  strain in an individual worker, the WBGT index is used in international and national
  standards to specify workplace heat stress risks. In order to assess time trends
  of occupational heat exposure at population level, weather station records or climate
  modelling are the most widely available data sources. The prescribed method to measure
  WBGT requires special equipment which is not used at weather stations. We compared
  published methods to calculate outdoor and indoor WBGT from standard climate data,
  such as air temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and solar radiation.
  Specific criteria for recommending a method were developed and original measurements
  were used to evaluate the different methods. We recommend the method of Liljegren
  et al. (2008) for calculating outdoor WBGT and the method by Bernard et al. (1999)
  for indoor WBGT when estimating climate change impacts on occupational heat stress
  at a population level. Â© 2012 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.
