abstract: Medical geography has become part of the theoretical and substantive development
  of human ecology through the work of Jacques May, E. Pavlovsky, Ralph Audy, and
  others. To study holistically the interactions of a population with its environment
  and the resultant state of health, one needs to distort, simplify, and arbitrarily
  delimit complex reality as little as possible. The most critical factor in etiology
  is the exposure of people to hazards, so an approach to initial analysis would ideally
  model interactions by centering on behavioral patterns. The analysis of population
  movement at various scales offers one such unobtrusive method, as this study of
  population movement in Malaysia illustrates.
