abstract: A dasymetric map depicts a statistical surface, most commonly population
  density, as a set of simply connected regions, such that variation within each region
  is minimized and the region boundaries approximate the steepest escarpments of the
  surface. Dasymetric mapping has its roots in early thematic mapping of population,
  but has recently been taken up by researchers focusing on areal interpolation and
  population estimation using remote sensing. The process of dasymetric mapping typically
  involves the disaggregation of population data encoded in choropleth map form using
  an ancillary spatial data set, most commonly either an area-class map or satellite
  image. The functional relationship between the ancillary data and the statistical
  surface being mapped may be specified a priori by the researcher or estimated using
  a variety of statistical techniques. Challenges facing dasymetric mapping research
  include handling spatio-temporal data and the development of standardized and accessible
  methods. Â© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
