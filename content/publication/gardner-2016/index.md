abstract: ' Although the lethal consequences of extreme heat are increasingly reported
  in the literature, the fitness costs of exposure to sublethal high air temperatures,
  typically identified in the 30–40°C range, are poorly understood. We examine the
  effect of high (≥35°C) daily maxima on body condition of a semiarid population of
  White‐plumed Honeyeaters, Ptilotula penicillatus , monitored between 1986 and 2012.
  During this 26‐yr period, temperature has risen, on average, by 0.06°C each year
  at the site, the frequency of days with thermal maxima ≥35°C has increased and rainfall
  has declined. Exposure to high temperatures affected body condition of White‐plumed
  Honeyeaters, but only in low‐rainfall conditions. There was no effect of a single
  day of exposure to temperatures ≥35°C but repeated exposure was associated with
  reduced body condition: 3.0% reduction in body mass per day of exposure. Rainfall
  in the previous 30 d ameliorated these effects, with reduced condition evident only
  in dry conditions. Heat‐exposed males with reduced body condition were less likely
  to be recaptured at the start of the following spring; they presumably died. Heat‐exposed
  females, regardless of body condition, showed lower survival than exposed males,
  possibly due to their smaller body mass. The higher mortality of females and smaller
  males exposed to temperatures ≥35°C may have contributed to the increase in mean
  body size of this population over 23 years. Annual survival declined across time
  concomitant with increasing frequency of days ≥35°C and decreasing rainfall. Our
  study is one of few to identify a proximate cause of climate change related mortality,
  and associated long‐term demographic consequence. Our results have broad implications
  for avian communities living in arid and semiarid regions of Australia, and other
  mid‐latitudes regions where daily maximum temperatures already approach physiological
  limits in regions affected by both decreased precipitation and warming. '
