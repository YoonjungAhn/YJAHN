abstract: 'Local zoning codes affect a broad range of policies. For example, they
  can constrain housing supply and create affordability challenges (Ikeda and Washington
  2015; Glaeser and Ward 2006), contribute to housing segregation (Greene at al. 2017;
  Pendall 2000), and determine how well a jurisdiction responds to changes in demographics
  and climate (Micklow and Warner 2014; Nolon 2013). Despite the importance of local
  zoning regulations, research that measures the restrictiveness of zoning laws across
  places and the impact of restrictive zoning across a range of outcomes is remarkably
  thin. One reason is that zoning codes are long, technical, and difficult to access.
  Consequently, there is no up-to-date national dataset or reliable standard practice
  used to compare zoning codes. To address this gap, we explore whether it is possible
  to merge property assessment records with granular data on zoning policies to generate
  a model that \"predicts\" zoning regulations. Using such a model, we could build
  an accurate, publicly accessible dataset of zoning regulations across the US. In
  this paper, we test this hypothesis with a proof of concept in Washington, DC. We
  combine property assessment records provided by Zillow (ZTRAX) with data from the
  Washington, DC, Office of Zoning, and using a random forest regression, predict
  zoning characteristics in zones with residences. We find that we are able to use
  property records to predict density limits with a relatively high degree of accuracy.
  Our model itself is exploratory and has many limitations: it uses a relatively small
  set of zones and depends greatly on how properties with missing zone designations
  are assigned to zones. Additionally, model predictions are largely directional,
  and vary in accuracy by zone type. We focus on one variable in the zoning code-density
  limits-and one city-Washington, DC-and thus more work is needed to determine whether
  the model can generalize to different jurisdictions and zoning regulations. Yet,
  preliminary directional success suggests that pursuing this work at a larger scale
  would be fruitful, and it would offer significant benefit to researchers seeking
  to study the effects of zoning across a wide array of policy domains.'
