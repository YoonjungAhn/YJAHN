abstract: We propose a vector alternative to the typical raster based population modeling
  framework. When compared with rasters, vectors are more precise, have the ability
  to hold more information, and are more conducive to areal constructs such as building
  and parcel outlines. While rasters have traditionally provided computational efficiency,
  much of this efficiency is reduced at finer resolutions and computational resources
  are more plentiful today. Herein we describe the approach and implementation methodology.
  We also describe the output data stack for the United States and provide examples
  and applications.
