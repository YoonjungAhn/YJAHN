 abstract = {This vignette dlnmTS illustrates the use of the R package dlnm for the application of distributed lag linear and non-linear models (DLMs and DLNMs) in time series analysis. The development of DLMs and DLNMs and the original software implementation for time series data are illustrated in Gasparrini et al. (2010) and Gasparrini (2011). The examples described in the next sections cover most of the standard applications of the DLNM methodology for time series data, and explore the capabilities of the dlnm package for specifying, summarizing and plotting this class of models. In spite of the specific application on the health effects of air pollution and temperature, these examples are easily generalized to different topics, and form a basis for the analysis of this data set or other time series data sources. The results included in this document are not meant to represent scientific findings, but are reported with the only purpose of illustrating the capabilities of the dlnm package. An overview of functions included in the package, with information on its installation and a brief summary of the DLNM methodology are included in the vignette dlnmOverview, which represents the main documentation of dlnm. The user can refer to that vignette for a general introduction to the usage and structure of the functions. Type citation("dlnm") in R to cite the dlnm package after installation (see the related section the vignette dlnmOverview). General information on the development and applications of the DLNM modelling framework, together with an updated version of the R scripts for running the examples in published papers, can be found at www.ag-myresearch.com.},
