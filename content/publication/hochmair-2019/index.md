abstract: Sports and fitness apps on GPS enabled cell phones and smart watches have
  become a rich source of GPS tracking data for nonmotorized traffic, including walking,
  running, and cycling. These crowd-sourced data can be analyzed to better understand
  the cycling behavior of a large user community. Using Strava tracking data from
  the Miami-Dade County area, this study identifies which transport network measures,
  characteristics of the built environment, and sociodemographic factors are associated
  with increased or decreased bicycle ridership in census block groups. For this purpose,
  a set of linear regression models are estimated to predict non-commute and commute
  bicycle kilometers travelled per block group, as well as bicycle kilometers travelled
  on weekends and weekdays. Eigenvector spatial filtering is applied to explicitly
  model spatial autocorrelation and to avoid parameter estimation bias. Results suggest
  that Strava data, due to its high spatial resolution and coverage, can identify
  in detail how the influence of explanatory variables on estimated bicycle trip volume
  varies between different trip purposes and days of the week. Based on the regression
  results, the paper presents a set of guidelines for practical design detailing which
  groups of cyclists would benefit most from specific bicycle infrastructure improvements.
