abstract: Identifying and characterizing urban vulnerability to heat is a key step
  in designing intervention strategies to combat negative consequences of extreme
  heat on human health. This study combines excess non-accidental mortality counts,
  numerical weather simulations, US Census and parcel data into an assessment of vulnerability
  to heat in Houston, Texas. Specifically, a hierarchical model with spatially varying
  coefficients is used to account for differences in vulnerability among census block
  groups. Socio-economic and demographic variables from census and parcel data are
  selected via a forward selection algorithm where at each step the remaining variables
  are orthogonalized with respect to the chosen variables to account for collinearity.
  Daily minimum temperatures and composite heat indices (e.g. discomfort index) provide
  a better model fit than other ambient temperature measurements (e.g. maximum temperature,
  relative humidity). Positive interactions between elderly populations and heat exposure
  were found suggesting these populations are more responsive to increases in heat.
