abstract: 'Background: Against the background of demographic prognosis and the increasing
  risk of heat waves, the vulnerability of aged people in need of care for heat stress
  forces preventive efforts in nursing homes. Objectives: In this review, current
  epidemiological and physiological evidence about risk reduction measures in cases
  of high indoor temperatures in nursing homes is reported. Preventive approaches
  are discussed in the context of general conditions in nursing homes. Results: Constructional
  measures promise to be most effective. Depending on the thermal conditions of the
  building, there will be a need for timely action. Preventive measures include the
  reduction of exposure and measures that target reducing the susceptibility of the
  residents to heat, the latter requiring close collaboration between physicians and
  nurses. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.'
