 abstract = {Background: Against the background of demographic prognosis and the increasing risk of heat waves, the vulnerability of aged people in need of care for heat stress forces preventive efforts in nursing homes. Objectives: In this review, current epidemiological and physiological evidence about risk reduction measures in cases of high indoor temperatures in nursing homes is reported. Preventive approaches are discussed in the context of general conditions in nursing homes. Results: Constructional measures promise to be most effective. Depending on the thermal conditions of the building, there will be a need for timely action. Preventive measures include the reduction of exposure and measures that target reducing the susceptibility of the residents to heat, the latter requiring close collaboration between physicians and nurses. © 2011 Springer Medizin Verlag.},
