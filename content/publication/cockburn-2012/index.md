abstract: Geocoding is often used to produce maps of disease rates from the diagnosis
  addresses of incident cases to assist with disease surveillance, prevention, and
  control. In this process, diagnosis addresses are converted into latitude/longitude
  pairs which are then aggregated to produce rates at varying geographic scales such
  as Census tracts, neighborhoods, cities, counties, and states. The specific techniques
  used within geocoding systems have an impact on where the output geocode is located
  and can therefore have an effect on the derivation of disease rates at different
  geographic aggregations. This paper investigates how county-level cancer rates are
  affected by the choice of interpolation method when case data are geocoded to the
  ZIP code level. Four commonly used areal unit interpolation techniques are applied
  and the output of each is used to compute crude county-level five-year incidence
  rates of all cancers in California. We found that the rates observed for 44 out
  of the 58 counties in California vary based on which interpolation method is used,
  with rates in some counties increasing by nearly 400% between interpolation methods.
