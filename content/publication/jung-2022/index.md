abstract: 'Immigrants may be more vulnerable to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
  than other sub-population groups due to their relatively low socioeconomic status.
  However, no quantitative studies have examined the relationships between immigrants
  and COVID-19 health outcomes (confirmed cases and related deaths). We first examined
  the relationship between total immigrants and COVID-19 health outcomes with spatial
  Durbin models after controlling for demographic, biophysical and socioeconomic variables.
  We then repeated the same analysis within multiple subimmigrant groups divided by
  those with original nativity to examine the differential associations with health
  outcomes. The result showed that the proportion of all immigrants is negatively
  associated with the number of confirmed cases and related deaths. At the continent
  and sub-continent level, we consistently found negative relationships between the
  number of confirmed cases and the proportion of all sub-immigrant groups. However,
  we observed mixed associations between the proportion of sub-immigrant groups and
  the number of deaths. Those counties having a higher prevalence of immigrants from
  Africa [Eastern Africa: –18.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): –38.3~–2.9; Northern
  Africa: –146.5, 95% CI: –285.5~–20.1; Middle Africa: –622.6, 95% CI: –801.4~– 464.5]
  and the Americas (Northern America: –90.5, 95% CI: – 106.1~–73.8; Latin America:
  –6.8, 95% CI: –8.1~–5.2) mostly had a lower number of deaths, whereas those counties
  having a higher prevalence of immigrants from Asia (Eastern Asia: 21.0, 95% CI:
  7.7~36.2; Western Asia: 42.5, 95% CI: 16.9~68.8; South- Central Asia: 26.6, 95%
  CI: 15.5~36.9) showed a higher number of deaths. Our results partially support that
  some immigrants, especially those from Asia, are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than
  other sub-population groups.'
