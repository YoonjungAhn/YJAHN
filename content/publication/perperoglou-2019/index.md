abstract: 'Background: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational
  fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical
  regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability
  of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening
  Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance
  documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the
  aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based
  techniques and their implementation in R. Methods: In this work, we focus on the
  R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics
  software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling
  within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction
  to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions. Results:
  We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis
  functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable.
  Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different
  results. Conclusions: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when
  working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters
  rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain
  a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts
  do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will
  need more guidance.'
