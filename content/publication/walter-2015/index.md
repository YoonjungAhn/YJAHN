abstract: The increase in socioeconomic disparity between households runs counter
  to federal housing goals to improve the prospects of the poor. One goal of the Housing
  Choice Voucher (HCV) program, which provides rental assistance to low-income families,
  is the deconcentration of poverty. This study is a longitudinal analysis of the
  HCV program's deconcentration effectiveness in Broward County, Florida. The movement
  of HCV households before and after voucher assignment is examined. Spatial statistics
  reveal that HCV recipients are highly clustered in low opportunity areas both prior
  to and after receiving a voucher. Factors that significantly relate to the likelihood
  that a voucher recipient will or will not move to an area of higher opportunity
  are assessed. Results from an opportunity index derived from principal components
  analysis and an ordinary least squares regression model indicate that being non-Black,
  having a larger household, and originating from economically distressed areas with
  high poverty and unemployment relates more strongly to relocation to neighborhoods
  with greater opportunity.
