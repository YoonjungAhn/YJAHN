abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated air pollution exposure disparities
  by race/ethnicity and income across criteria air pollutants, locations, or time.
  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to quantify exposure disparities by race/ethnicity
  and income throughout the contiguous United States for six criteria air pollutants,
  during the period 1990 to 2010. METHODS: We quantified exposure disparities among
  racial/ethnic groups (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic (any race),
  nonHispanic Asian) and by income for multiple spatial units (contiguous United States,
  states, urban vs. rural areas) and years (1990, 2000, 2010) for carbon monoxide
  (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter
  ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5; excluding year-1990), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter
  ≤10 μm (PM10), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). We used census data for demographic information
  and a national empirical model for ambient air pollution levels. RESULTS: For all
  years and pollutants, the racial/ethnic group with the highest national average
  exposure was a racial/ethnic minority group. In 2010, the disparity between the
  racial/ethnic group with the highest vs. lowest national-average exposure was largest
  for NO2 [54% (4.6 ppb)], smallest for O3 [3.6% (1.6 ppb)], and intermediate for
  the remaining pollutants (13%-19%). The disparities varied by U.S. state; for example,
  for PM2.5 in 2010, exposures were at least 5% higher than average in 63% of states
  for non-Hispanic Black populations; in 33% and 26% of states for Hispanic and for
  non-Hispanic Asian populations, respectively; and in no states for non-Hispanic
  White populations. Absolute exposure disparities were larger among racial/ethnic
  groups than among income categories (range among pollutants: Between 1.1 and 21
  times larger). Over the period studied, national absolute racial/ethnic exposure
  disparities declined by between 35% (0.66 μg/m3; PM2.5) and 88% (0.35 ppm; CO);
  relative disparities declined to between 0.99 × (PM2.5; i.e., nearly zero change)
  and 0.71 × (CO; i.e., a ∼29% reduction).'
