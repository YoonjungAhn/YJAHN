abstract: Â© 2014 Hirsch, James, Robinson, Eastman, Conley, Evenson and Laden. It is
  difficult to obtain detailed information on the context of physical activity at
  large geographic scales, such as the entire United States, as well as over long
  periods of time, such as over years. MapMyFitness is a suite of interactive tools
  for individuals to track theirworkouts online or using global positioning system
  in their phones or other wireless trackers. This method article discusses the use
  of physical activity data tracked using MapMyFitness to examine patterns over space
  and time. An overview of MapMyFitness, including data tracked, user information,
  and geographic scope, is explored. We illustrate the utility of MapMyFitness data
  using tracked physical activity by users in Winston-Salem, NC, USA between 2006
  and 2013. Types of physical activities tracked are described, as well as the percent
  of activities occurring in parks. Strengths of MapMyFitness data include objective
  data collection, low participant burden, extensive geographic scale, and longitudinal
  series. Limitations include generalizability, behavioral change as the result of
  technology use, and potential ethical considerations. MapMyFitness is a powerful
  tool to investigate patterns of physical activity across large geographic and temporal
  scales.
