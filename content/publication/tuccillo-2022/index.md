abstract: 'The ability to produce richly-attributed synthetic populations is key for
  understanding human dynamics, responding to emergencies, and preparing for future
  events, all while protecting individual privacy. The Like-ness toolkit accomplishes
  these goals with a suite of Python packages: pymedm/pymedm_legacy, livelike, and
  actlike. This production process is initialized in pymedm (or pymedm_legacy) that
  utilizes census microdata records as the foundation on which disaggregated spatial
  allocation matrices are built. The next step, performed by livelike, is the generation
  of a fully autonomous agent population attributed with hundreds of demographic census
  variables. The agent population synthesized in livelike is then attributed with
  residential coordinates in actlike based on block assignment and, finally, allocated
  to an optimal daytime activity location via the street network. We present a case
  study in Knox County, Tennessee, synthesizing 30 populations of public K-12 school
  students & teachers and allocating them to schools. Validation of our results shows
  they are highly promising by replicating reported school enrollment and teacher
  capacity with a high degree of fidelity.'
