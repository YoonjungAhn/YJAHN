 abstract = {The Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is an international standard heat index used by the health, industrial, sports, and climate sectors to assess thermal comfort during heat extremes. Observations of its components, the globe and the wet bulb temperature (WBT), are however sparse. Therefore WBGT is difficult to derive, making it common to rely on approximations, such as the ones developed by Liljegren etÂ al. (2008, https://doi.org/10.1080/15459620802310770, (Formula presented.)) and by the American College of Sports Medicine ((Formula presented.)). In this study, a global data set is created by implementing an updated WBGT method using ECMWF ERA5 gridded meteorological variables and is evaluated against existing WBGT methods. The new method, (Formula presented.), uses globe temperature calculated using mean radiant temperature and is found to be accurate in comparison to (Formula presented.) across three heatwave case studies. In addition, it is found that (Formula presented.) is not an adequate approximation of WBGT. Our new method is a candidate for a global forecasting early warning system.},
