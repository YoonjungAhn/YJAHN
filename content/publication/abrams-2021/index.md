abstract: Data from 25 large U.S. cities is assembled to estimate the impact of the
  onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime. There is a widespread immediate drop in
  both criminal incidents and arrests most heavily pronounced among drug crimes, theft,
  residential burglaries, and most violent crimes. The decline appears to precede
  stay-at-home orders, and arrests follow a similar pattern as reports. There is no
  decline in homicides and shootings, and an increase in non-residential burglary
  and car theft in most cities, suggesting that criminal activity was displaced to
  locations with fewer people. Pittsburgh, New York City, San Francisco, Philadelphia,
  Washington DC and Chicago each saw overall crime drops of at least 35%. Evidence
  from police-initiated reports and geographic variation in crime change suggests
  that most of the observed changes are not due to changes in crime reporting.
