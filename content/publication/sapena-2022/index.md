abstract: 'High-resolution population mapping is of high relevance for developing
  and implementing tailored actions in several fields: From decision making in crisis
  management to urban planning. Earth Observation has considerably contributed to
  the development of methods for disaggregating population figures with higher resolution
  data into fine-grained population maps. However, which method is most suitable on
  the basis of the available data, and how the spatial units and accuracy metrics
  affect the validation process is not fully known. We aim to provide recommendations
  to researches that attempt to produce high-resolution population maps using remote
  sensing and geospatial information in heterogeneous urban landscapes. For this purpose,
  we performed a comprehensive experimental research on population disaggregation
  methods with thirty-six different scenarios. We combined five different top-down
  methods (from basic to complex, i.e., binary and categorical dasymetric, statistical,
  and binary and categorical hybrid approaches) on different subsets of data with
  diverse resolutions and degrees of availability (poor, average and rich). Then,
  the resulting population maps were systematically validated with a two-fold approach
  using six accuracy metrics. We found that when only using remotely sensed data the
  combination of statistical and dasymetric methods provide better results, while
  highly-resolved data require simpler methods. Besides, the use of at least three
  relative accuracy metrics is highly encouraged since the validation depends on level
  and method. We also analysed the behaviour of relative errors and how they are affected
  by the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. We hope that our recommendations save
  additional efforts and time in future population mapping.'
