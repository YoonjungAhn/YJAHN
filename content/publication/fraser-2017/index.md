abstract: 'Access to air conditioned space is critical for protecting urban populations
  from the adverse effects of heat exposure. Yet there remains fairly limited knowledge
  of the penetration of private (home air conditioning) and distribution of public
  (cooling centers and commercial space) cooled space across cities. Furthermore,
  the deployment of government-sponsored cooling centers is likely to be inadequately
  informed with respect to the location of existing cooling resources (residential
  air conditioning and air conditioned public space), raising questions of the equitability
  of access to heat refuges. We explore the distribution of private and public cooling
  resources and access inequities at the household level in two major US urban areas:
  Los Angeles County, California and Maricopa County, Arizona (whose county seat is
  Phoenix). We evaluate the presence of in-home air conditioning and develop a walking-based
  accessibility measure to air conditioned public space using a combined cumulative
  opportunities-gravity approach. We find significant variations in the distribution
  of residential air conditioning across both regions which are largely attributable
  to building age and inter/intra-regional climate differences. There are also'
