abstract: Excess mortality not directly related to the virus has been shown to have
  increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in heat-related mortality
  during the pandemic have not been addressed in detail. Here, we performed an observational
  study crossing daily mortality data collected in Portugal (SICO/DGS) with high-resolution
  temperature series (ERA5/ECMWF), characterizing their relation in the pre-pandemic,
  and how it aggravated during 2020. The combined result of COVID-19 and extreme temperatures
  caused the largest annual mortality burden in recent decades (~ 12 000 excess deaths
  [~ 11% above baseline]). COVID-19 caused the largest fraction of excess mortality
  during March to May (62%) and from October onwards (85%). During summer, its direct
  impact was residual, and deaths not reported as COVID-19 dominated excess mortality
  (553 versus 3 968). A prolonged hot spell led mortality to the upper tertile, reaching
  its peak in mid-July (+ 45% deaths/day). The lethality ratio (+ 14 deaths per cumulated
  ºC) was higher than that observed in recent heatwaves. We used a statistical model
  to estimate expected deaths due to cold/heat, indicating an amplification of at
  least 50% in heat-related deaths during 2020 compared to pre-pandemic years. Our
  findings suggest mortality during 2020 has been indirectly amplified by the COVID-19
  pandemic, due to the disruption of healthcare systems and fear of population in
  attending healthcare facilities (expressed in emergency room admissions decreases).
  While lockdown measures and healthcare systems reorganization prevented deaths directly
  related to the virus, a significant burden due to other causes represents a strong
  secondary impact. This was particularly relevant during summer hot spells, when
  the lethality ratio reached magnitudes not experienced since the 2003 heatwaves.
  This severe amplification of heat-related mortality during 2020 stresses the need
  to resume normal healthcare services and public health awareness.
