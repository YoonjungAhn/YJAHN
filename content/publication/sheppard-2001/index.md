abstract: Representations of quantitative geography, both by practitioners and by
  others, have tended to associate quantification with empiricism, positivism, and
  the social and academic status quo. Qualitative geography, by contrast is represented
  as nonempiricist or postempiricist, sensitive to complexity, contextual, and capable
  of empowering nonmainstream academic approaches and social groups. Attempts to engage
  in debate between these positions rarely challenge this dualism, reproducing the
  representation of quantitative geography as logical positivism, and a dualism separating
  quantitative and qualitative geography. I argue that this dualism can be broken
  down, by deconstructing the underlying representation. I discuss why this representation
  came into existence and how it was stabilized; how close attention to the practices
  of quantitative geographers, and particularly to the evolution of these practices,
  reveals its inadequacies; and what new possibilities for quantitative practices
  emerge from this deconstruction. GIS, one of the recent manifestations around which
  representations of quantitative geography polarize, is used as a case study to illustrate
  these arguments. I pay particular attention to the question of the relevance of
  quantitative practices for an emancipatory human geography.
