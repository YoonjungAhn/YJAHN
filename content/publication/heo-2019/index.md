abstract: 'Despite the active applications of thermal comfort indices for heat wave
  definitions, there is lack of evaluation for the impact of extended days of high
  temperature on health outcomes using many of the indices. This study compared the
  impact of heat waves on health outcomes among different heat wave definitions based
  on thermal comfort and air temperature. We compared heat waves in South Korea (cities
  and provinces) for the warm season for 2011–2014, using air temperature, heat index
  (HI), and web-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Heat waves were defined as days with
  daily maximum values of each index at a specified threshold (literature-based, the
  90th and 95th percentiles) or above. Distributed lag non-linear models and meta-analysis
  were used to estimate risk of mortality and hospitalization for all-causes, cardiovascular
  causes, respiratory causes and heat disorders during heat wave days compared to
  non-heat wave days. WBGT identified 1.15 times longer maximum heat wave duration
  for the study periods than air temperature when the thresholds were based on 90th
  and 95th percentiles. Over the study period, for heat waves defined by WBGT and
  HI, the Southwestern region showed the highest total number of heat wave days, whereas
  for air temperature the longest heat wave days were identified in the southeastern
  region. The highest and most significant impact of heat waves were found by WBGT
  for hospitalization from heat disorders (Relative risk = 2.959, 95% CI: 1.566–5.594).
  In sensitivity analyses using different structure of lags and temperature metrics
  (e.g., daily mean and minimum), the impacts of heat waves on most health outcomes
  substantially increased by using WBGT for heat wave definitions. As a result, WBGT
  and its thresholds can be used to relate heat waves and heat-related diseases to
  improve the prevention effectiveness of heat wave warnings and give informative
  health guidelines according to the range of WBGT thresholds.'
