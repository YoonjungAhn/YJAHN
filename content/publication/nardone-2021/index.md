abstract: 'INTRODUCTION: Redlining, a racist mortgage appraisal practice of the 1930s,
  established and exacerbated racial residential segregation boundaries in the United
  States. Investment risk grades assigned >80 y ago through security maps from the
  Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) are associated with current sociodemographics
  and adverse health outcomes. We assessed whether historical HOLC investment grades
  are associated with 2010 greenspace, a health-promoting neighborhood resource. OBJECTIVES:
  We compared 2010 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) across previous HOLC
  neighborhood grades using propensity score restriction and matching. METHODS: Security
  map shapefiles were downloaded from the Mapping Inequality Project. Neighborhood
  investment risk grades included A (best, green), B (blue), C (yellow), and D (hazardous,
  red, i.e., redlined). We used 2010 satellite imagery to calculate the average NDVI
  for each HOLC neighborhood. Our main outcomes were 2010 annual average NDVI and
  summer NDVI. We assigned areal-apportioned 1940 census measures to each HOLC neighborhood.
  We used propensity score restriction, matching, and targeted maximum likelihood
  estimation to limit model extrapolation, reduce confounding, and estimate the association
  between HOLC grade and NDVI for the following comparisons: Grades B vs. A, C vs.
  B, and D vs. C. RESULTS: Across 102 urban areas (4,141 HOLC polygons), annual average
  ± standard deviation (SD) 2010 NDVI was 0.47 (± 0:09), 0.43 (± 0:09), 0.39 (± 0:09),
  and 0.36 (± 0:10) in Grades A–D, respectively. In analyses adjusted for current
  ecoregion and census region, 1940s census measures, and 1940s population density,
  annual average NDVI values in 2010 were estimated at −0:039 (95% CI: −0:045, −0:034),
  −0:024 (95% CI: −0:030, −0:018), and −0:026 (95% CI: −0:037, −0:015) for Grades
  B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C, respectively, in the 1930s. DISCUSSION: Estimates
  adjusted for historical characteristics indicate that neighborhoods assigned worse
  HOLC grades in the 1930s are associated with reduced present-day greenspace. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7495.'
