abstract: Individuals from different backgrounds, social groups, and countries enjoy
  different levels of health. This article defines and distinguishes between unavoidable
  health inequalities and unjust and preventable health inequities. We describe the
  dimensions along which health inequalities are commonly examined, including across
  the global population, between countries or states, and within geographies, by socially
  relevant groupings such as race/ethnicity, gender, education, caste, income, occupation,
  and more. Different theories attempt to explain group-level differences in health,
  including psychosocial, material deprivation, health behavior, environmental, and
  selection explanations. Concepts of relative versus absolute; dose-response versus
  threshold; composition versus context; place versus space; the life course perspective
  on health; causal pathways to health; conditional health effects; and group-level
  versus individual differences are vital in understanding health inequalities. We
  close by reflecting on what conditions make health inequalities unjust, and to consider
  the merits of policies that prioritize the elimination of health disparities versus
  those that focus on raising the overall standard of health in a population.
