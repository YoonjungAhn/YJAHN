abstract: Introduction This chapter examines what is known about the effects of climate
  change on human health and, briefly, the more direct impacts of climate-altering
  pollutants (CAPs; see Glossary) on health. We review diseases and other aspects
  of poor health that are sensitive to weather and climate. We examine the factors
  that influence the susceptibility of populations and individuals to ill health due
  to variations in weather and climate, and describe steps that may be taken to reduce
  the impacts of climate change on human health. The chapter also includes a section
  on health \"co-benefits.\" Co-benefits are positive effects on human health that
  arise from interventions to reduce emissions of those CAPs that warm the planet
  or vice versa. This is a scientific assessment based on best available evidence
  according to the judgment of the authors. We searched the English-language literature
  up to August 2013, focusing primarily on publications since 2007. We drew primarily
  (but not exclusively) on peer-reviewed journals. Literature was identified using
  a published protocol (Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012) and other approaches,
  including extensive consultation with technical experts in the field. We examined
  recent substantial reviews (e.g., Gosling et al., 2009; Bassil and Cole, 2010; Hajat
  et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; McMichael, 2013b; Stanke et al., 2013) to check
  for any omissions of important work. In selecting citations for the chapter, we
  gave priority to publications that were recent (since AR4), comprehensive, added
  significant new findings to the literature, and included areas or population groups
  that have not previously been well described or were judged to be particularly policy
  relevant in other respects. We begin with an outline of measures of human health,
  the major driving forces that act on health worldwide, recent trends in health status,
  and health projections for the remainder of the 21st century. 11.1.1. Present State
  of Global Health The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) pointed to dramatic improvement
  in life expectancy in most parts of the world in the 20th century, and this trend
  has continued through the first decade of the 21st century (Wang et al., 2012).
