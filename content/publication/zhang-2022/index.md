abstract: While clustering has been commonly used to profile the building electricity
  consumption data, its application to HVAC system data is relatively less. Based
  on the operation data of a residential ground source heat pump (GSHP) system, a
  pre-processing procedure was set up, including acquisition, cleaning, missing-data
  fill-in, and standardization. Then hierarchical clustering was used, based on the
  dynamic time warping (DTW) distance calculation method. A new index, the sum of
  squares of errors based on DTW, was used to determine the best cluster number. The
  patterns were extracted based on clustering results. The heat exchange on the user-side
  during one cooling season was processed as a case study. We obtained 5 valid clusters
  and extracted patterns from each. For the studied case, the result based on the
  DTW method yields a better homogeneity compared to the Euclidean method. The method
  is then applied to a five-year operation data, where 9 and 6 patterns were obtained
  for the cooling and heating seasons, respectively. They mainly differed in shape,
  and the cooling patterns fluctuate more. Overall, clustering and pattern extraction
  can reduce the data dimension, and provide a data-driven view of how the system
  supplies the cooling and heating.
