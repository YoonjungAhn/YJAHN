abstract: Household-level information on central (cenAC) and room (rmAC) air conditioning
  and cold- weather thermal comfort are often missing from publicly available housing
  databases hindering research and action on climate adaptation and air pollution
  exposure reduction. We modeled these using information from the American Housing
  Survey for 2003–2013 and 140 U.S. core-based statistical areas employing variables
  that would be present in publicly available parcel records. We present random-intercept
  logistic regression models with either cenAC, rmAC or “home was uncomfortably cold
  for 24 hours or more” (tooCold) as outcome variables and housing value, rented vs.
  owned, age, and multi- vs. single-family, each interacted with cooling- or heating-degree
  days as predictors. The out-of-sample predicted probabilities for years 2015–2017
  were compared to corresponding American Housing Survey values (0 or 1). Using a
  0.5 probability threshold, the model had 63% specificity (true negative rate), and
  91% sensitivity (true positive rate) for cenAC, while specificity and sensitivity
  for rmAC were 94% and 34%, respectively. Area-specific sensitivities and specificities
  varied widely. For tooCold, the overall sensitivity was effectively 0%. Future epidemiologic
  studies, heat vulnerability maps, and intervention screenings may reliably use these
  or similar AC models with parcel-level data to improve understanding of health risk
  and the spatial patterning of homes without AC.
