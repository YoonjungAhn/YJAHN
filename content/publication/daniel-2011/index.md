abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To characterize the trends, distribution, potential determinants
  and  public health implications of meat consumption within the USA. DESIGN: We examined
  temporal trends in meat consumption using food availability data from the FAO and
  US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and further evaluated the meat intake by type
  (red, white, processed) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
  (NHANES) linked to the MyPyramid Equivalents Database (MPED). RESULTS: Overall meat
  consumption has continued to rise in the USA and the rest of the developed world.
  Despite a shift towards higher poultry consumption, red meat still represents the
  largest proportion of meat consumed in the USA (58 %). Twenty-two per cent of the
  meat consumed in the USA is processed. According to the NHANES 2003-2004, total
  meat intake averaged 128 g/d. The type and quantities of meat reported varied by
  education, race, age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Given the plausible epidemiological
  evidence for red and processed meat intake in cancer and chronic disease risk, understanding
  the trends and determinants of meat consumption in the USA, where meat is consumed
  at more than three times the global average, should be particularly pertinent to
  researchers and other public health professionals aiming to reduce the global burden
  of chronic disease.'
