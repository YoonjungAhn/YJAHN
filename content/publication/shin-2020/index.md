abstract: The risk levels of heat-related extreme events need to be estimated for
  prediction and real-time monitoring to mitigate their impacts on air quality, public
  health, the ecosystem, and critical infrastructure. Many countries have adopted
  meteorological variable base thresholds for assessing the risk level of heat-related
  extreme events. These thresholds provide an approximate risk level for a specific
  event but do not consider its intensity and duration in the risk assessment. The
  current study provides a statistical tool to assess the risk of heat-related extreme
  events while concurrently considering their intensities and durations based on the
  wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). To this end, the intensity–duration–frequency
  (IDF) relationship of the extreme WBGT in South Korea was derived. Regional frequency
  analysis was employed to understand the IDF relationship. Return levels of heat-related
  extreme events in South Korea were calculated and their characteristics were investigated
  based on the annual maximum WBGT observations. The results showed that the IDF relationship
  could provide the risks of heat-related extreme events while concurrently considering
  their intensities and durations. The extreme WBGT in South Korea was used to categorize
  two regions such as coastal and inland based on their statistical characteristics.
  The return levels of the annual maximum WBGT events were found to vary largely by
  location. The return levels corresponding to 32 °C with 3-h duration for stations
  in the coastal and inland regions ranged from 1- to 100-years and 3- to 1000-years,
  respectively. Mean values of return levels for heatwave events in Seoul, Incheon,
  Daejon, Gwangju, Daegu, and Busan were 2.8-, 8.4-, 15.3-, 2.8-, 1.6-, and 2.2-years,
  respectively. The return levels of heatwaves for the warmer cities are smaller than
  those for cooler cities. The return levels of the heatwave events in South Korea
  showed a significant increasing trend in several cities, supporting the notion that
  the impact of heatwave events on South Korea might become more severe in the future.
