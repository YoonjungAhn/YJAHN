abstract: In an extreme heat event, people can go to air-conditioned public facilities
  if residential airconditioning is not available. Residences that heat slowly may
  also mitigate health effects, particularly in neighborhoods with social vulnerability.
  We explored the contributions of social vulnerability and these infra-structures
  to heat mortality in Maricopa County and whether these relationships are sensitive
  to temperature. Using Poisson regression modeling with heat-related mortality as
  the outcome, we assessed the interaction of increasing temperature with social vulnerability,
  access to publicly available air conditioned space, home air conditioning and the
  thermal properties of residences. As temperatures increase, mortality from heat-related
  illness increases less in census tracts with more publicly accessible cooled spaces.
  Mortality from all internal causes of death did not have this association. Building
  thermal protection was not associated with mortality. Social vulnerability was still
  associated with mortality after adjusting for the infrastructure variables. To reduce
  heat-related mortality, the use of public cooled spaces might be expanded to target
  the most vulnerable.
