abstract: Extreme heat is already occurring more frequently and with greater intensity,
  with this trend predicted to continue. Exposure to extreme heat causes labor supply
  declines, but studies to quantify the economic effects from future climate changes
  are limited. In this study, we adopt two different exposure-response functions relating
  extreme heat to the loss of labor working minutes or labor productivity. We estimate
  that temperature differences between 2006 and 2016 relative to 1980–1990 led to
  labor losses of ~$1.7 billion annually in the USA. Under the high emissions RCP8.5
  scenario, approximately 1–1.8 billion workforce hours will be lost annually in the
  2050s, and 1.5–4.4 billion hours will be lost by the 2100s, depending on the exposure-response
  function used. The lost hours lead to an estimated $51–119 billion in losses by
  the 2100s, without considering future climate adaptation, demographic, employment,
  wage structure, or economic changes. Whereas 2006–2016 losses correspond to 0.07%
  of the 2016 GDP, the 2100s losses rise roughly fourfold to 0.3%, which are mainly
  caused by the increases of extreme heat conditions with population growth a secondary
  factor. With the climate change mitigation strategies of the RCP4.5 scenario, 600–2600
  million hours of lost labor per year could be avoided in the 2100s, saving $20–78
  billion depending on the chosen exposure-response function. We also evaluated the
  effect of decarbonizing the energy sector in a manner consistent with the 1.5 °C
  target of the Paris Agreement, finding that these lead to ~77 million avoided lost
  work hours worth ~$2.5 billion annually by the 2050s with global collaboration but
  insignificant impacts with US action alone. Though uncertainties and limitations
  exist in the study, we find that extreme heat will cause large economic losses to
  US businesses, especially in southern states (from California to Florida), though
  widespread climate change mitigation has the potential to substantially reduce these
  losses. We find that uncertainties among the exposure-response functions used to
  derive the economic effects of extreme heat on labor are much larger than those
  from the climate models. Previous studies using only one exposure-response function
  may exhibit substantial biases and likely underestimate uncertainties associated
  with the effect of climate changes on labor.
