abstract: 'Research Highlights: This paper presents a cross-city empirical study on
  micro-climatic thermal benefits of urban trees, using machine-learning analysis
  to identify the importance of several in situ measured tree physiognomy traits for
  cooling. Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular
  play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed
  understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is
  necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot
  cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various
  tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air
  temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature
  of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling
  effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height,
  crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI)
  and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities
  of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European
  cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species,
  height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence
  on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable
  indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly
  robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning
  and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem
  services.'
