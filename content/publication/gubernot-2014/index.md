abstract: In recent years, the United States has experienced record-breaking summer
  heat. Climate change models forecast increasing US temperatures and more frequent
  heat wave events in the coming years. Exposure to environmental heat is a significant,
  but overlooked, workplace hazard that has not been well-characterized or studied.
  The working population is diverse; job function, age, fitness level, and risk factors
  to heat-related illnesses vary. Yet few studies have examined or characterized the
  incidence of occupational heat-related morbidity and mortality. There are no federal
  regulatory standards to protect workers from environmental heat exposure. With climate
  change as a driver for adaptation and prevention of heat disorders, crafting policy
  to characterize and prevent occupational heat stress for both indoor and outdoor
  workers is increasingly sensible, practical, and imperative.
