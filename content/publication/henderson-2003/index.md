abstract: There is an extensive literature on the urbanization process looking at
  both urbanization and urban concentration, asking whether and when there is under
  or over-urbanization or under or over urban concentration. Writers argue that national
  government policies and non-democratic institutions promote excessive concentration
  - the extent to which the urban population of a country is concentrated in one or
  two major metropolitan areas - except in former planned economies where migration
  restrictions are enforced. These literatures assume that there is an optimal level
  of urbanization or an optimal level of urban concentration, but no research to date
  has quantitatively examined the assumption and asked the basic \"so-what\" question
  - how great are the economic losses from significant deviations from any optimal
  degrees of urban concentration or rates of urbanization? This paper shows that (1)
  there is a best degree of urban concentration, in terms of maximizing productivity
  growth (2) that best degree varies with the level of development and country size,
  and (3) over or under-concentration can be very costly in terms of productivity
  growth. The paper shows also that productivity growth is not strongly affected by
  urbanization per se. Rapid urbanization has often occurred in the face of low or
  negative economic growth over some decades. Moreover, urbanization is a transitory
  phenomenon where many countries are now fully urbanized. Â© 2003 Kluwer Academic
