abstract: This paper discusses the importance of determining an accurate depiction
  of total population and specific sub-population distribution for urban areas in
  order to develop an improved \"denominator,\" which would enable the calculation
  of more correct rates in GIS analyses involving public health, crime, and urban
  environmental planning. Rather than using data aggregated by arbitrary administrative
  boundaries such as census tracts, we use dasymetric mapping, an areal interpolation
  method using ancillary information to delineate areas of homogeneous values. We
  review previous dasymetric mapping techniques (which often use remotely sensed land-cover
  data) and contrast them with our technique, Cadastral-based Expert Dasymetric System
  (CEDS), which is particularly suitable for urban areas. The CEDS method uses specific
  cadastral data, land-use filters, modeling by expert system routines, and validation
  against various census enumeration units and other data. The CEDS dasymetric mapping
  technique is presented through a case study of asthma hospitalizations in the Bronx,
  New York City, in relation to proximity buffers constructed around major sources
  of air pollution. The case study shows the impact that a more accurate estimation
  of population distribution has on a current environmental justice and health disparities
  research project, and the potential of CEDS for other GIS applications.
