abstract: A method for generating daily surfaces of temperature., precipitation, humidity,
  and radiation over large regions of complex terrain is presented. Required inputs
  include digital elevation data and observations of maximum temperature, minimum
  temperature and precipitation from ground-based meteorological stations. Our method
  is based on the spatial convolution of a truncated Gaussian weighting filter with
  the set of station locations. Sensitivity to the typical heterogeneous distribution
  of stations in complex terrain is accomplished with an iterative station density
  algorithm. Spatially and temporally explicit empirical analyses of the relationships
  of temperature and precipitation to elevation were performed, and the characteristic
  spatial and temporal scales of these relationships were explored. A daily precipitation
  occurrence algorithm is introduced, as a precursor to the prediction of daily precipitation
  amount. Surfaces of humidity (vapor pressure deficit) are generated as a function
  of the predicted daily minimum temperature and the predicted daily average daylight
  temperature. Daily surfaces of incident solar radiation are generated as a function
  of Sun-slope geometry and interpolated diurnal temperature range. The application
  of these methods is demonstrated over an area of approximately 400 000 km' in the
  northwestern USA, for 1 year, including a detailed illustration of the parameterization
  process. A cross-validation analysis was performed, comparing predicted and observed
  daily and annual average values. Mean absolute errors (MAR) for predicted annual
  average maximum and minimum temperature were 0.7X! and 1.2\"C, with biases of +O.l\"C
  and-O.l\"C, respectively. MAR for predicted annual total precipitation was 13.4
  cm, or, expressed as a percentage of the observed annual totals, 19.3%. The success
  rate for predictions of daily precipitation occurrence was 83.3%. Particular attention
  was given to the predicted and observed relationships between precipitation frequency
  and intensity, and they were shown to be similar. We tested the sensitivity of these
  methods to prediction grid-point spacing, and found that areal averages were unchanged
  for grids ranging in spacing from 500 m to 32 km. We tested the dependence of the
  results on timestep, and found that the temperature prediction algorithms scale
  perfectly in this respect. Temporal scaling of precipitation predictions was complicated
  by the daily
