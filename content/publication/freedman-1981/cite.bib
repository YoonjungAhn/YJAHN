 abstract = {Bootstrapping is a nonparametric approach to statistical inference that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional assumptions and asymptotic results. 1 Bootstrapping offers a number of advantages: • The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails. • Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small. • It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difﬁcult to derive, even asymptotically. • It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratiﬁed and clustered samples).},
