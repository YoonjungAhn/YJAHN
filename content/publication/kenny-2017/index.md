abstract: We examined whether older individuals experience greater levels of hyperthermia
  and cardiovascular strain during an extreme heat exposure compared to young adults.
  During a 3-hour extreme heat exposure (44°C, 30% relative humidity), we compared
  body heat storage, core temperature (rectal, visceral) and cardiovascular (heart
  rate, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, limb blood flow) responses of young
  adults (n = 30, 19–28 years) against those of older adults (n = 30, 55–73 years).
  Direct calorimetry measured whole-body evaporative and dry heat exchange. Body heat
  storage was calculated as the temporal summation of heat production (indirect calorimetry)
  and whole-body heat loss (direct calorimetry) over the exposure period. While both
  groups gained a similar amount of heat in the first hour, the older adults showed
  an attenuated increase in evaporative heat loss (p < 0.033) in the first 30-min.
  Thereafter, the older adults were unable to compensate for a greater rate of heat
  gain (11 ± 1; p < 0.05) with a corresponding increase in evaporative heat loss.
  Older adults stored more heat (358 ± 173 kJ) relative to their younger (202 ± 92 kJ;
  p < 0.001) counterparts at the end of the exposure leading to greater elevations
  in rectal (p = 0.043) and visceral (p = 0.05) temperatures, albeit not clinically
  significant (rise < 0.5°C). Older adults experienced a reduction in calf blood flow
  (p < 0.01) with heat stress, yet no differences in cardiac output, blood pressure
  or heart rate. We conclude, in healthy habitually active individuals, despite no
  clinically observable cardiovascular or temperature changes, older adults experience
  greater heat gain and decreased limb perfusion in response to 3-hour heat exposure.
