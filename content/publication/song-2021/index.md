abstract: 'The relationship between diabetes mellitus and short-term exposure to extreme
  temperatures remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed
  to assess the association between extreme temperatures and diabetes mellitus morbidity
  and mortality. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Cumulative
  Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched since inception
  to January 1, 2019, and updated on November 17, 2020. The results were combined
  using random effects model and reported as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence
  interval (CI). In total, 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. (1) Both heat and
  cold exposures have impact on diabetes. (2) For heat exposure, the subgroup analysis
  revealed that the effect on diabetes mortality (RR=1.139, 95% CI: 1.089–1.192) was
  higher than morbidity (RR=1.012, 95% CI: 1.004–1.019). (3) With the increase of
  definition threshold, the impact of heat exposure on diabetes rose. (4) A stronger
  association between heat exposure and diabetes was observed in the elderly (≥ 60
  years old) (RR=1.040, 95% CI: 1.017–1.064). In conclusion, short-term exposure to
  both heat and cold temperatures has impact on diabetes. The elderly is the vulnerable
  population of diabetes exposure to heat temperature. Developing definitions of heatwaves
  at the regional level are suggested.'
