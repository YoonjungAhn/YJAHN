abstract: CONTEXT Recommendations for heat illness prevention provided by sports medicine
  associations do not always account for sex differences, specific age populations,
  regional environmental conditions, equipment worn during activity, or the athlete's
  size or preexisting level of fitness. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the rate of exertional
  heat illness (EHI) among collegiate football athletes and to monitor environmental
  conditions during American football practice for a 3-month period. DESIGN Epidemiologic
  study in which we reviewed the occurrence rates of EHI and wet bulb globe temperature
  readings during a 3-month period of American collegiate football practice sessions.
  SETTING Five universities in the southeastern region of the United States. PATIENTS
  OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Collegiate football players at the 5 universities. MAIN OUTCOME
  MEASURE(S) Wet bulb globe temperatures were recorded from August through October
  2003, at the beginning, middle, and end of each practice session. The EHIs were
  identified and recorded, and athlete-exposures (AEs) were calculated. RESULTS A
  total of 139 EHIs and 33 196 AEs were reported (EHI rate = 4.19/1000 AEs). The highest
  incidence of EHIs was in August (88%, EHI rate = 8.95/1000 AEs) and consisted of
  70% heat cramps (6.13/1000 AEs), 23% heat exhaustion (2.06/ 1000 AEs), and 7% heat
  syncope (0.58/1000 AEs). No cases of heat stroke or hyponatremia were identified.
  The highest risk of EHI occurred during the first 3 weeks of the study; mean wet
  bulb globe temperature declined significantly as the study continued ( P < .001).
  Temperatures in the final 5 weeks of the study were significantly cooler than in
  the first 5 weeks ( P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Heat cramps were the most common EHI and
  occurred most often during the first 3 weeks of practice. Athletic trainers should
  take all necessary preventive measures to reduce the risk of EHI.
