abstract: Background As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme
  heat events researchers and public health officials must work towards understanding
  the causes and outcomes of heat-related morbidity and mortality. While there have
  been many studies on both heatrelated illness (HRI), there are fewer on heat-related
  morbidity than on heatrelated mortality. Objective To identify individual and environmental
  risk factors for hospitalizations and document patterns of household cooling. Methods
  We performed a pooled cross-sectional analysis of secondary U.S. data, the Nationwide
  Inpatient Sample. Risk ratios were calculated from multivariable models to identify
  risk factors for hospitalizations. Hierarchical modeling was also employed to identify
  relationships between individual and hospital level predictors of hospitalizations.
  Patterns of air conditioning use were analyzed among the vulnerable populations
  identified. Results Hospitalizations due to HRI increased over the study period
  compared to all other hospitalizations. Populations at elevated risk for HRI hospitalization
  were blacks, males and all age groups above the age of 40. Those living in zip-codes
  in the lowest income quartile and the uninsured were also at an increased risk.
  Hospitalizations for HRI in rural and small urban clusters were elevated, compared
  to urban areas. Conclusions Risk factors for HRI include age greater than 40, male
  gender and hospitalization in rural areas or small urban clusters. Our analysis
  also revealed an increasing pattern of HRI hospitalizations over time and decreased
  association between common comorbidities and heat illnesses which may be indicative
  of underreporting.
