abstract: 'Introduction: With climate change, there has been an increase in the frequency,
  intensity and duration of heatwave events. In response to the devastating mortality
  and morbidity of recent heatwave events, many countries have introduced heatwave
  early warning systems (HEWS). HEWS are designed to reduce the avoidable human health
  consequences of heatwaves through timely notification of prevention measures to
  vulnerable populations. Objective: To identify the key characteristics of HEWS in
  European countries to help inform modification of current, and development of, new
  systems and plans. Methods: We searched the internet to identify HEWS policy or
  government documents for 33 European countries and requested information from relevant
  organizations. We translated the HEWS documents and extracted details on the trigger
  indicators, thresholds for action, notification strategies, message intermediaries,
  communication and dissemination strategies, prevention strategies recommended and
  specified target audiences. Findings and Conclusions: Twelve European countries
  have HEWS. Although there are many similarities among the HEWS, there also are differences
  in key characteristics that could inform improvements in heatwave early warning
  plans. Â© 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.'
