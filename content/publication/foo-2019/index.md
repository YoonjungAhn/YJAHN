abstract: Coral reefs face an uncertain future and may not recover naturally from
  anthropogenic climate change. Coral restoration is needed to rehabilitate degraded
  reefs and to sustain biodiversity. There is a need for baseline data on global reef
  distribution, composition, and condition to provide targets for conservation and
  restoration. Remote sensing can address this issue and is currently underutilized
  in reef research and restoration. This synthesis integrates current capabilities
  of remote sensing with key reef restoration criteria, to facilitate coral restoration
  success. Research into the development of a spectral database for corals, linking
  habitat type and extent with predator abundance, and identification of species-specific
  acoustic signatures are needed to advance the use of remote sensing in reef restoration
  design and monitoring. Reciprocally, reef restoration efforts should innovate at
  ecosystem, regional, and global levels using remote sensing, to preserve as much
  of the coral reef biome as possible with continued ocean-climate change.
