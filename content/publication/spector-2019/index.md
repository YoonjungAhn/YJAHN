abstract: The burden of heat-related adverse occupational health effects, as well
  as traumatic injuries, is already substantial. Projected increases in mean temperatures
  and extreme events may increase the risk of adverse heat health effects and enhance
  disparities among exposed workers. This article reviews the emerging literature
  on the relationship between heat exposure and occupational traumatic injuries and
  discusses implications of this work. A recent meta-analysis of three case-crossover
  and five time series studies in industrialized settings reported an association
  of increasing occupational injuries with increasing heat exposure, with increased
  effect estimates for male gender and age less than 25&nbsp;years, although heterogeneity
  in exposure metrics and sources of bias were demonstrated to varying degrees across
  studies. A subsequent case-crossover study in outdoor construction workers reported
  a 0.5% increase in the odds of traumatic injuries per 1&nbsp;°C increase in maximum
  daily humidex (odds ratio 1.005 [95% CI 1.003–1.007]). While some studies have demonstrated
  reversed U-shaped associations between heat exposure and occupational injuries,
  different risk profiles have been reported in different industries and settings.
  Studies conducted primarily in industrialized settings suggest an increased risk
  of traumatic injury with increasing heat exposure, though the exact mechanisms of
  heat exposure’s effects on traumatic injuries are still under investigation. The
  effectiveness of heat-related injury prevention approaches has not yet been established.
  To enhance the effectiveness of prevention efforts, prioritization of approaches
  should take into account not only the hierarchy of controls, social-ecological models,
  community and stakeholder participation, and tailoring of approaches to specific
  local work settings, but also methods that reduce local and global disparities and
  better address the source of heat exposure, including conservation-informed land-use
  planning, built environment, and prevention through design approaches. Participation
  of occupational health experts in transdisciplinary development and integration
  of these approaches is needed.
