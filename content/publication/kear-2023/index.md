abstract: 'A R T I C L E I N F O Keywords: Home thermal security, energy poverty Energy
  equity Extreme heat Manufactured housing Climate change A B S T R A C T This article
  contributes to theoretical understandings of the relationships among extreme heat
  vulnerability, energy equity and home thermal security (HTS)-the ability to maintain
  a home thermal environment consistent with basic health, social and financial needs.
  Based on three years of mixed-methods qualitative research among social service
  practitioners, landlords and residents of mobile and manufactured housing (MH) communities,
  we argue that thermal insecurity is a socially produced, rather than intrinsic,
  feature of MH. We use the thermal struggles of MH residents to illustrate how gaps
  in research, markets, landlord-tenant law, policy, and specific government programs
  overlap to produce MH as a site of hyper-exclusion from many tools used to mitigate
  and adapt to climate risk. We find that most MH residents, despite barriers and
  a warming climate, are able to maintain some level of HTS. We highlight the small-scale,
  improvisational strategies that households use to cope and adapt to the extreme
  temperatures. HTS is an achievement sustained by a variety of elements that cannot
  be reduced to simple metrics (e.g., presence of air conditioning). We conclude with
  a practical set of policy recommendations as well as a call for an expansive \"climate
  finance\" that includes the improvisational practices of excluded groups as innovations
  worth learning from and investing in.'
