abstract: Despite abundant data on the spatial distribution of contemporary human
  settlements, historical data on the long-term evolution of human settlements at
  fine spatial and temporal granularity is scarce, limiting our quantitative understanding
  of long-term changes of built-up areas. This is because commonly used mapping methods
  (e.g., computer vision) and suitable data sources (i.e., aerial imagery, multi-spectral
  remote sensing data, LiDAR) have only been available in recent decades. However,
  there are alternative data sources such as cadastral records that are digitally
  available, containing relevant information such as building age information, allowing
  for an approximate, digital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted
  a non-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from administrative
  institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and harmonized cadastral
  parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint data for 33 counties, wherever
  building footprint geometries and building construction year information was available.
  The result of this effort is a unique dataset that we call the Multi-Temporal Building
  Footprint Dataset for 33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million
  building footprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive
  retrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial and
  temporal grain and can be used for data validation purposes, or to train statistical
  learning approaches aiming to extract historical information on human settlements
  from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data sources.
