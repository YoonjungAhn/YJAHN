abstract: We present a set of indicators of vulnerability and capacity to adapt to
  climate variability, and by extension climate change, derived using a novel empirical
  analysis of data aggregated at the national level on a decadal timescale. The analysis
  is based on a conceptual framework in which risk is viewed in terms of outcome,
  and is a function of physically defined climate hazards and socially constructed
  vulnerability. Climate outcomes are represented by mortality from climate-related
  disasters, using the emergency events database data set, statistical relationships
  between mortality and a shortlist of potential proxies for vulnerability are used
  to identify key vulnerability indicators. We find that 11 key indicators exhibit
  a strong relationship with decadally aggregated mortality associated with climate-related
  disasters. Validation of indicators, relationships between vulnerability and adaptive
  capacity, and the sensitivity of subsequent vulnerability assessments to different
  sets of weightings are explored using expert judgement data, collected through a
  focus group exercise. The data are used to provide a robust assessment of vulnerability
  to climate-related mortality at the national level, and represent an entry point
  to more detailed explorations of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. They indicate
  that the most vulnerable nations are those situated in sub-Saharan Africa and those
  that have recently experienced conflict. Adaptive capacity - one element of vulnerability
  - is associated predominantly with governance, civil and political rights, and literacy.
