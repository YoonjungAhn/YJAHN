abstract: <p>Noise is one of the most frequent complaints and represents a public
  health hazard. While traffic-related noise has been studied extensively, research
  on construction noise has been lacking. In this study, we examined the relationship
  between construction activities and noise annoyance and tested whether this relationship
  is stronger after working hours. Data were drawn from a historical inventory of
  major development projects and crowdsourced citizen complaints data (311 calls)
  in Vancouver, Canada from 2011 to 2016. Mixed effects models were developed with
  an interaction between construction activities and after-hours report. Results show
  that neighborhood noise complaints were significantly associated with major constructions
  (IRR = 1.062, 95% CI = 1.024–1.097). A significant interaction effect was also found
  between construction activities and after-hours reporting (IRR = 1.050 CI = 1.012–1.087).
  To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically show the adverse
  effects of urban development on noise annoyance. The results imply that existing
  noise bylaws may not be effective in restricting construction activities at night
  and during sleeping hours, which may cause adverse health effects.</p>
