abstract: Heat waves and air pollution episodes pose a serious threat to human health
  and may worsen under future climate change. In this paper, we use 15 years (1999-2013)
  of commensurately gridded (1° × 1°) surface observations of extended summer (April-September)
  surface ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and maximum temperature (TX)
  over the eastern United States and Canada to construct a climatology of the coincidence,
  overlap, and lag in space and time of their extremes. Extremes of each quantity
  are defined climatologically at each grid cell as the 50 d with the highest values
  in three 5-y windows (∼95th percentile). Any two extremes occur on the same day
  in the same grid cell more than 50% of the time in the northeastern United States,
  but on a domain average, co-occurrence is approximately 30%. Although not exactly
  co-occurring, many of these extremes show connectedness with consistent offsets
  in space and in time, which often defy traditional mechanistic explanations. All
  three extremes occur primarily in large-scale, multiday, spatially connected episodes
  with scales of >1,000 km and clearly coincide with large-scale meteorological features.
  The largest, longest-lived episodes have the highest incidence of co-occurrence
  and contain extreme values well above their local 95th percentile threshold, by
  +7 ppb for O3, +6 μg m-3 for PM2.5, and +1.7 °C for TX. Our results demonstrate
  the need to evaluate these extremes as synergistic costressors to accurately quantify
  their impacts on human health.
