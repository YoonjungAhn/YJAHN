abstract: "Fostering resilience in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political
  uncertainty and risk has captured the attention of academics and decision makers
  across disciplines, sectors, and scales. Resilience has become an important goal
  for cities, particularly in the face of climate change. Urban areas house the majority
  of the world's population, and, in addition to functioning as nodes of resource
  consumption and as sites for innovation, have become laboratories for resilience,
  both in theory and in practice. This paper reviews the scholarly literature on urban
  resilience and concludes that the term has not been well defined. Existing definitions
  are inconsistent and underdeveloped with respect to incorporation of crucial concepts
  found in both resilience theory and urban theory. Based on this literature review,
  and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper identifies six conceptual tensions
  fundamental to urban resilience: (1) definition of 'urban'; (2) understanding of
  system equilibrium; (3) positive vs. neutral (or negative) conceptualizations of
  resilience; (4) mechanisms for system change; (5) adaptation versus general adaptability;
  and (6) timescale of action. To advance this burgeoning field, more conceptual clarity
  is needed. This paper, therefore, proposes a new definition of urban resilience.
  This definition takes explicit positions on these tensions, but remains inclusive
  and flexible enough to enable uptake by, and collaboration among, varying disciplines.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of how the definition might serve as a boundary
  object, with the acknowledgement that applying resilience in different contexts
  requires answering: Resilience for whom and to what? When? Where? And why?."
