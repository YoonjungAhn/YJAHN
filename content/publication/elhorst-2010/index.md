abstract: "This paper places the key issues and implications of the new 'introductory'
  book on spatial econometrics by James LeSage & Kelley Pace (2009) in a broader perspective:
  the argument in favour of the spatial Durbin model, the use of indirect effects
  as a more valid basis for testing whether spatial spillovers are significant, the
  use of Bayesian posterior model probabilities to determine which spatial weights
  matrix best describes the data, and the book's contribution to the literature on
  spatiotemporal models. The main conclusion is that the state of the art of applied
  spatial econometrics has taken a step change with the publication of this book.
