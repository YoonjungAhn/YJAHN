abstract: Identifying the locations and footprints of buildings is vital for many
  practical and scientific purposes. Such information can be particularly useful in
  developing regions where alternative data sources may be scarce. In this work, we
  describe a model training pipeline for detecting buildings across the entire continent
  of Africa, using 50 cm satellite imagery. Starting with the U-Net model, widely
  used in satellite image analysis, we study variations in architecture, loss functions,
  regularization, pre-training, self-training and post-processing that increase instance
  segmentation performance. Experiments were carried out using a dataset of 100k satellite
  images across Africa containing 1.75M manually labelled building instances, and
  further datasets for pre-training and self-training. We report novel methods for
  improving performance of building detection with this type of model, including the
  use of mixup (mAP +0.12) and self-training with soft KL loss (mAP +0.06). The resulting
  pipeline obtains good results even on a wide variety of challenging rural and urban
  contexts, and was used to create the Open Buildings dataset of 516M Africa-wide
  detected footprints.
