abstract: Background Prior research shows that work in agriculture and construction/extraction
  occupations increases the risk of environmental heat-associated death.  Purpose
  To assess the risk of environmental heat-associated death by occupation.  Methods
  This was a case-control study. Cases were heat-caused and heat-related deaths occurring
  from May-October during the period 2002â€“2009 in Maricopa County, Arizona. Controls
  were selected at random from non-heat-associated deaths during the same period in
  Maricopa County. Information on occupation, age, sex, and race-ethnicity was obtained
  from death certificates. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds
  ratios for heat-associated death.  Results There were 444 cases of heat-associated
  deaths in adults (18+ years) and 925 adult controls. Of heat-associated deaths,
  332 (75%) occurred in men; a construction/extraction or agriculture occupation was
  described on the death certificate in 115 (35%) of these men. In men, the age-adjusted
  odds ratios for heat-associated death were 2.32 (95% confidence interval 1.55, 3.48)
  in association with construction/extraction and 3.50 (95% confidence interval 1.94,
  6.32) in association with agriculture occupations. The odds ratio for heat-associated
  death was 10.17 (95% confidence interval 5.38, 19.23) in men with unknown occupation.
  In women, the age-adjusted odds ratio for heat-associated death was 6.32 (95% confidence
  interval 1.48, 27.08) in association with unknown occupation. Men age 65 years and
  older in agriculture occupations were at especially high risk of heat-associated
  death.  Conclusion The occurrence of environmental heat-associated death in men
  in agriculture and construction/extraction occupations in a setting with predictable
  periods of high summer temperatures presents opportunities for prevention.
