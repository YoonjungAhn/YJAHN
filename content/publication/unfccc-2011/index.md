abstract: As shown in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental
  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global climate is changing at rates unprecedented
  in recent human history and will continue to change. The associated climate change
  impacts and risks are global in their nature, geographically diverse and are increasingly
  being felt and recorded across a range of regions, communities and ecosystems. Current
  and projected climate change will exhibit impacts on numerous systems and sectors
  that are essential for human livelihoods. An increasing number of countries, regions
  and communities are embarking on adaptation activities. This strengthened demand
  for adaptation efforts necessitates access to a range of robust and transparent
  assessment approaches to enable decision makers to efficiently allocate scarce resources.
  For adaptation to be successful, it should ideally be undertaken within a comprehensive
  and iterative process of social, institutional and organizational learning and change.
  Assessing the costs and benefits of adaptation options is an important part of this
  process, assisting adaptation planners and practitioners to identify the most appropriate
  interventions for reducing vulnerability, enhancing adaptive capacity and building
  resilience.
