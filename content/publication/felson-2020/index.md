abstract: 'The spread of the coronavirus has led to containment policies in many places,
  with concomitant shifts in routine activities. Major declines in crime have been
  reported as a result. However, those declines depend on crime type and may differ
  by parts of a city and land uses. This paper examines burglary in Detroit, Michigan
  during the month of March, 2020, a period of considerable change in routine activities.
  We examine 879 block groups, separating those dominated by residential land use
  from those with more mixed land use. We divide the month into three periods: pre-containment,
  transition period, and post-containment. Burglaries increase in block groups with
  mixed land use, but not blocks dominated by residential land use. The impact of
  containment policies on burglary clarifies after taking land use into account.'
