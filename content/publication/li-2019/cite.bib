 abstract = {An accurate estimation of PM 2.5 (fine particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 μm) concentration is critical for health risk assessment and generating air pollution control strategies. In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach, named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM 2.5 concentrations, which integrates Random Forest (RF), one of machine learning (ML) models, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), one of remote sensing (RS) products. The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization of real-time spatiotemporal PM 2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships among a large number of meteorological, environmental and air pollutant factors, as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) during 2015–2017. Deep Blue (DB) AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 (C_61) aerosol products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is validated with Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM 2.5 concentrations. It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM 2.5 and relevant factors such as DB AOD, meteorological and air pollutant variables, but also can provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during haze periods.},
