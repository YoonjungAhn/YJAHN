abstract: An accurate estimation of PM 2.5 (fine particulate matters with diameters
  ≤ 2.5 μm) concentration is critical for health risk assessment and generating air
  pollution control strategies. In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and machine
  learning approach, named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM
  2.5 concentrations, which integrates Random Forest (RF), one of machine learning
  (ML) models, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), one of remote sensing (RS) products.
  The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization
  of real-time spatiotemporal PM 2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex
  surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships
  among a large number of meteorological, environmental and air pollutant factors,
  as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed
  RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) during 2015–2017.
  Deep Blue (DB) AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 (C_61) aerosol products of
  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is validated with Aerosol
  Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation
  with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well
  in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM 2.5 concentrations.
  It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM 2.5 and relevant
  factors such as DB AOD, meteorological and air pollutant variables, but also can
  provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during
  haze periods.
