abstract: 'Residential environments are known to contribute to asthma. To examine
  the joint impacts of exposures to residential indoor and outdoor air pollutants
  and housing risk factors on adult asthma-related health outcomes. We analyzed &gt;1-year
  of data from 53 participants from 41 homes in the pre-intervention period of the
  Breathe Easy Project prior to ventilation and filtration retrofits. Health outcomes
  included surveys of asthma control, health-related quality of life, stress, and
  healthcare utilizations. Environmental assessments included quarterly measurements
  of indoor and outdoor pollutants (e.g., HCHO, CO, CO2, NO2, O3, and PM), home walk-throughs,
  and surveys of environmental risk factors. Indoor pollutant concentrations were
  also matched with surveys of time spent at home to estimate indoor pollutant exposures.
  Cross-sectional analyses using mixed-effects models indicated that lower annual
  average asthma control test (ACT) scores were associated (p &lt; 0.05) with higher
  indoor NO2 (concentration/exposure: β = −2.42/−1.57), indoor temperature (β = −1.03
  to −0.94), and mold/dampness (β = −3.09 to −2.41). In longitudinal analysis, lower
  ACT scores were also associated (p &lt; 0.05) with higher indoor NO2 concentrations
  (β = −0.29), PM1 (concentration/exposure: β = −0.12/−0.24), PM2.5 (concentration/exposure:
  β = −0.12/−0.26), and PM10 (concentration/exposure: β = 10.14/-0.28). Emergency
  department visits were associated with poorer asthma control [incidence rate ratio
  (IRR) = 0.84; p &lt; 0.001], physical health (IRR = 0.95; p &lt; 0.05), mental health
  (IRR = 0.95; p &lt; 0.05), higher I/O NO2 ratios (IRR = 1.30; p &lt; 0.05), and
  higher indoor temperatures (IRR = 1.41; p &lt; 0.05). Findings suggest that residential
  risk factors, including indoor air pollution (especially NO2 and particulate matter),
  higher indoor temperature, and mold/dampness, may contribute to poorer asthma control.
  This study highlights the importance of residential indoor air quality and environmental
  risk factors for asthma control, health-related quality of life, and emergency department
  visits for asthma. Two timescales of mixed models suggest that exposure to indoor
  NO2 and particulate matter, higher indoor temperature, and mold/dampness was associated
  with poorer asthma control. Additionally, emergency department visits were associated
  with poorer asthma control and health-related quality of life, as well as higher
  I/O NO2 ratios and indoor temperatures. These findings deepen our understanding
  of the interrelationships between housing, air quality, and health, and have important
  implications for programs and policy.'
