abstract: To date, V ud of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix is most
  pre- cisely determined from superallowed 0 + ! 0 + nuclear -decays. In addition
  to half-life, Branching Ratio, and transition energy (called Q EC -value) of a superal-
  lowed decay, theoretical corrections have to be considered to extract V ud . Among
  those, the isospin symmetry breaking corrections, C , show discrepancies between
  different theoretical models, which are critical to be resolved. 74 Rb has the largest
  C of all 13 superallowed -emitters used to obtain V ud and would carry particular
  weight to discriminate between models were it not limited by the uncertainty in
  the Q EC -value. However, 74 Rbâ€™s half-life of 65 ms has previously posed a real
  challenge to the experimental precision in its Q EC -value, which is best determined
  by direct mass measurements in Penning traps. In this work, Penning trap mass measurements
  of short-lived nuclides have been performed for the first time with highly-charged
  ions, using the TITAN facility. Compared to singly-charged ions, this provides an
  improvement in experimental precision that scales with the charge state q . Neutron-deficient
  Rb-isotopes have been prepared in an electron beam ion trap to q = 8
