abstract: 'Problem, research strategy, and findings: In this morphological study I
  identify and measure recent nationwide trends in American street network design.
  Historically, orthogonal street grids provided the interconnectivity and density
  that researchers identify as important factors for reducing vehicular travel and
  emissions and increasing road safety and physical activity. During the 20th century,
  griddedness declined in planning practice along with declines in urban form compactness,
  density, and connectivity as urbanization sprawled around automobile dependence.
  But less is known about comprehensive empirical trends across U.S. neighborhoods,
  especially in recent years. Here I use public and open data to examine tract-level
  street networks across the entire United States. I develop theoretical and measurement
  frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. I measure
  how griddedness, orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections, and intersection
  density declined from 1940 through the 1990s, while dead-ends and block lengths
  increased. However, since 2000, these trends have rebounded, shifting back toward
  historical design patterns. Despite this rebound, when controlling for topography
  and built environment factors, all decades after 1939 are associated with lower
  griddedness than pre-1940 decades. Higher griddedness is associated with less car
  ownership—which itself has a well-established relationship with vehicle kilometers
  traveled and greenhouse gas emissions—while controlling for density, home and household
  size, income, jobs proximity, street network grain, and local topography. Takeaway
  for practice: Interconnected grid-like street networks offer practitioners an important
  tool for curbing car dependence and emissions. Once established, street patterns
  determine urban spatial structure for centuries, so proactive planning is essential.'
