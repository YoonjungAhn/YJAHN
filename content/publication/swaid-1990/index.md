abstract: The analytical cluster thermal time constant (CTTC) model, developed earlier
  by the authors, is used to simulate the effects of urban artificial heat release
  and increased shaded ground-layer areas on the urban canopy layer (UCL) climate.
  Hourly mean artificial heat addition of 55 W m-2, caused by transportation and electric
  use, is considered here as the anthropogenic energetic input to the urban atmosphere
  in summer. In an urban cluster composed of repeated similar street canyons oriented
  east-west with an aspect ratio (H/W, buildings' height to street width ratio) of
  0.5, this heat addition rate causes a diurnal air temperature increase of 1-2.5
  K peaking at 20:00. In summer, increasing the partially shaded ground area by adequate
  urban and building planning strategies can result in an appreciable temperature
  decrease at midday, provided that the mean sky view factor of the locality remains
  as high as possible. Â© 1990.
