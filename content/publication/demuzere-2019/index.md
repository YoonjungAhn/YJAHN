abstract: Cities are major drivers of environmental change at all scales and are especially
  at risk from the ensuing effects, which include poor air quality, flooding and heat
  waves. Typically, these issues are studied on a city-by-city basis owing to the
  spatial complexity of built landscapes, local topography and emission patterns.
  However, to ensure knowledge sharing and to integrate local-scale processes with
  regional and global scale modelling initiatives, there is a pressing need for a
  world-wide database on cities that is suited for environmental studies. In this
  paper we present a European database that has a particular focus on characterising
  urbanised landscapes. It has been derived using tools and techniques developed as
  part of the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) project, which
  has the goal of acquiring and disseminating climate-relevant information on cities
  worldwide. The European map is the first major step toward creating a global database
  on cities that can be integrated with existing topographic and natural land-cover
  databases to support modelling initiatives.
