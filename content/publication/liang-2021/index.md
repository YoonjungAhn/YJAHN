abstract: Wildfires have become an important source of particulate matter (PM2.5 <
  2.5-Î¼m diameter), leading to unhealthy air quality index occurrences in the western
  United States. Since people mainly shelter indoors during wildfire smoke events,
  the infiltration of wildfire PM2.5 into indoor environments is a key determinant
  of human exposure and is potentially controllable with appropriate awareness, infrastructure
  investment, and public education. Using time-resolved observations outside and inside
  more than 1,400 buildings from the crowdsourced PurpleAir sensor network in California,
  we found that the geometric mean infiltration ratios (indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin/
  outdoor PM2.5) were reduced from 0.4 during non-fire days to 0.2 during wildfire
  days. Even with reduced infiltration, the mean indoor concentration of PM2.5 nearly
  tripled during wildfire events, with a lower infiltration in newer buildings and
  those utilizing air conditioning or filtration.
