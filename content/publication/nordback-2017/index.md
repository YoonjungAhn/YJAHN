abstract: Estimates of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) drive policy and planning decisions
  for surface transportation. No similar metric is computed for cycling and walking.
  What approaches could be used to compute such a metric on the state level? This
  report discusses three such approaches, identifies the advantages and disadvantages
  of each, and applies them to Washington State. The first approach employs travel
  survey data. The second approach is sample-based using pedestrian and bicycle count
  data. The third approach is an aggregate demand model approach using demographic
  data combined with count data. Due to data limitations, none of these methods could
  be properly implemented on the statewide level. Despite the data limits, the methods
  were implemented for one county (King County) in order to compare findings. The
  travel survey method estimated the lowest bicycle and pedestrian miles traveled
  (BMT and PMT), and the sample-based method estimated the highest. The travel survey
  method is useful for a statewide measure, but it does not provide the detail needed
  for facility-level estimates. For bicyclists, the sample-based method is appropriate
  if volumes are desired at the facility level. For pedestrians, the aggregate model
  might be more appropriate, because of the more dispersed nature of pedestrian travel.
  Each method has strengths and weaknesses, and each helps with understanding bicycle
  and pedestrian travel in different ways. For this reason, the project team recommends
  improving both statewide travel survey data and pedestrian and cyclist traffic count
  data which feed these methods. Travel survey data should be collected statewide
  with oversampling for non-motorized travelers. Pedestrian and cyclist traffic counts
  should be expanded to include a continuous counting program in addition to the short-duration
  count program. After the continuous count program is in place, short-duration counts
  should be chosen using a stratified random sampling approach. For example, the sampling
  frame could consist of all road and path segments in the state divided by region
  (Coast Range, Puget Lowland, Cascades, Eastern Washington), by urbanity (rural,
  urban), by facility type (highways/arterials, local/collector roads, paths), and
  by whether the location is on a bridge or not. To increase sites sampled, the short-duration
  count program could also be rotated, with each location being counted every three
  years instead of every year. Better data will allow the state to quantify bicycling
  and walking at both the state level and facility level to inform decision-making,
  facility design and planning, and safety analysis.
