abstract: Because of the increasing concerns about climate change and deadly heatwaves
  in the past, the health effects of hot weather are fast becoming a global public
  health challenge for the 21st century. Some cities across the world have introduced
  public health protection measures, with the timely provision of appropriate home-based
  prevention advice to the general public being the most crucial point of intervention.
  In this Review, we report current epidemiological and physiological evidence about
  the range of health effects associated with hot weather, and draw attention to the
  interplay between climate factors, human susceptibility, and adaptation measures
  that contribute to heat burdens. We focus on the evidence base for the most commonly
  provided heat-protection advice, and make recommendations about the optimum clinical
  and public health practice that are expected to reduce health problems associated
  with current and future hot weather. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
