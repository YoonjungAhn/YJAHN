abstract: Long term, global records of urban extent can help evaluate environmental
  impacts of anthropogenic activities. Remotely sensed observations can provide insights
  into historical urban dynamics, but only during the satellite era. Here, we develop
  a 1 km resolution global dataset of annual urban dynamics between 1870 and 2100
  using an urban cellular automata model trained on satellite observations of urban
  extent between 1992 and 2013. Hindcast (1870–1990) and projected (2020–2100) urban
  dynamics under the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were modeled. We find
  that global urban growth under SSP5, the fossil-fuelled development scenario, was
  largest with a greater than 40-fold increase in urban extent since 1870. The high
  resolution dataset captures grid level urban sprawl over 200 years, which can provide
  insights into the urbanization life cycle of cities and help assess long-term environmental
  impacts of urbanization and human–environment interactions at a global scale.
