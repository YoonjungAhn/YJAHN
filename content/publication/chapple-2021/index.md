abstract: The rapid growth of tech company headquarters such as Apple, Facebook, and
  Google could potentially put new pressure on the housing market in adjacent residential
  neighborhoods, in the form of housing price appreciation and real estate speculation.
  This article examines the relationship between the big tech corporate campuses and
  Silicon Valley/San Francisco housing markets using the Zillow (ZTRAX) transaction
  and tax assessor data. The authors compare real estate activity adjacent to new
  company locations with activity in nearby areas, conducting a difference-in-differences
  analysis to estimate changes in housing prices and speculation. They find that housing
  prices increase overall by an additional 7.1% in the immediate vicinity of the tech
  campus 2 years after arrival, with wide variation across campuses. The authors also
  identify significant real estate speculation occurring prior to firmsâ€™ arrival.
  This suggests that cities should take a proactive role in mitigating tech firm impacts
  on vulnerable adjacent neighborhoods.
