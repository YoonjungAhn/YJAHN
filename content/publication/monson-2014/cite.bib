 abstract = {"Fluxes of trace gases, water and energy - the 'breathing of the biosphere' - are controlled by a large number of interacting physical, chemical, biological and ecological processes. In this interdisciplinary book, the authors provide the tools to understand and quantitatively analyse fluxes of energy, organic compounds such as terpenes, and trace gases including carbon dioxide, water vapour and methane. It first introduces the fundamental principles affecting the supply and demand for trace gas exchange at the leaf and soil scales: thermodynamics, diffusion, turbulence, and physiology. It then builds on these principles to model the exchange of water, carbon dioxide, terpenes, and stable isotopes at the ecosystem scale. Detailed mathematical derivations of commonly-used relations in biosphere-atmosphere interactions are provided for reference in Appendices. An accessible introduction for graduate students, and a key resource for researchers in related fields such as atmospheric science, hydrology, meteorology, climate science, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem ecology"-- "Fluxes of trace gases, water and energy between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere govern the state and fate of these two coupled systems. This 'breathing of the biosphere' is controlled by a large number of interacting physical, chemical, biological and ecological processes. In this integrated and interdisciplinary book, the authors provide the tools to understand and quantitatively analyse fluxes of energy, trace gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapour, methane, and organic compounds, such as terpenes"-- Preface -- 1.
