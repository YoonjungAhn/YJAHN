abstract: Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the United
  States. Many individuals, however, fail to perceive this risk, which will be exacerbated
  by global warming. Given that awareness of one’s physical and social vulnerability
  is a critical precursor to preparedness for extreme weather events, understanding
  Americans’ perceptions of heat risk and their geographic variability is essential
  for promoting adaptive behaviors during heat waves. Using a large original survey
  dataset of 9,217 respondents, we create and validate a model of Americans’ perceived
  risk to their health from extreme heat in all 50 US states, 3,142 counties, and
  72,429 populated census tracts. States in warm climates (e.g., Texas, Nevada, and
  Hawaii) have some of the highest heat-risk perceptions, yet states in cooler climates
  often face greater health risks from heat. Likewise, places with older populations
  who have increased vulnerability to health effects of heat tend to have lower risk
  perceptions, putting them at even greater risk since lack of awareness is a barrier
  to adaptive responses. Poorer neighborhoods and those with larger minority populations
  generally have higher risk perceptions than wealthier neighborhoods with more white
  residents, consistent with vulnerability differences across these populations. Comprehensive
  models of extreme weather risks, exposure, and effects should take individual perceptions,
  which motivate behavior, into account. Understanding risk perceptions at fine spatial
  scales can also support targeting of communication and education initiatives to
  where heat adaptation efforts are most needed.
