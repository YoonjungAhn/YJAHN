publication: '*The impacts of climate change on human health in the United States:
  A scientific assessment*'
abstract: Climate change threatens human health and well-being in the United States.
  The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) Climate and Health Assessment has
  been developed to enhance understanding and inform decisions about this growing
  threat. This scientific assessment, called for under the President's Climate Action
  Plan, is a major report of the sustained National Climate Assessment (NCA) process.
  The report responds to the 1990 Congressional mandate to assist the Nation in understanding,
  assessing, predicting, and responding to human-induced and natural processes of
  global change. The agencies of the USGCRP identified human health impacts as a high-priority
  topic for scientific assessment. The purpose of this assessment is to provide a
  comprehensive, evidence-based, and, where possible, quantitative estimation of observed
  and projected climate change related health impacts in the United States. The USGCRP
  Climate and Health Assessment has been developed to inform public health officials,
  urban and disaster response planners, decision makers, and other stakeholders within
  and outside of government who are interested in better understanding the risks climate
  change presents to human health.
