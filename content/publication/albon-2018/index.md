abstract: 100 recipes that teach you how to perform various machine learning tasks
  in the real worldAbout This BookUnderstand which algorithms to use in a given context
  with the help of this exciting recipe-based guideLearn about perceptrons and see
  how they are used to build neural networksStuck while making sense of images, text,
  speech, and real estate? This guide will come to your rescue, showing you how to
  perform machine learning for each one of these using various techniquesWho This
  Book Is ForThis book is for Python programmers who are looking to use machine-learning
  algorithms to create real-world applications. This book is friendly to Python beginners,
  but familiarity with Python programming would certainly be useful to play around
  with the code.What You Will LearnExplore classification algorithms and apply them
  to the income bracket estimation problemUse predictive modeling and apply it to
  real-world problemsUnderstand how to perform market segmentation using unsupervised
  learningExplore data visualization techniques to interact with your data in diverse
  waysFind out how to build a recommendation engineUnderstand how to interact with
  text data and build models to analyze itWork with speech data and recognize spoken
  words using Hidden Markov ModelsAnalyze stock market data using Conditional Random
  FieldsWork with image data and build systems for image recognition and biometric
  face recognitionGrasp how to use deep neural networks to build an optical character
  recognition systemIn DetailMachine learning is becoming increasingly pervasive in
  the modern data-driven world. It is used extensively across many fields such as
  search engines, robotics, self-driving cars, and more.With this book, you will learn
  how to perform various machine learning tasks in different environments. We’ll start
  by exploring a range of real-life scenarios where machine learning can be used,
  and look at various building blocks. Throughout the book, you’ll use a wide variety
  of machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems and use Python to implement
  these algorithms.You’ll discover how to deal with various types of data and explore
  the differences between machine learning paradigms such as supervised and unsupervised
  learning. We also cover a range of regression techniques, classification algorithms,
  predictive modeling, data visualization techniques, recommendation engines, and
  more with the help of real-world examples.Style and approachYou will explore various
  real-life scenarios in this book where machine learning can be used, and learn about
  different building blocks of machine learning using independent recipes in the book.Downloading
