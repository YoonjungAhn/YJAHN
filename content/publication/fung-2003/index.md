abstract: Background. Time series analysis is the most commonly used technique for
  assessing the association between counts of health events over time and exposure
  to ambient air pollution. Recently, case-crossover analysis has been proposed as
  an alternative analytical approach. While each technique has its own advantages
  and disadvantages, there remains considerable uncertainty as to which statistical
  methodology is preferable for evaluating data of this type. Methods. The objective
  of this paper is to evaluate the performance of different variations of these two
  procedures using computer simulation. Hospital admission data were generated under
  realistic models with known parameters permitting estimates based on time series
  and case-crossover analyses to be compared with these known values. Results. While
  accurate estimates can be achieved with both methods, both methods require some
  decisions to be made by the researcher during the course of the analysis. With time
  series analysis, it is necessary to choose the time span in the LOESS smoothing
  process, or degrees of freedom when using natural cubic splines. For case-crossover
  studies using either uni- or bi-directional control selection strategies, the choice
  of time intervals needs to be made. Conclusions. We prefer the times series approach
  because the best estimates of risk that can be obtained with time series analysis
  are more precise than the best estimates based on case-crossover analysis.
