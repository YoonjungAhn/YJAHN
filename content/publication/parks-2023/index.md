abstract: Limited evidence exists on how temperature increases are associated with
  hospital visits from alcohol- and substance-related disorders, despite plausible
  behavioral and physiological pathways. In the present study, we implemented&nbsp;a
  case-crossover design, which controls for seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and
  non- or slowly-varying confounders, with distributed lag non-linear temperature
  terms (0–6 days) to estimate associations between daily ZIP Code-level temperature
  and alcohol- and substance-related disorder hospital visit rates in New York State
  during 1995–2014. We also examined&nbsp;four substance-related disorder sub-causes
  (cannabis, cocaine, opioid, sedatives). Here we show that, for alcohol-related disorders,
  a daily increase in temperature from the daily minimum (−30.1 °C (−22.2 °F)) to
  the 75th percentile (18.8 °C (65.8 °F)) across 0–6 lag days is associated with a
  cumulative 24.6% (95%CI,14.6%–34.6%) increase in hospital visit rates, largely driven
  by increases on the day of and day before hospital visit, with an association larger
  outside New York City. For substance-related disorders, we find evidence of a positive
  association at temperatures from the daily minimum (−30.1 °C (−22.2 °F)) to the
  50th percentile (10.4 °C (50.7 °F)) (37.7% (95%CI,27.2%–48.2%), but not at higher
  temperatures. Findings are consistent across age group, sex, and social vulnerability.
  Our work highlights how hospital visits from alcohol- and substance-related disorders
  are currently impacted by elevated temperatures and could be further affected by
  rising temperatures resulting from climate change. Enhanced social infrastructure
  and health system interventions could mitigate these impacts. We investigated the
  relationship between temperature and hospital visits related to alcohol and other
  drugs including cannabis, cocaine, opioids, and sedatives in New York State. We
  found that higher temperatures resulted in more hospital visits for alcohol. For
  other drugs, higher temperatures also resulted in more hospital visits but only
  up to a certain temperature level. Our findings suggest that rising temperatures,
  including those caused by climate change, may influence hospital visits for alcohol
  and other drugs, emphasizing the need for appropriate and proportionate social and
  health interventions, as well as highlighting potential hidden burdens of climate
  change. Parks et al. find that higher temperatures are associated with increased
  hospital visits for alcohol- and substance-related disorders in New York State.
  This suggests that rising temperatures due to climate change may impact the burden
  of mental health-related conditions.
