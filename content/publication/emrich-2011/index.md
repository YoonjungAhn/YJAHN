abstract: The southern United States is no stranger to hazard and disaster events.
  Intense hurricanes, drought, flooding, and other climate-sensitive hazards are commonplace
  and have outnumbered similar events in other areas of the United States annually
  in both scale and magnitude by a ratio of almost 4:1 during the past 10 years. While
  losses fromclimate-sensitive hazards are forecast to increase in the coming years,
  not all of the populations residing within these hazard zones have the same capacity
  to prepare for, respond to, cope with, and rebound from disaster events. The identification
  of these vulnerable populations and their location relative to zones of known or
  probably future hazard exposure is necessary for the development and implementation
  of effective adaptation, mitigation, and emergency management strategies. This paper
  provides an approach to regional assessments of hazards vulnerability by describing
  and integrating hazard zone information on four climatesensitive hazards with socioeconomic
  and demographic data to create an index showing both the areal extent of hazard
  exposure and social vulnerability for the southern United States. When examined
  together, these maps provide an assessment of the likely spatial impacts of these
  climate-sensitive hazards and their variability. The identification of hotspots-counties
  with elevated exposures and elevated social vulnerability-highlights the distribution
  of the most at risk counties and the driving factors behind them. Results provide
  the evidentiary basis for developing targeted strategic initiatives for disaster
  risk reduction including preparedness for response and recovery and longer-term
  adaptation in those most vulnerable and highly impacted areas. Â© 2011 American Meteorological
