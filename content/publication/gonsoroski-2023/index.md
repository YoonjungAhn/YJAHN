abstract: Post-hurricane damage assessments are often costly and time-consuming. Remotely
  sensed data provides a complementary method of data collection that can be completed
  comparatively quickly and at relatively low cost. This study focuses on 15 Florida
  counties impacted by Hurricane Michael (2018), which had category 5 strength winds
  at landfall. The present study evaluates the ability of aerial imagery collected
  to cost-effectively measure blue tarps on buildings for disaster impact and recovery.
  A support vector machine model classified blue tarp, and parcels received a damage
  indicator based on the model's prediction. The model had an overall accuracy of
  85.3% with a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 96.7%. The model results indicated
  approximately 7% of all parcels (27 926 residential and 4431 commercial parcels)
  in the study area as having blue tarp present. The study results may benefit jurisdictions
  that lacked financial resources to conduct on-the-ground damage assessments.
