abstract: The indoor micro-environment has its own pollutants and pollution levels
  indoors may be higher than those outdoors. This is particularly so when there are
  combustion processes associated with cooking heating or smoking coupled with poor
  ventilation. About half the world's population have to rely for cooking; and associated
  space heating on simple household stoves using unprocessed solid fuels that have
  high emission factors, with the consequence that they are exposed to high levels
  of health-damaging air pollutants. Cooking can produce very high concentrations
  of particles and biomass fuels emit hundreds of chemicals during small-scale combustion,
  such as in household cooking or heating stoves. Tobacco smoke may add to other biomass
  smoke and all these together cause considerable human ill health world-wide. Most
  indoor air pollutants directly affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems
  and the severity of the effect varies according to both the intensity and the duration
  of exposure, and also the health status of the population exposed. The importance
  of this is that some members of the population may be at greater risk than others.
  A number of the chemicals found in the indoor environment are classed as carcinogens
  although at the levels found the probability that they will cause cancer is extremely
  low. This is not to lessen the problem. In a 1987 study, the U.S. Environmental
  Protection Agency ranked indoor air pollution fourth in cancer risk among the 13
  top environmental problems analysed.
