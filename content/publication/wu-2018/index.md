abstract: '• PM 2.5 variability was assessed by the hybrid kriging/LUR model • High
  explanatory power (R 2 N 0.85) was confirmed regardless of the model temporal resolutions.
  • R 2 increase from 26 to 29%, and it was obtained by the hybrid methodology. •
  PM 2.5 concentrations estimated from Kriging has the highest explanatory power in
  the resultant models. Editor: P. Kassomenos Proximate pollutant data can provide
  information for land-use predictors in LUR models, when coupled with spatial interpolation
  of ambient pollutant measurements, may provide better pollutant predictions. This
  study applies a hybrid kriging/LUR model to assess the spatial-temporal variability
  of PM 2.5 for Taiwan. Using PM 2.5 concentrations at 71 EPA monitoring stations
  from 2006 to 2011, pollutant gradient surfaces were spatially interpolated using
  a leave-one-out ordinary kriging method based on \"n-1\" observations. The predicted
  concentration level of the targeted site was then extracted from the generated kriging
  map and adopted as a variable in LUR modelling. Annual and monthly resolutions of
  LUR models were developed to assess the effects by incorporating kriging-based estimates
  into pollutant predictions. The R 2 obtained from conventional LUR procedures was
  0.66 and 0.70 for annual and monthly models, respectively, whereas models using
  the hybrid approach showed better explanatory power (R 2 of annual model: 0.85;
  R 2 of monthly model: 0.88). Moreover, kriging-based PM 2.5 estimates were the most
  important factor in the resultant models according to the dominant partial R 2 of
  0.82 and 0.7 in monthly and yearly models. Cross-validation and external data verification
  showed similar results, demonstrating robustness of the proposed approach. Using
  governmental pollutant observations is usually publicly available for most areas,
  this method provides an efficient mean to better assess PM 2.5 spatial-temporal
  variations and predicts levels for nonmonitored areas.'
