 abstract = {The U.S. Army has a need for continuous, accurate estimates of the wet bulb globe temperature to protect soldiers and civilian workers from heat-related injuries, including those involved in the storage and destruction of aging chemical munitions at depots across the United States. At these depots, workers must don protective clothing that increases their risk of heat-related injury. Because of the difficulty in making continuous, accurate measurements of wet bulb globe temperature outdoors, the authors have developed a model of the wet bulb globe temperature that relies only on standard meteorological data available at each storage depot for input. The model is composed of separate submodels of the natural wet bulb and globe temperatures that are based on fundamental principles of heat and mass transfer, has no site-dependent parameters, and achieves an accuracy of better than 1 degree C based on comparisons with wet bulb globe temperature measurements at all depots.},

 note = {Liljegren et al. (2008) mentioned that previous research results have the limitation of applicate the result for the practical use because it contains considerable errors. Therefore, this study developed a WBGT model and compare the result with the observed weather data. This study used ﻿natural wet bulb temperature Tw, the globe temperature Tg, and the dry bulb (ambient) temperature Ta to deduce Wet Bulb Globe Temperature(WBGT). <br/>The author describes the model according to 3 parts: Tw, Tg, and Ta. The author calculated Tw based on a model calculating the loss of energy by using pressure(evaporation). Tg is calculated by ﻿the radiative and convective heat transfer process. Tg part illustrates the energy gain by solar radiation. Ta represents ambient temperature. <br/>The author compared the model result from the observation data from several places. The author included a grass area, dessert, and cities. WBGT shows significant bias in the desert area. The authors believe that it caused by ﻿the measured natural wet bulb temperature. However, the model result has less error range than the previous research. The author concluded that the WBGT results are varied in the area because of cloudiness. The author insists that including solar radiation data is likely to reduce the biased results of WBGT.  <br/>This research illustrated the limitation of previous research’s WBGT model. The result shows that Tg is the most important factor and the variations are caused by solar radiation. I think this is the reason why among many other WBGT models, this model has fewer errors and is widely used.},
