abstract: The U.S. Army has a need for continuous, accurate estimates of the wet bulb
  globe temperature to protect soldiers and civilian workers from heat-related injuries,
  including those involved in the storage and destruction of aging chemical munitions
  at depots across the United States. At these depots, workers must don protective
  clothing that increases their risk of heat-related injury. Because of the difficulty
  in making continuous, accurate measurements of wet bulb globe temperature outdoors,
  the authors have developed a model of the wet bulb globe temperature that relies
  only on standard meteorological data available at each storage depot for input.
  The model is composed of separate submodels of the natural wet bulb and globe temperatures
  that are based on fundamental principles of heat and mass transfer, has no site-dependent
  parameters, and achieves an accuracy of better than 1 degree C based on comparisons
  with wet bulb globe temperature measurements at all depots.
