abstract: 'The distribution of overall temperature and the frequency of heat waves
  may be shifting due to climate change. However, forecasting future health consequences
  of higher temperatures in a given city is complicated by uncertainties in how populations
  and societal infrastructure will adapt. This paper reviews approaches to address
  these challenges, including: (1) using historical weather-mortality relationships
  for the same region, or a location with a similar climate as the city of interest;
  (2) evaluating adaptation using the minimum mortality threshold (MMT) temperature
  (i.e., the temperature with the lowest mortality rate); and (3) estimating the impact
  of modifiers (e.g., air conditioning, population density, green space) on the temperature
  and mortality relation, and then predicting a range of effects based on plausible
  estimates for the future values of these parameters in a given city. Each approach
  can provide insight into how heat could affect mortality under a changing climate,
  but all have uncertainties. In spite of these limitations, projecting the future
  public health burden of temperature-related health effects can provide valuable
  information to aid public health and environmental authorities in planning and communicating
  the risks of climate change to the public. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'
