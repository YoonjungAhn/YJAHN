abstract: The association between short-term elevations in ambient particulate air
  pollution and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well documented.
  Ambient particles may also trigger acute decompensation in patients with congestive
  heart failure (CHF), but this hypothesis has not been evaluated in a systematic
  manner. This study evaluated the association between daily levels of respirable
  particulate matter of aerodynamic diameters ≤10 μm (PM10) and the rate of hospitalization
  from the emergency room for CHF in Medicare recipients (age ≥65 years) in 7 United
  States cities from 1986 and 1999. The time-stratified case-crossover design was
  used to separately estimate the effect of a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 in each city.
  A combined random-effects estimate was then obtained from the city-specific effect
  estimates. There were 292,918 admissions with primary diagnoses of CHF during the
  observation period. Overall, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 0.72%
  (95% confidence interval 0.35% to 1.10%) increase in the rate of admission for CHF
  on the same day. The effect of PM10 appeared to be less in patients with secondary
  diagnoses of hypertension. There was no consistent effect modification by age, gender,
  race, or any other secondary diagnosis evaluated. In conclusion, these results support
  the hypothesis that elevated levels of particulate air pollution, below the current
  limits set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, are associated
  with an increase in the rate of hospital admission for exacerbation of CHF.
