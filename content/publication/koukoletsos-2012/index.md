abstract: New, free and fast growing spatial data sources have appeared online, based
  on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most
  representative projects of this trend. Its increasing popularity and density makes
  the study of its data quality an imperative. A common approach is to compare OSM
  with a reference dataset. In such cases, data matching is necessary for the comparison
  to be meaningful, and is usually performed manually at the data preparation stage.
  This article proposes an automated feature-based matching method specifically designed
  for VGI, based on a multi-stage approach that combines geometric and attribute constraints.
  It is applied to the OSM dataset using the official data from Ordnance Survey as
  the reference dataset. The results are then used to evaluate data completeness of
  OSM in several case studies in the UK. Â© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
