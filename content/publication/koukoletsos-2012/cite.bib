 abstract = {New, free and fast growing spatial data sources have appeared online, based on Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most representative projects of this trend. Its increasing popularity and density makes the study of its data quality an imperative. A common approach is to compare OSM with a reference dataset. In such cases, data matching is necessary for the comparison to be meaningful, and is usually performed manually at the data preparation stage. This article proposes an automated feature-based matching method specifically designed for VGI, based on a multi-stage approach that combines geometric and attribute constraints. It is applied to the OSM dataset using the official data from Ordnance Survey as the reference dataset. The results are then used to evaluate data completeness of OSM in several case studies in the UK. Â© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
