abstract: "Background: The impact of global warming on population health is a growing
  concern and has been widely discussed. The issue of heat stress disorders and consequent
  productivity reduction among workers has not yet been widely addressed. Taiwan is
  an island straddling the Tropic of Cancer in the West Pacific and has both subtropical
  and tropical climates. As of 2008, the economy of Taiwan accounts for 1.1% of the
  world gross domestic product at purchasing power parity and is listed as 19th in
  the world and eighth in Asia, according to International Monetary Fund data. Objective:
  The aim of this paper is to identify occupations at risk and the potential health
  impacts of heat on workers in Taiwan. Design: Historical data relating to meteorology,
  population, the labour force and economy were obtained from publicly available databases
  from the Taiwanese government. Results: Hot seasons with an average maximum temperature
  above 30°C and relative humidity above 74%, lasting for four to six months from
  May to October, pose health threats to construction, farming and fishery workers.
  In particular, populations of ageing farmers and physically overloaded construction
  workers are the two most vulnerable worker categories in which high temperature
  impacts on health and productivity. Conclusions: Currently, regulations and preventive
  actions for heat relief are difficult to enforce for several reasons, including
  lack of equipment for measuring environmental conditions, lack of awareness of potential
  hazards and strict time constraints imposed on workers. There is an urgent need
  to systematically and comprehensively assess the impact of a warming climate on
  workers' health and productivity to provide effective prevention strategies for
  a better working and living environment in Taiwan. © 2009 Ro-Ting Lin and Chang-Chuan
