abstract: 'The WBGT index is a common method to evaluate heat stress in the workplaces
  based on human physiological responses to environmental conditions. This systematic
  and meta-analysis study was aimed to estimate the mean value of the WBGT index in
  industries. The search protocol of this study was carried out according to PRISMA
  checklist. According to the heterogeneity of studies, a meta-analysis was done using
  a random effects model. The total value of WBGT index in the world according to
  this study was obtained 28.92 °C (95% CI: 28. 49–29. 35). The results regarding
  the fixed effect analysis showed that, average WBGT index before and after 2010,
  was estimated to be 26.63 °C (95% CI: 26.53–26.73) and 29.78 °C (95% CI: 29.71–29.85),
  respectively. The mean value of WBGT index in the men and women participants were
  29.42 and 24.26 °C, respectively. The finding indicated that the average value of
  WBGT index is rising over time. The reason for this may be attributed to global
  warming or lack of proper physical work condition in these environments. It would
  be alarming for the workers who worked in outdoor environments or hot operating
  conditions.'
