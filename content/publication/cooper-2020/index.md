abstract: 'Context: Interscholastic heat policies for football have not been evidence
  based. Therefore, their effectiveness in mitigating exertional heat illness has
  not been assessed. Objective: To discuss the development of the Georgia High School
  Association heat policy and assess the effectiveness of revised guidelines. Design:
  Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Georgia high schools. Patients or Other
  Participants: Interscholastic football players in grades 9 through 12. Main Outcome
  Measure(s): Heat syncope and heat exhaustion (HS/HE) illness rates (IRs) were calculated
  per 1000 athlete-exposures (AEs), and relative risk (RR) was calculated as a ratio
  of postpolicy (POST) IR divided by prepolicy (PRE) IR. Results: A total of 214 HS/HE
  cases (172 PRE, 42 POST) and 341 348 AEs (178 230 PRE, 163 118 POST) were identified.
  During the first 5 days of the PRE period, approximately 50% of HS/HE illnesses
  occurred; HS/HE IRs doubled when practice sessions increased from 2 to 2.5 hours
  and tripled for practices â‰¥3 hours. The HS/HE IRs in the PRE period increased from
  0.44/1000 AEs for wet-bulb globe temperatures (WBGTs) of,828F (,27.88C) to .2.0/1000
  AEs for WBGTs from 878F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C). The RRs comparing PRE and POST
  policy periods were 0.29 for WBGTs of,82.08F (,27.808C), 0.65 for WBGTs from 82.08F
  (27.88C) to 86.98F (30.58C), and 0.23 for WBGTs from 87.08F (30.68C) to 89.98F (32.28C).
  No HS/HE illnesses occurred in the POST period for WBGTs at .908F (.32.38C). Conclusions:
  Results from the PRE period guided the Georgia High School Association to revise
  its heat and humidity policy to include a mandated 5-day acclimatization period
  when no practices may exceed 2 hours and the use of WBGT-based activity-modification
  categories. The new policy reduced HS/HE IRs by 35% to 100%, depending on the WBGT
  category. Our results may be generalizable to other states with hot and humid climates
  similar to that of Georgia.'
