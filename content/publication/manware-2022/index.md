abstract: Adverse health outcomes caused by extreme heat represent the most direct
  human health threat associated with the warming of the Earth's climate. Socioeconomic,
  demographic, health, land cover, and temperature determinants contribute to heat
  vulnerability; however, nationwide patterns of residential and race/ethnicity disparities
  in heat vulnerability in the United States are poorly understood. This study aimed
  to develop a Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) for the United States; to assess differences
  in heat vulnerability across geographies that have experienced historical and/or
  contemporary forms of marginalization; and to quantify HVI by race/ethnicity. Principal
  component analysis was used to calculate census tract level HVI scores based on
  the 2019 population characteristics of the United States. Differences in HVI scores
  were analyzed across the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) “redlining” grades,
  the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) disadvantaged versus non-disadvantaged
  communities, and race/ethnicity groups. HVI scores were calculated for 55,267 U.S.
  census tracts. Mean HVI scores were 17.56, 18.61, 19.45, and 19.93 for HOLC grades
  “A”–“D,” respectively. CEJST-defined disadvantaged census tracts had a significantly
  higher mean HVI score (19.13) than non-disadvantaged tracts (16.68). The non-Hispanic
  African American or Black race/ethnicity group had the highest HVI score (18.51),
  followed by Hispanic or Latino (18.19). Historically redlined and contemporary CEJST
  disadvantaged census tracts and communities of color were found to be associated
  with increased vulnerability to heat. These findings can help promote equitable
  climate change adaptation policies by informing policymakers about the national
  distribution of place- and race/ethnicity-based disparities in heat vulnerability.
