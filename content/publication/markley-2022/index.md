abstract: Subcounty housing unit counts are important for studying geo-historical
  patterns of (sub)urbanization, land-use change, and residential loss and gain. The
  most commonly used subcounty geographical unit for social research in the United
  States is the census tract. However, the changing geometries and historically incomplete
  coverage of tracts present significant obstacles for longitudinal analysis that
  existing datasets do not sufficiently address. Overcoming these barriers, we provide
  housing unit estimates in consistent 2010 tract boundaries for every census year
  from 1940 to 2010 plus 2019 for the entire continental US. Moreover, we develop
  an “urbanization year” indicator that denotes if and when tracts became “urbanized”
  during this timeframe. We produce these data by blending existing interpolation
  techniques with a novel procedure we call “maximum reabsorption.” Conducting out-of-sample
  validation, we find that our hybrid approach generally produces more reliable estimates
  than existing alternatives. The final dataset, Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization
  Database 2010 (HHUUD10), has myriad potential uses for research involving housing,
  population, and land-use change, as well as (sub)urbanization.
