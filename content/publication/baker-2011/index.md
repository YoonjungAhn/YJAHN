abstract: 'Affordable housing is a critical issue facing many rural communities. Mobile
  home parks are a form of affordable housing prevalent in rural areas that is being
  lost as parks close across the United States and few new parks are developed. Limited
  research on how residents view their parks and the public perception that mobile
  home parks are undesirable may diminish efforts to prevent park closures. This paper
  considers how mobile home residents view their quality of life and housing issues
  living in this type of rural community. Findings from a survey of two hundred and
  fifty-six residents at nine mobile home parks in Vermont are reported. Respondents
  were asked how they viewed their housing, neighborhood, park management, and infrastructure.
  Residents were found to have lower incomes than other households in the state. Most
  were satisfied with life in the park, though lower income residents were significantly
  happier with the social atmosphere than those with higher incomes. For many households
  mobile home parks are not transitional housing but are rather places they have lived,
  and plan to live, for many years. This research can aid rural planners improve and
  develop future affordable housing, including the evolution of the mobile home park.   Keywords:
  affordable housing, manufactured housing, mobile home parks, rural communities'
