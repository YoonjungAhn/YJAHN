abstract: Wildfires are a significant threat to human health, in part through degraded
  air quality. Prescribed burning can reduce wildfire severity but can also lead to
  an increase in air pollution. The complexities of fires and atmospheric processes
  lead to uncertainties when predicting the air quality impacts of fire and make it
  difficult to fully assess the costs and benefits of an expansion of prescribed fire.
  By modeling differences in emissions, surface conditions, and meteorology between
  wildfire and prescribed burns, we present a novel comparison of the air quality
  impacts of these fire types under specific scenarios. One wildfire and two prescribed
  burn scenarios were considered, with one prescribed burn scenario optimized for
  potential smoke exposure. We found that PM2.5 emissions were reduced by 52%, from
  0.27 to 0.14 Tg, when fires burned under prescribed burn conditions, considerably
  reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Excess short-term mortality from PM2.5 exposure was
  40 deaths for fires under wildfire conditions and 39 and 15 deaths for fires under
  the default and optimized prescribed burn scenarios, respectively. Our findings
  suggest prescribed burns, particularly when planned during conditions that minimize
  smoke exposure, could be a net benefit for the impacts of wildfires on air quality
  and health.
