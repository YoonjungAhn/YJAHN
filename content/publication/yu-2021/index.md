abstract: 'Objectives: To identify the associations of temperature with non-COVID-19
  mortality and all-cause mortality in the pandemic 2020 in comparison with the non-COVID-19
  period in Italy. Methods: The data on 3,189,790 all-cause deaths (including 3,134,137
  non-COVID-19 deaths) and meteorological conditions in 107 Italian provinces between
  February 1st and November 30th in each year of 2015–2020 were collected. We employed
  a time-stratified case-crossover study design combined with the distributed lag
  non-linear model to investigate the relationships of temperature with all-cause
  and non-COVID-19 mortality in the pandemic and non-pandemic periods. Results: Cold
  temperature exposure contributed higher risks for both all-cause and non-COVID-19
  mortality in the pandemic period in 2020 than in 2015–2019. However, no different
  change was found for the impacts of heat. The relative risk (RR) of non-COVID-19
  deaths and all-cause mortality at extremely cold (2 °C) in comparison with the estimated
  minimum mortality temperature (19 °C) in 2020 were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.55–1.72) and
  1.45 (95%CI: 1.31–1.61) respectively, which were higher than all-cause mortality
  risk in 2015–2019 with RR of 1.19 (95%CI: 1.17–1.21). Conclusion: Cold exposure
  indicated stronger impacts than high temperatures on all-cause and non-COVID-19
  mortality in the pandemic year 2020 compared to its counterpart period in 2015–2019
  in Italy.'
