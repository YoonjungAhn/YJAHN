abstract: Interpolation of a spatially continuous variable from point samples is an
  important field in spatial analysis and surface models for geosciences. In this
  study, spatial interpolation methods which are Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW),
  Ordinary Kriging (OK), Modified Shepard's (MS), Multiquadric Radial Basis Function
  (MRBF) and Triangulation with Linear (TWL), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which
  is an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) method were compared in order to predict
  height for different point distributions such as curvature, grid, random and uniform
  on a Digital Elevation Model which is an USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED).
  This study also aims to quantify the effects of topographic variability and sampling
  density. Errors of different interpolations and ANN prediction were evaluated for
  different point distributions and three different crosssections on the characteristic
  parts of the surface were selected and analyzed. Generally, OK, MS, MRBF and TWL
  gave promising results and were more effective in terms of characteristics of surface
  than MLP and IDW. Although MLP simplified the contours obtained from predicted heights,
  it was a satisfactory predictor for curvature, grid, random and uniform distributions.
