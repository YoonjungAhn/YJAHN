abstract: Geospatial techniques, using Geographic Information Systems and remote sensing
  data, have become more commonly used with dasymetric modeling of fine-scale demographic
  data. In this study, we apply a dasymetric approach using the Heuristic Sampling
  Method for 2010 parcel data to disaggregate population counts from the 2010 U.S.
  Census into a quadrilateral grid composed of 30×30mcells covering the Alachua County,
  Florida. The final output, termed the High-resolution Gridded Population Surface
  (HGPS), is compared to a land cover-based population product (LCPP) and the detail
  of each product is assessed. Results suggest that the HGPS provides increased spatial
  heterogeneity and more detail in the boundaries of populated areas over the use
  of census blocks or land cover lots. For an example of the final output, we use
  a case study at the Cabot-Koppers Superfund Site to demonstrate the advantages of
  the HGPS over the LCPP. The HGPS is expected to serve as a more accurate input in
  various research fields, such as public health, crime analysis, and climate change.
  The approach outlined provides an improved means of producing spatially-explicit
  population grids where fine-scale ancillary data, such as parcel data, is available.
