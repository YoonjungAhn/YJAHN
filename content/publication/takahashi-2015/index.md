abstract: 'This study aims to explore whether broadcasting heat health warnings (HHWs),
  to every household and whether the additional home delivery of bottled water labeled
  with messages will be effective in improving the behaviors and knowledge of elderly
  people to prevent heat-related illness. A community trial on heat-related-illness-prevention
  behaviors and knowledge for people aged between 65 and 84 years was conducted in
  Nagasaki, Japan. Five hundred eight subjects were selected randomly from three groups:
  heat health warning (HHW), HHW and water delivery (HHW+W), and control groups. Baseline
  and follow-up questionnaires were conducted in June and September 2012, respectively.
  Of the 1524 selected subjects, the 1072 that completed both questionnaires were
  analyzed. The HHW+W group showed improvements in nighttime AC use (p = 0.047), water
  intake (p = 0.003), cooling body (p = 0.002) and reduced activities in heat (p =
  0.047) compared with the control, while the HHW group improved hat or parasol use
  (p = 0.008). An additional effect of household water delivery was observed in water
  intake (p = 0.067) and cooling body (p = 0.095) behaviors. HHW and household bottled
  water delivery improved heat-related-illness-prevention behaviors. The results indicate
  that home water delivery in addition to a HHW may be needed to raise awareness of
  the elderly.'
