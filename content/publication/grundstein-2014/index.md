abstract: American Football players are among the most susceptible athletes to heat-related
  illnesses. Environmental conditions are an important factor when considering risk
  rates for these illnesses. Thus, we examine the spatio-temporal variations in the
  wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a commonly used metric for heat exposure, and
  quantify the hazard for extreme heat using safety thresholds specifically derived
  for athletes from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The objective
  is to provide better information on heat-related hazards to help mitigate the risk
  of exertional heat illnesses (EHI) among football players. We created a unique 15-year
  climatology (1991-2005) of August WBGTs for 217 locations across the contiguous
  United States using weather station observations and a WBGT model. Thirteen 3-hoverlapping
  training session times ranging from 6-9 a.m. to 6-9 p.m. were examined to identify
  how the WBGT varies with the time of day the practice session was held and how frequently
  the WBGT during those sessions posed a hazard for extreme heat by exceeding two
  ACSM safety thresholds (30.1°C and 32.3°C). Maximum hazards for extreme heat are
  located in an arc across the Southern tier of the country, stretching from eastern
  Texas through to South Carolina as well as across southern Arizona and southeastern
  California. Climatologically, practice sessions early in the morning and later in
  the evening were best for minimizing heat exposure while those held from late morning
  through afternoon, particularly the noon-3 p.m. and 1-4 p.m. periods, had the highest
  WBGT values and were the practice periods that most frequently exceeded safety thresholds.
  Delaying the start of afternoon practices a few hours, however, may substantially
  reduce the likelihood of oppressive conditions and reduce the risk for heat illnesses.
