abstract: Heat stress is a significant health concern that can lead to illness, injury,
  and mortality. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index is one method for monitoring
  environmental heat risk. Generally, WBGT is estimated using a heat stress monitor
  that includes sensors capable of measuring ambient, wet bulb, and black globe temperature,
  and these measurements are combined to calculate WBGT. However, this method can
  be expensive, time consuming, and requires careful attention to ensure accurate
  and repeatable data. Therefore, researchers have attempted to use standard meteorological
  measurements, using single data sources as an input (e.g., weather stations) to
  calculate WBGT. Building on these efforts, we apply data from a variety of sources
  to calculate WBGT, understand the accuracy of our estimated equation, and compare
  the performance of different sources of input data. To do this, WBGT measurements
  were collected from Kestrel 5400 Heat Stress Trackers installed in three locations
  in Alabama. Data were also drawn from local weather stations, North American Land
  Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), and low cost iButton hygrometers. We applied previously
  published equations for estimating natural wet bulb temperature, globe temperature,
  and WBGT to these diverse data sources. Correlation results showed that WBGT estimates
  derived from all proxy data sources—weather station, weather station/iButton, NLDAS,
  NLDAS/iButton—were statistically indistinguishable from each other, or from the
  Kestrel measurements, at two of the three sites. However, at the same two sites,
  the addition of iButtons significantly reduced root mean square error and bias compared
  to other methods.
