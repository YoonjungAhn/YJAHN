abstract: <p>This study compared the relative risks of heat days on mortalities by
  vulnerable groups (elderly, single-person households, less-educated) in the past
  decade (1999–2008) and the recent decade (2009–2018) in four cities, Seoul, Incheon,
  Daegu, and Gwangju, in Korea. It has been known that the health impacts of heatwaves
  have gradually decreased over time due to socio-economic development, climate adaptation,
  and acclimatization. Contrary to general perception, we found that the recent relative
  risk of mortality caused by heat days has increased among vulnerable groups. It
  may associate with recent increasing trends of severe heat days due to climate change.
  The increasing relative risk was more significant in single-person households and
  less-educated groups than in the elderly. It implies that the impacts of climate
  change-induced severe heat days have been and will be concentrated on vulnerable
  groups. It suggests that social polarization and social isolation should be addressed
  to reduce heatwave impacts. Furthermore, this study shows the necessity of customized
  heatwave policies, which consider the characteristics of vulnerable groups.</p>
