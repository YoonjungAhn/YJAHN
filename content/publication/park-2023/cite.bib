 abstract = {<p>This study compared the relative risks of heat days on mortalities by vulnerable groups (elderly, single-person households, less-educated) in the past decade (1999–2008) and the recent decade (2009–2018) in four cities, Seoul, Incheon, Daegu, and Gwangju, in Korea. It has been known that the health impacts of heatwaves have gradually decreased over time due to socio-economic development, climate adaptation, and acclimatization. Contrary to general perception, we found that the recent relative risk of mortality caused by heat days has increased among vulnerable groups. It may associate with recent increasing trends of severe heat days due to climate change. The increasing relative risk was more significant in single-person households and less-educated groups than in the elderly. It implies that the impacts of climate change-induced severe heat days have been and will be concentrated on vulnerable groups. It suggests that social polarization and social isolation should be addressed to reduce heatwave impacts. Furthermore, this study shows the necessity of customized heatwave policies, which consider the characteristics of vulnerable groups.</p>},
