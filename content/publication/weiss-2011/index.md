abstract: With increasing concern about rising rates of obesity, public health researchers
  have begun to examine the availability of parks and other spaces for physical activity,
  particularly in cities, to assess whether access to parks reduces the risk of obesity.
  Much of the research in this field has shown that proximity to parks may support
  increased physical activity in urban environments; however, as yet, there has been
  limited consideration of environmental impediments or disamenities that might influence
  individualsâ€™ perceptions or usage of public recreation opportunities. Prior research
  suggests that neighborhood disamenities, for instance crime, pedestrian safety,
  and noxious land uses, might dissuade people from using parks or recreational facilities
  and vary by neighborhood composition. Motivated by such research, this study estimates
  the relationship between neighborhood compositional characteristics and measures
  of park facilities, controlling for variation in neighborhood disamenities, using
  geographic information systems (GIS) data for New York City parks and employing
  both kernel density estimation and distance measures. The central finding is that
  attention to neighborhood disamenities can appreciably alter the relationship between
  neighborhood composition and spatial access to parks. Policy efforts to enhance
  the recreational opportunities in urban areas should expand beyond a focus on availability
  to consider also the hazards and disincentives that may influence park usage.
