abstract: The study looks at the potential of physical characteristics in mitigating
  the urban heat island intensity (UHI) in London during summer. This research uses
  six on-site variables namely aspect ratio, surface albedo, plan density ratio, green
  density ratio, fabric density ratio and thermal mass for the investigation in six
  data sets. The climatic variations in summer are controlled by classifying the data
  into clear sky, partially cloudy and cloudy periods. Geographical variation is controlled
  by classifying the data into core, urban and semi urban areas. Maximum daytime UHI
  of 8.9 °C is found in semi-urban area during partially cloudy period while maximum
  nocturnal UHI of 8.6 °C is found in urban area during clear sky period when the
  wind velocity is below 5 m/s. The most critical climate and geographical location
  in determining the changes in outdoor air temperature in London are partially cloudy
  periods and urban areas respectively. Among the variables studied, most critical
  variable that determines the daytime and nocturnal changes in outdoor air temperature
  is surface albedo. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
