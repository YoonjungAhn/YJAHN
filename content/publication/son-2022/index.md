abstract: 'BACKGROUND Although previous literature suggested that several factors
  may be associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes related to heat, research
  is limited for birth outcomes.   OBJECTIVES We investigated associations between
  exposure to heat/heat waves during the last week of gestation and preterm birth
  (PTB) in North Carolina (NC) and evaluated effect modification by residential greenness,
  urbanicity, and socioeconomic status (SES).   METHODS We obtained individual-level
  NC birth certificate data for May–September 2003–2014. We estimated daily mean temperature
  at each maternal residential address using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent
  Slopes Model (PRISM) data. We created 3 definitions of heat waves (daily temperature
  ≥95th, 97th, 99th percentile for NC warm season temperature, for ≥2 consecutive
  days). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to assess residential
  greenness. Community-level modifiers (e.g., income, urbanicity) were considered.
  We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the association between exposure
  to heat/heat waves and PTB, controlling for covariates. Stratified analyses were
  conducted to evaluate whether the association between heat and PTB varied by several
  individual and community characteristics.   RESULTS Of the 546,441 births, 8% were
  preterm. Heat exposure during the last week before delivery was significantly associated
  with risk of PTB. The hazard ratio for a 1 °C increase in temperature during the
  last week before delivery was 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.02). Higher heat-PTB risk was
  associated with some characteristics (e.g., areas that were urbanized, low SES,
  or in the Coastal Plain). We also found significant PTB-heat risk in areas with
  low greenness for urbanized area. For heat waves, we did not find significantly
  positive associations with PTB.   DISCUSSION Findings provide evidence that exposure
  to heat during pregnancy increases risk of PTB and suggest disparities in these
  risks. Our results have implications for future studies of disparity in heat and
  birth outcomes associations.'
