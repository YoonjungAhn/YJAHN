abstract: 'Background: Pathophysiology of rhinitis in older adults is largely unknown.
  We tested whether air pollution is associated with this condition and how immune
  mechanisms may play a role in this relationship. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional
  data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a nationally representative
  study of older adults born between 1920 and 1947. Particulate matter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5)
  air pollution exposure estimates were generated using validated spatiotemporal models.
  Presence of rhinitis was defined based on medication use (≥1: intranasal medications:
  steroids, antihistamines, lubricants, and/or decongestants, and/or oral medications:
  antihistamines and/or decongestants). K-means cluster analysis (Jaccard method)
  was used to group 13 peripheral blood cytokines into 3 clusters to facilitate functional
  determination. We fitted multivariate logistic regressions to correlate PM2.5 exposure
  with presence of rhinitis, controlling for confounders, and then determined the
  role of cytokines in this relationship. Results: Long- (but not short-) term exposure
  to PM2.5 was associated with presence of rhinitis: 3-year exposure window, odds
  ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98, 1.80, per 1 standard deviation
  (SD) PM2.5 increase. Inclusion of cytokine cluster in the model led to a modestly
  stronger effect of PM2.5 exposure on rhinitis (OR = 1.37; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.87; 3-year
  exposure window). The particular immune profile responsible for this result was
  composed of elevated IL-3, IL-12, and IFN-γ (OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.10, 21.58, immune
  profile-PM2.5 exposure interaction term). Conclusion: We show for the first time
  that IL-3, IL-12, and IFN-γ explain in part the relationship between PM2.5 exposure
  and rhinitis in older US adults. If confirmed, these immune pathways may be used
  as therapeutic targets.'
