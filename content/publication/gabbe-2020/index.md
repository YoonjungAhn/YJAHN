abstract: Extreme heat is the leading weather-related cause of mortality in the United
  States, but there is little evidence about how this climate hazard affects residents
  of different housing types. In this study, we examine whether Californians living
  in subsidized housing are more vulnerable to extreme heat than those living in unsubsidized
  housing. We create a tract-level data set combining housing characteristics, downscaled
  climate projections, and an index of adaptive capacity and sensitivity to heat.
  We analyze exposure and vulnerability to heat by housing type and location. We find
  that subsidized housing is disproportionately located in the hottest tracts that
  simultaneously also have the most sensitive populations and barriers to adaptation
  (high-high tracts). Whereas 8% of Californiaâ€™s housing units are in high-high tracts,
  these tracts contain 16% of public housing units, 14% of Low-Income Housing Tax
  Credit units, and 10% of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. Our findings indicate
  the need for targeted housing and land-use policy interventions to reduce heat vulnerability.
