abstract: Cycling and walking are promoted as means of transportation which can contribute
  to the reduction of traffic pollution in urban areas. However, cyclists and pedestrians
  may be exposed to high concentrations of air pollutants due to their proximity to
  vehicle emissions. Commercial face mask respirators are widely used, in both developing
  and developed countries, as an individual protective measure against particle pollution.
  However scientific data on the efficacy of face mask respirators in reducing airborne
  particle exposure is limited. In this study, a custom experimental set-up was developed
  in order to measure the effectiveness of nine different respirators under real environmental
  conditions in terms of particle mass concentration below 2.5 μm (PM2.5), particle
  number concentration (PNC), Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA) and Black Carbon
  concentration (BC). Face mask performances were assessed in a typical traffic affected
  urban background environment in the city of Barcelona under three different simulated
  breathing rates to investigate the influence of flow rate. Results showed a median
  face mask effectiveness for PM2.5 equal to 48% in a range of 14–96%, 19% in a range
  of 6%–61% for BC concentration, 19% in a range of 4%–63% for PNC and 22% in a range
  of 5%–65% for LDSA. For each pollutant under investigation, the best performance
  was found always with the same mask (N7) although it is not the most expensive (in
  a range of price of 1 to 44, its cost was 20 euros), which has a filter on the entire
  surface except for the 2 exhalation valves where air cannot enter but just exit
  and shows a good fit on the dummy head.
