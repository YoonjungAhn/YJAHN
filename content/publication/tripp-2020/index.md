abstract: Exertional heat stroke is one of the top three causes of death in young
  athletes, particularly high school football players. Despite evidence that these
  deaths are completely avoidable with appropriate prevention and treatment, deaths
  still occur at an alarming rate. Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is the preferred
  method of both the National Athletic Trainers’ Association and American College
  of Sports Medicine to measure heat intensity. Based on the WBGT, activity modification
  guidelines (AMG) dictate work-to-rest ratios, activity levels and duration, protective
  equipment worn, and length and frequency of hydration breaks. Due to the cost of
  handheld WBGT monitors, smartphone apps that estimate WBGT have been considered
  an alternative. However, it is unclear how WBGT values estimated by these smartphone
  apps compare to those measured on-site using handheld WBGT monitors. We compared
  WBGT values estimated by a commercial smartphone app to those taken on-site at the
  same time and place. Thirteen athletic trainers measured WBGT in the field during
  high school football practices over a three-month season in North Central Florida.
  A paired sample t-test indicated the smartphone app significantly overestimated
  WBGT (29.0°C ± 4.1°C) compared to on-site measures (26.4°C ± 3.2°C) (r =0.580; t(943)=-23.38,
  p <0.0001). The smartphone app-estimated values were consistently greater than on-site
  measures, resulting in potentially unnecessary activity modifications and cancellations
  if the app was used in place of on-site handheld WBGT monitors. Despite being significantly
  cheaper than handheld WBGT monitors, at this time, smartphone apps are not ready
  for widespread use to guide activity modification decisions.
