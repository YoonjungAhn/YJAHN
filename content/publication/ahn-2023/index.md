abstract: This study emphasizes the critical role of air conditioning (AC) in preventing heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. The challenge of limited geographic
coverage and outdated AC availability data hampers eﬀective heat risk mapping and prevention eﬀorts. We identiﬁed areas with signiﬁcant AC needs and examined factors related to AC ownership in Florida, U.S. Local Indicators of Spatial Association results displayed distinct AC ownership disparities, with high-high clusters in coastal and metropolitan areas and AC-deﬁcient lusters inland. Vulnerable urban communities, predominantly inhabited by marginalized groups, had limited to no AC availability. The Spatial Durbin Model results revealed a signiﬁcant correlation between AC ownership and socioeconomic and urban factors. Notably, a higher proportion of AC-deﬁcient households were in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, underscoring racial disparities in AC ownership. These ﬁndings provide valuable insights for targeted interventions to mitigate heat-related risks and adapt to evolving climate conditions in vulnerable neighborhoods.
