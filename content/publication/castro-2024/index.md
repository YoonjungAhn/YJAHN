abstract: 'Background: Redlining has been associated with worse health outcomes and
  various environmental disparities, separately, but little is known of the interaction
  between these two factors, if any. We aimed to estimate whether living in a historically-redlined
  area modifies the effects of exposures to ambient PM2.5 and extreme heat on mortality
  by non-external causes. Methods: We merged 8,884,733 adult mortality records from
  thirteen state departments of public health with scanned and georeferenced Home
  Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) maps from the University of Richmond, daily average
  PM2.5 from a sophisticated prediction model on a 1-km grid, and daily temperature
  and vapor pressure from the Daymet V4 1-km grid. A case-crossover approach was used
  to assess modification of the effects of ambient PM2.5 and extreme heat exposures
  by redlining and control for all fixed and slow-varying factors by design. Multiple
  moving averages of PM2.5 and duration-aware analyses of extreme heat were used to
  assess the most vulnerable time windows. Results: We found significant statistical
  interactions between living in a redlined area and exposures to both ambient PM2.5
  and extreme heat. Individuals who lived in redlined areas had an interaction odds
  ratio for mortality of 1.0093 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0084, 1.0101) for
  each 10 µg m−3 increase in same-day ambient PM2.5 compared to individuals who did
  not live in redlined areas. For extreme heat, the interaction odds ratio was 1.0218
  (95% CI 1.0031, 1.0408). Conclusions: Living in areas that were historically-redlined
  in the 1930’s increases the effects of exposures to both PM2.5 and extreme heat
  on mortality by non-external causes, suggesting that interventions to reduce environmental
  health disparities can be more effective by also considering the social context
  of an area and how to reduce disparities there. Further study is required to ascertain
  the specific pathways through which this effect modification operates and to develop
  interventions that can contribute to health equity for individuals living in these
  areas.'
