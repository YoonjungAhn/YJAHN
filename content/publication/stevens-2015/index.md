abstract: High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are
  vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions
  and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census
  data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets.
  We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed
  census and ancillary data in a flexible, \"Random Forest\" estimation technique.
  We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data
  that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest
  model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at âˆ¼100 m spatial resolution.
  This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric
  redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare
  the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya)
  with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the
  advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of
  those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended
  to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin
  America.
