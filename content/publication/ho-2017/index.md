abstract: Extreme hot weather events are likely to increase under future climate change,
  and it is exacerbated in urban areas due to the complex urban settings. It causes
  excess mortality due to prolonged exposure to such extreme heat. However, there
  is lack of universal definition of prolonged heat or heat wave, which leads to inadequacies
  of associated risk preparedness. Previous studies focused on estimating temperature-mortality
  relationship based on temperature thresholds for assessing heat-related health risks
  but only several studies investigated the association between types of prolonged
  heat and excess mortality. However, most studies focused on one or a few isolated
  heat waves, which cannot demonstrate typical scenarios that population has experienced.
  In addition, there are limited studies on the difference between daytime and nighttime
  temperature, resulting in insufficiency to conclude the effect of prolonged heat.
  In sub-tropical high-density cities where prolonged heat is common in summer, it
  is important to obtain a comprehensive understanding of prolonged heat for a complete
  assessment of heat-related health risks. In this study, six types of prolonged heat
  were examined by using a time-stratified analysis. We found that more consecutive
  hot nights contribute to higher mortality risk while the number of consecutive hot
  days does not have significant association with excess mortality. For a day after
  five consecutive hot nights, there were 7.99% [7.64%, 8.35%], 7.74% [6.93%, 8.55%],
  and 8.14% [7.38%, 8.88%] increases in all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory
  mortality, respectively. Non-consecutive hot days or nights are also found to contribute
  to short-term mortality risk. For a 7-day-period with at least five non-consecutive
  hot days and nights, there was 15.61% [14.52%, 16.70%] increase in all-cause mortality
  at lag 0–1, but only −2.00% [−2.83%, −1.17%] at lag 2–3. Differences in the temperature-mortality
  relationship caused by hot days and hot nights imply the need to categorize prolonged
  heat for public health surveillance. Findings also contribute to potential improvement
  to existing heat-health warning system.
