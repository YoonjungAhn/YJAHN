abstract: Mounting evidence over the past several decades has demonstrated inequitable
  distribution of pollutants of ambient origin between sociodemographic groups in
  the United States. Most environmental inequality studies to date are cross-sectional
  and used proximity-based methods rather than modeled air pollution concentrations,
  limiting the ability to examine trends over time or the factors that drive exposure
  inequalities. In this paper, we use 1km2 modeled PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations in
  Massachusetts over an 8-year period and Census demographic data to quantify inequality
  between sociodemographic groups and to develop a more nuanced understanding of the
  drivers and trends in longitudinal air pollution inequality. Annual-average population-weighted
  PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were highest for urban non-Hispanic black populations
  (11.8µg/m3 in 2003 and 8.4µg/m3 in 2010, vs. 11.3µg/m3 and 8.1µg/m3 for urban non-Hispanic
  whites) and urban Hispanic populations (15.9 ppb in 2005 and 13.0 ppb in 2010, vs.
  13.0 ppb and 10.2 ppb for urban non-Hispanic whites), respectively. While population
  groups experienced similar absolute decreases in exposure over time, disparities
  in population-weighted concentrations increased over time when quantified by the
  Atkinson Index, a relative inequality measure. Exposure inequalities were approximately
  one order of magnitude greater for NO2 compared to PM2.5, were more pronounced in
  urban compared to rural geographies, and between racial/ethnic groups compared to
  income and educational attainment groups. Our results also revealed similar longitudinal
  PM2.5 and NO2 inequality trends using Census 2000 and Census 2010 data, indicating
  that spatio-temporal shifts in air pollution may best explain observed trends in
  inequality. These findings enhance our understanding of factors that contribute
  to persistent inequalities and underscore the importance of targeted exposure reduction
  strategies aimed at vulnerable populations and neighborhoods.
