abstract: Golf is a recreation industry particularly sensitive to climate, yet the
  potential implications of climate change for the industry remain largely unexamined.
  This study presents findings of the first known impact assessment to compare the
  regional impacts of projected changes in the climate on the golf industry in Canada
  (or internationally). Empirical relationships between daily rounds played and four
  weather variables were defined through multiple regression analysis and then used
  to examine the potential impacts of two climate change scenarios on the length of
  the golf season and the number of rounds played in three regions of Canada (West
  Coast, Great Lakes, East Coast). Regionally, the West Coast region was projected
  to benefit the least from projected climate change, as golf courses that are currently
  open year round experienced only slight projected increases in rounds played in
  the 2020s and 2050s. Golf courses in the Great Lakes region could experience a 10-
  to 51-day longer average golf season and a 21 percent to 3 percent increase in rounds
  as early as the 2020s, and an even more pronounced increase in the 2050s. East Coast
  golf courses were projected to benefit the most under both climate change scenarios,
  experiencing larger gains in average operating seasons (25 to 45 days in the 2020s)
  and a 40 percent to 48 percent increase in rounds played by as early as the 2020s.
