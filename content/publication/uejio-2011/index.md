abstract: Extreme heat is an important weather hazard associated with excess mortality
  and morbidity. We determine the relative importance of heat exposure and the built
  environment, socioeconomic vulnerability, and neighborhood stability for heat mortality
  (Philadelphia, PA, USA) or heat distress (Phoenix, AZ, USA), using an ecologic study
  design. We use spatial Generalized Linear and Mixed Models to account for non-independence
  (spatial autocorrelation) between neighboring census block groups. Failing to account
  for spatial autocorrelation can provide misleading statistical results. Phoenix
  neighborhoods with more heat exposure, Black, Hispanic, linguistically and socially
  isolated residents, and vacant households made more heat distress calls. Philadelphia
  heat mortality neighborhoods were more likely to have low housing values and a higher
  proportion of Black residents. Our methodology can identify important risk factors
  and geographic areas to target interventions.
