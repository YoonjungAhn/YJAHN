abstract: In this study 320 people in Hong Kong were interviewed to assess their understanding
  and perception of severe weather warnings. The majority of the respondents (72%)
  received warnings from mass media. Although 99.4% of the interviewees claimed they
  knew all the warning signals, results indicate that most of them have only a basic
  understanding of what they mean. The study revealed that the warnings often lack
  other important information, such as the time of issue, validity period and precautions
  to be taken. Only 31% of the respondents stated they would take precautions at the
  issue of warnings, although people aged over 60 tended to be well prepared for the
  onset of severe weather. Public education is necessary to promote people's understanding
  of the warnings and awareness of the risks of severe weather.
