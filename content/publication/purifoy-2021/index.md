abstract: '<p>This article interrogates the “anomalous” case of Black-founded towns,
  so-called because of their relative absence from discourse on Black place, their
  unique struggles for self-determined development, and their externally ascribed
  narratives of absent or dysfunctional governance, frequently invoked to explain
  their lack of access to basic infrastructure. We propose illuminating some of these
  so-called anomalies through Charles Mills’ “racial contract,” which we argue structures
  space at a deeper level than traditional legal arrangements and allows us to look
  relationally at Black towns in “white space.” We also rely on Cedric Robinson’s
  “racial capitalism” to demonstrate how white space develops through extraction of
  value from places racialized as nonwhite. Through the case of Tamina, Texas, we
  argue that Black towns specifically, and Black places more generally, experience
  racially predatory governance and resource extraction, often by nearby white places,
  under the guise of following mundane rules of legal jurisdiction, standard economic
  planning, and development. To illustrate this, we focus on three overlapping mechanisms
  of “creative extraction” that reinforce white spatial, political, and economic power
  at the expense of Black places: theft, erosion, and exclusion. These mechanisms
  are tied to the environmental harms inflicted on Black towns, as some of the existential
  threats they face.</p>'
