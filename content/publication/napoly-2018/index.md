abstract: In urban areas, dense atmospheric observational networks with high-quality
  data are still a challenge due to high costs for installation and maintenance over
  time. Citizen weather stations (CWS) could be one answer to that issue. Since more
  and more owners of CWS share their measurement data publicly, crowdsourcing, i.e.,
  the automated collection of large amounts of data from an undefined crowd of citizens,
  opens new pathways for atmospheric research. However, the most critical issue is
  found to be the quality of data from such networks. In this study, a statistically-based
  quality control (QC) is developed to identify suspicious air temperature (T) measurements
  from crowdsourced data sets. The newly developed QC exploits the combined knowledge
  of the dense network of CWS to statistically identify implausible measurements,
  independent of external reference data. The evaluation of the QC is performed using
  data from Netatmo CWS in Toulouse, France, and Berlin, Germany, over a 1-year period
  (July 2016 to June 2017), comparing the quality-controlled data with data from two
  networks of reference stations. The new QC efficiently identifies erroneous data
  due to solar exposition and siting issues, which are common error sources of CWS.
  Estimation of T is improved when averaging data from a group of stations within
  a restricted area rather than relying on data of individual CWS. However, a positive
  deviation in CWS data compared to reference data is identified, particularly for
  daily minimum T. To illustrate the transferability of the newly developed QC and
  the applicability of CWS data, a mapping of T is performed over the city of Paris,
  France, where spatial density of CWS is especially high.
