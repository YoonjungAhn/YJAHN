abstract: The United States spends more on health care than any other OECD country,
  yet the nation’s health is declining. Recent research has identified multiple sources
  for this decline, including one’s position in social and economic structures, environmental
  quality, and individual and collective social capital. This paper assesses the primary
  hypotheses that the health effects of household energy burden, social capital and
  environmental quality on aggregated community health levels remain while controlling
  for other determinants. The analysis moves beyond prior research by integrating
  multiple secondary data sources to assess those effects across US counties. Three
  indicators of public health are analyzed (premature mortality, self-reported health,
  and life expectancy). The county-level energy burden is measured by the percent
  of household income spent on housing energy bills for low-and moderate-income households.
  In addition to energy burden, social capital, environmental quality and other determinants
  are included in the analysis. The results produced by multivariate regression models
  support the primary hypotheses, even while a number of control variables also have
  a significant effect on health. The paper concludes that public health is associated
  with a complex nexus of factors, including environmental quality and social capital,
  and that energy burden needs to be among the considerations.
