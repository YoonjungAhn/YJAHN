abstract: Over the coming century, climate change is projected to increase both mean
  and extreme temperatures as heat waves become more frequent, intense, and long-lived.
  The city of Chicago has already experienced a number of severe heat waves, with
  a 1995 event estimated to be responsible for nearly 800 deaths. Here, future projections
  under SRES higher (A1FI) and lower (B1) emission scenarios are used to estimate
  the frequency of 1995-like heat wave events in terms of both meteorological characteristics
  and impacts on heat-related mortality. Before end of century, 1995-like heat waves
  could occur every other year on average under lower emissions and as frequently
  as three times per year under higher. Annual average mortality rates are projected
  to equal those of 1995 under lower emissions and reach twice 1995 levels under higher.
  An \"analog city\" analysis, transposing the weather conditions from the European
  Heat Wave of 2003 (responsible for 70,000 deaths across Europe) to the city of Chicago,
  estimates that if a similar heat wave were to occur over Chicago, more than ten
  times the annual average number of heat-related deaths could occur in just a few
  weeks. Climate projections indicate that an EHW-type heat wave could occur in Chicago
  by mid-century. Between mid-and end-of-century, there could be as many as five such
  events under lower, and twenty-five under higher emissions. These results highlight
  the importance of both preventive mitigation and responsive adaptation strategies
  in reducing the vulnerability of Chicago's population to climate change-induced
  increases in extreme heat.
