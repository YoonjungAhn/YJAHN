abstract: "Current knowledge about potential interactions between socioeconomic status
  and the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on mortality was reviewed.
  A systematic search of the Medline database through April 2006 extracted detailed
  information about exposure measures, socioeconomic indicators, subjects' characteristics
  and principal results. Fifteen articles (time series, case-crossover, cohort) examined
  short-term effects. The variety of socioeconomic indicators studied made formal
  comparisons difficult. One striking fact emerged: studies using socioeconomic characteristics
  measured at coarser geographic resolutions (city- or county-wide) found no effect
  modification, but those using finer geographic resolutions found mixed results,
  and five of six studies using individually-measured socioeconomic characteristics
  found that pollution affected disadvantaged subjects more. This finding was echoed
  by the six studies of long-term effects (cohorts) identified; these had substantial
  methodological differences, which we discuss extensively. Current evidence does
  not yet justify a definitive conclusion that socioeconomic characteristics modify
  the effects of air pollution on mortality. Nevertheless, existing results, most
  tending to show greater effects among the more deprived, emphasise the importance
  of continuing to investigate this topic."
