abstract: In this paper, an estimation of the wind speed at different heights with
  artificial neural networks is presented. It is an alternative way to compute wind
  shear. This method was tested using pairs of data sets from two measuring stations,
  installed in different topographic locations. Wind speed simulation is performed
  with high accuracy. The calculation of the surface friction coefficient from the
  actual measurements is also compared for wind shear estimation with the typical
  method in terms of energy output. Results showed that artificial neural networks
  achieve a better wind speed simulation and wind power estimation at different heights,
  even in complex terrains.
