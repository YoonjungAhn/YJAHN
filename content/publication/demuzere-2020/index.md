abstract: Although continental urban areas are relatively small, they are major drivers
  of environmental change at local, regional and global scales. Moreover, they are
  especially vulnerable to these changes owing to the concentration of population
  and their exposure to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards, emphasizing the need
  for spatially detailed information on urbanized landscapes. These data need to be
  consistent in content and scale and provide a holistic description of urban layouts
  to address different user needs. Here, we map the continental United States into
  Local Climate Zone (LCZ) types at a 100 m spatial resolution using expert and crowd-sourced
  information. There are 10 urban LCZ types, each associated with a set of relevant
  variables such that the map represents a valuable database of urban properties.
  These data are benchmarked against continental-wide existing and novel geographic
  databases on urban form. We anticipate the dataset provided here will be useful
  for researchers and practitioners to assess how the configuration, size, and shape
  of cities impact the important human and environmental outcomes.
