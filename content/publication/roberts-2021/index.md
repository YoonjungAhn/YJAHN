abstract: ABSTRACT Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a true medical emergency with potential
  for organ injury and death. This consensus statement emphasizes that optimal exertional
  heat illness management is promoted by a synchronized chain of survival that promotes
  rapid recognition and management, as well as communication between care teams. Health
  care providers should be confident in the definitions, etiologies, and nuances of
  exertional heat exhaustion, exertional heat injury, and EHS. Identifying the athlete
  with suspected EHS early in the course, stopping activity (body heat generation),
  and providing rapid total body cooling are essential for survival, and like any
  critical life-threatening situation (cardiac arrest, brain stroke, sepsis), time
  is tissue. Recovery from EHS is variable, and outcomes are likely related to the
  duration of severe hyperthermia. Most exertional heat illnesses can be prevented
  with the recognition and modification of well-described risk factors ideally addressed
  through leadership, policy, and on-site health care.
