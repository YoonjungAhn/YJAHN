abstract: "The study of geography as a discipline has often employed a top-down approach
  that examines the output of the field's most prominent members. In this paper, we
  provide a bottom-up approach by analyzing geography dissertations. We start by assembling
  a database that includes the title, author, date, and university for every geographic
  doctoral dissertation written in the United States over the last 120 years. The
  database allows us to track the rise and fall of regions of interest and specific
  topics. It gives a broad overview of the different schools in geography and their
  influence within separate historical periods. And it permits a more empirically
  based delineation of geo-graphical \\\" eras \\\" based on the commonality of words
  in dissertation titles. This work is at the convergence of the quantitative and
  qualitative; we quantify and visualize textual data to provide a more robust history
  of geography. The result is a new, more compre-hensive way to look at the changing
  discipline of geography. Keywords: history of geogra-phy, textual analysis, dissertations,
  digital humanities. The essence of contemporary geography—its disciplinary DNA—is
  bound up in its connections to the past: rich branches of a growing family tree
  of Ph.D.s, advisors, and institutional homes. Many trace how we arrived at the current
  state of our discipline. These histories describe shifting paradigms (James and
  Martin, 1993), subfields (Gaile and Wilmott 2003), or geography's \\\" key think-ers
  \\\" and their representation of, and influence on, the discipline as it changed
  over time (Johnston and Sidaway, 2004). Recounting of core geographical debates
  and profiles of prominent geogra-phers can be quite useful. But at the same time,
  it is an elite exercise in which changes in geography are examined from the standpoint
  of its most outstand-ing participants. Characterizing the trends in geography from
  the bottom up— witnessing the interests of the emergent junior cadre of geographers
  – is an equally if not more valuable endeavor. In this paper we expand current under-standings
  of the institutional and disciplinary nature of geography, and its change over time
  by examining the over 10,000 dissertations produced during the 120+ years that geography
  has been a doctoral-level discipline in the United States. A digital humanities
  approach to the history of the discipline allows us to examine this large database
  of Ph.D. production. We argue that dissertations offer a broad view of the field,
  which allow us to track the overall output of geographical scholarship by university,
  take into account the different eras of geography based on dissertation topics,
  chart *We would like to acknowledge Mark Revell at the Association of American Geographers
  for providing us with some of the data on dissertations. We also thank Kelly Turner
  for reading over our manuscript and making several helpful suggestions."
