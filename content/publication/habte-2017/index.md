abstract: This paper validates the performance of the physics-based Physical Solar
  Model (PSM) data set in the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB) to quantify
  the accuracy of the magnitude and the spatial and temporal variability of the solar
  radiation data. Achieving higher penetrations of solar energy on the electric grid
  and reducing integration costs requires accurate knowledge of the available solar
  resource. Understanding the impacts of clouds and other meteorological constituents
  on the solar resource and quantifying intra-/inter-hour, seasonal, and interannual
  variability are essential for accurately designing utility-scale solar energy projects.
  Solar resource information can be obtained from ground-based measurement stations
  and/or from modeled data sets. The availability of measurements is scarce, both
  temporally and spatially, because it is expensive to maintain a high-density solar
  radiation measurement network that collects good quality data for long periods of
  time. On the other hand, high temporal and spatial resolution gridded satellite
  data can be used to estimate surface radiation for long periods of time and is extremely
  useful for solar energy development. Because of the advantages of satellite-based
  solar resource assessment, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory developed the
  PSM. The PSM produced gridded solar irradiance -- global horizontal irradiance (GHI),
  direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse horizontal irradiance -- for the NSRDB
  at a 4-km by 4-km spatial resolution and half-hourly temporal resolution covering
  the 18 years from 1998-2015. The NSRDB also contains additional ancillary meteorological
  data sets, such as temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure, dew point,
  and wind speed. Details of the model and data are available at https://nsrdb.nrel.gov.
