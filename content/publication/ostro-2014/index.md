abstract: 'Background: Several cohort studies report associations between chronic
  exposure to ambient fine particles (PM2.5) and cardiovascular mortality. Uncertainty
  exists about biological mechanisms responsible for this observation, but systemic
  inflammation has been postulated. In addition, the subgroups susceptible to inflammation
  have not been fully elucidated. Methods: We investigated whether certain subgroups
  are susceptible to the effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5 on C-reactive protein
  (CRP), a marker of inflammation directly linked to subsequent cardiovascular disease.
  We used data from the SWAN cohort of 1923 mid-life women with up to five annual
  repeated measures of CRP. Linear mixed and GEE models accounting for repeated measurements
  within an individual were used to estimate the effects of prior-year PM2.5 exposure
  on CRP. We examined CRP as a continuous and as binary outcome for CRP greater than
  3. mg/l, a level of clinical significance. Results: We found strong associations
  between PM2.5 and CRP among several subgroups. For example a 10μg/m3 increase in
  annual PM2.5 more than doubled the risk of CRP greater than 3mg/l in older diabetics,
  smokers and the unmarried. Larger effects were also observed among those with low
  income, high blood pressure, or who were using hormone therapy, with indications
  of a protective effects for those using statins or consuming moderate amounts of
  alcohol. Conclusions: In this study, we observed significant associations between
  long-term exposure to PM2.5 and CRP in several susceptible subgroups. This suggests
  a plausible pathway by which exposure to particulate matter may be associated with
  increased risk of cardiovascular disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.'
