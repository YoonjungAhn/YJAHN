abstract: Adaptive comfort standards have been gaining wider acceptance and are now
  considered an integral part of main stream comfort research. Several adaptive comfort
  equations have been developed, some as part of international comfort standards and
  some for specific climatic regions. In the current work, an attempt was made to
  find a best fit among available comfort equations for predicting occupant comfort
  in the tropical climatic regions of India. Comfort temperatures found in surveys
  done across tropical India were compared to comfort temperatures computed from five
  different adaptive comfort equations. Additionally, to estimate energy savings possible
  through implementation of adaptive comfort standards, adaptive comfort degree days
  (ACDD) were calculated across seven Indian cities using comfort temperature predictions
  from the five equations. Put together, results from these two analyses showed that
  the comfort equation from EN15251 may be used as a reasonable predictor of comfort
  in naturally ventilated buildings of hot-humid Indian regions and such use would
  also result in major energy savings. It is proposed that till further studies in
  India provide more detailed results, the EN15251's standard for naturally ventilated
  buildings may be used as a suitable option for Indian conditions. Formalisation
  of appropriate adaptive comfort standards for India would be a significant asset
  to the sustainable development of this country.
