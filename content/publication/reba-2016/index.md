abstract: How were cities distributed globally in the past? How many people lived
  in these cities? How did cities influence their local and regional environments?
  In order to understand the current era of urbanization, we must understand long-Term
  historical urbanization trends and patterns. However, to date there is no comprehensive
  record of spatially explicit, historic, city-level population data at the global
  scale. Here, we developed the first spatially explicit dataset of urban settlements
  from 3700 BC to AD 2000, by digitizing, transcribing, and geocoding historical,
  archaeological, and census-based urban population data previously published in tabular
  form by Chandler and Modelski. The dataset creation process also required data cleaning
  and harmonization procedures to make the data internally consistent. Additionally,
  we created a reliability ranking for each geocoded location to assess the geographic
  uncertainty of each data point. The dataset provides the first spatially explicit
  archive of the location and size of urban populations over the last 6,000 years
  and can contribute to an improved understanding of contemporary and historical urbanization
  trends.
