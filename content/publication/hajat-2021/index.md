abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Despite a vast air pollution epidemiology literature to date
  and the recognition that lower-socioeconomic status (SES) populations are often
  disproportionately exposed to pollution, there is little research identifying optimal
  means of adjusting for confounding by SES in air pollution epidemiology, nor is
  there a strong understanding of biases that may result from improper adjustment.
  OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a conceptualization of SES and a review of approaches
  to its measurement in the U.S. context and discuss pathways by which SES may influence
  health and confound effects of air pollution. We explore bias related to measurement
  and operationalization and identify statistical approaches to reduce bias and confounding.
  DISCUSSION: Drawing on the social epidemiology, health geography, and economic literatures,
  we describe how SES, a multifaceted construct operating through myriad pathways,
  may be conceptualized and operationalized in air pollution epidemiology studies.
  SES varies across individuals within the contexts of place, time, and culture. Although
  no single variable or index can fully capture SES, many studies rely on only a single
  measure. We recommend examining multiple facets of SES appropriate to the study
  design. Furthermore, investigators should carefully consider the multiple mechanisms
  by which SES might be operating to identify those SES indicators that may be most
  appropriate for a given context or study design and assess the impact of improper
  adjustment on air pollution effect estimates. Last, exploring model contraction
  and expansion methods may enrich adjustment, whereas statistical approaches, such
  as quantitative bias analysis, may be used to evaluate residual confounding. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7980'
