abstract: Gridded population distribution data are finding increasing use in a wide
  range of fields, including resource allocation, disease burden estimation and climate
  change impact assessment. Land cover information can be used in combination with
  detailed settlement extents to redistribute aggregated census counts to improve
  the accuracy of national-scale gridded population data. In East Africa, such analyses
  have been done using regional land cover data, thus restricting application of the
  approach to this region. If gridded population data are to be improved across Africa,
  an alternative, consistent and comparable source of land cover data is required.
  Here these analyses were repeated for Kenya using four continent-wide land cover
  datasets combined with detailed settlement extents and accuracies were assessed
  against detailed census data. The aim was to identify the large area land cover
  dataset that, combined with detailed settlement extents, produce the most accurate
  population distribution data. The effectiveness of the population distribution modelling
  procedures in the absence of high resolution census data was evaluated, as was the
  extrapolation ability of population densities between different regions. Results
  showed that the use of the GlobCover dataset refined with detailed settlement extents
  provided significantly more accurate gridded population data compared to the use
  of refined AVHRR-derived, MODIS-derived and GLC2000 land cover datasets. This study
  supports the hypothesis that land cover information is important for improving population
  distribution model accuracies, particularly in countries where only coarse resolution
  census data are available. Obtaining high resolution census data must however remain
  the priority. With its higher spatial resolution and its more recent data acquisition,
  the GlobCover dataset was found as the most valuable resource to use in combination
  with detailed settlement extents for the production of gridded population datasets
  across large areas. Â© 2010 The Author(s).
