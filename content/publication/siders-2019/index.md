abstract: 'Adaptive capacity is an important element of long-term adaptation to climate
  change and is the focus of a rapidly growing body of research. Interdisciplinary
  growth has the potential to introduce new methods and insights, but it could also
  cause fragmentation and hamper methodological development or limit transfer of academic
  insights to climate change adaptation practice. This article uses qualitative content,
  bibliometric, and citation network analyses to systematically review the scope,
  methods, and findings of 276 studies on adaptive capacity of social and social-ecological
  systems. The review demonstrates that adaptive capacity research is highly interdisciplinary;
  covers a wide range of sectors, geographic locations, and scales of analysis; and
  is highly fragmented. The majority of empirical studies are isolated by lack of
  comparative work and cross-field citation. Forty-six percent of studies reviewed
  do not cite prior works on adaptive capacity: even those on similar topics in the
  same geographic location. Methods to assess adaptive capacity have proliferated
  to include more than 64 indicator-based indices or frameworks and 37 proxy outcome
  measures. The article argues that lack of either consensus or debate across the
  literature raises concerns that scientific progress in the field may be constrained
  and the ability of adaptive capacity research to inform adaptation practice may
  be limited. To promote consistency and transparency in future work, 158 determinants
  of adaptive capacity are defined and illustrated with common assessment indicators
  and examples. Additional opportunities for progress are noted with suggestions for
  future research. This article is categorized under: Vulnerability and Adaptation
  to Climate Change > Institutions for Adaptation.'
