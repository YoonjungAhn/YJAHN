abstract: Extreme heat is a natural hazard that could rapidly increase in magnitude
  in the 21st century. The combination of increasing urbanization, growing numbers
  of vulnerable people, and the evidence of global warming indicate an urgent need
  for improved heat-wave mitigation and response systems. A review of the literature
  on heat-wave impacts in urban environments and on human health reveals opportunities
  for improved synthesis, integration, and sharing of information resources that relate
  to the spatial and temporal nature of threats posed by extreme heat. This paper
  illustrates how geospatial technologies can aid in the mitigation of urban heat
  waves.
