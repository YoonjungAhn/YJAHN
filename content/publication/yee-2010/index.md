abstract: Classical categorical regression models such as the multinomial logit and
  proportional odds models are shown to be readily handled by the vector generalized
  linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) framework. Additionally, there are natural
  extensions, such as reduced-rank VGLMs for dimension reduction, and allowing covariates
  that have values specific to each linear/additive predictor, e.g., for consumer
  choice modeling. This article describes some of the framework behind the VGAM R
  package, its usage and implementation details.
