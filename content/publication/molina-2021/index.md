abstract: Understanding space–time features of wind speed is of high interest in meteorology
  and several applied sciences. Accurate wind speed measurements in combination with
  reliable gridded products, such as reanalyses, are needed to address the main characteristics
  of the wind field. Hourly 10 m wind speed from the European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) latest reanalysis (ERA5) is compared with HadISD wind
  observations from 245 stations across Europe. Averaged ERA5 hourly data is able
  to reproduce the annual cycle of monthly wind speed in Europe. ERA5 presents slightly
  larger (shorter) monthly medians in winter (summer) than observations. ERA5 is compared
  against observations for each station using a frequency distribution-based score
  (score, from 0 to 1). Most of the stations exhibit hourly scores ranging from 0.8
  to 0.9, indicating that ERA5 is able to reproduce the wind speed spectrum range,
  from light to strong relative frequencies, for any location over Europe. Ranges
  of mean values, variability, distribution function parameters and high or low wind
  thresholds frequencies are shown for this ensemble of European stations, allowing
  for an overall description of wind features. Generally, there is no clear relationship
  between scores and the variables analysed. The correlation and scores between ERA5
  and HadISD is even further increased at longer time frequencies (6–24 hourly), together
  with centred root-mean-square error (RMSE) and standard deviation decreases. Hourly
  wind data from ERA5 reanalysis is, despite some shortcomings, valuable information
  to perform further detailed studies with a regular spatial and time wind distribution,
  from the climatological or renewable energy perspectives, for example.
