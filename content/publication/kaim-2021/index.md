abstract: We produced a reconstruction of mid-19th-century building structure locations
  in former Galicia and Austrian Silesia (parts of the Habsburg Monarchy), which are
  located in present-day Czechia, Poland, and Ukraine and cover more than 80 000 km2.
  Our reconstruction was based on a homogeneous series of detailed Second Military
  Survey maps (1 V 28 800) that were the result of a cadastral mapping (1 V 2880)
  generalization. The dataset consists of two types of building structures based on
  the original map legend-residential and outbuildings (mainly farm-related buildings).
  The dataset's accuracy was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively by using independent
  data sources and may serve as an important input in studying long-Term socioeconomic
  processes and human-environmental interactions or as a valuable reference for continental
  settlement reconstructions. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.17632/md8jp9ny9z.2
  (Kaim et al., 2020a).
