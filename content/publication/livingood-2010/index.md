abstract: Introduction Diabetes rates continue to grow in the United States. Effectively
  addressing the epidemic requires better understanding of the distribution of disease
  and the geographic clustering of factors that influence it. Variations in the prevalence
  of diabetes at the local level are largely unreported, making understanding the
  disparities associated with the disease more difficult. Diabetes death rates during
  the past 15 years in Duval County, Florida, have been disproportionately high compared
  with the rest of the state. Methods We analyzed multiple sources of secondary data
  related to diabetes illness and death in Duval County, including data on hospital
  discharge, emergency department (ED) use, and vital statistics. We accessed diabetes
  and diabetes-related ED use and hospitalization and death data by using codes from
  the International Classification of Diseases versions 9 and 10. We analyzed data
  from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey for Duval County and
  adapted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weighting formulas for subcounty
  analysis. We used relative risk-type disease ratios and geographic information systems
  mapping to analyze data. Results The urban, mostly minority, low-socioeconomic area
  of Duval County had twice the rate of diabetes-related illness and death as other
  areas of the county, and the inner-city, poor area of the county had almost 3 times
  the rate of hospitalization and ED use for diabetes and diabetes-related conditions
  compared with the other areas of the county. Conclusion Our analyses show that diabetes-related
  disparities affect not only people and their families but also the community that
  absorbs the costs associated with the disproportionate health care use that results
  from these disparities. Analyzing data at the subcounty level has implications for
  health care planning and public health policy development at the local level.
