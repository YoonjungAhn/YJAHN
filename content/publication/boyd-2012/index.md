abstract: "The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists,
  mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other
  scholars are clamouring for access to the massive quantities of information produced
  by and about people, things, and their interactions. Significant questions emerge.
  Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods?
  Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will
  data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or
  will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we
  study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options
  and alter what 'research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical
  phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions
  and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about
  the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that
  rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive
  utopian and dystopian rhetoric."
