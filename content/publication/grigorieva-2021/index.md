abstract: Association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory
  health is well documented. At the same time, it is widely known that extreme weather
  events intrinsically exacerbate air pollution impact. Particularly, hot weather
  and extreme temperatures during heat waves (HW) significantly affect human health,
  increasing risks of respiratory mortality and morbidity. Concurrently, a synergistic
  effect of air pollution and high temperatures can be combined with weather-air pollution
  interaction during wildfires. The purpose of the current review is to summarize
  literature on interplay of hot weather, air pollution, and respiratory health consequences
  worldwide, with the ultimate goal of identifying the most dangerous pollution agents
  and vulnerable population groups. A literature search was conducted using electronic
  databases Web of Science, Pubmed, Science Direct, and Scopus, focusing only on peer-reviewed
  journal articles published in English from 2000 to 2021. The main findings demonstrate
  that the increased level of PM10 and O3 results in significantly higher rates of
  respiratory and cardiopulmonary mortality. Increments in PM2.5 and PM10, O3, CO,
  and NO2 concentrations during high temperature episodes are dramatically associated
  with higher admissions to hospital in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease, daily hospital emergency transports for asthma, acute and chronic bronchitis,
  and premature mortality caused by respiratory disease. Excessive respiratory health
  risk is more pronounced in elderly cohorts and small children. Both heat waves and
  outdoor air pollution are synergistically linked and are expected to be more serious
  in the future due to greater climate instability, being a crucial threat to global
  public health that requires the responsible involvement of researchers at all levels.
  Sustainable urban planning and smart city design could significantly reduce both
  urban heat islands effect and air pollution.
