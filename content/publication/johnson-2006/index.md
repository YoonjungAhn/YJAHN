abstract: Compared to their urban counterparts, rural residents face numerous disparities
  in obtaining health care, including limited access to care providers. We assessed
  disparities in provider availability in rural versus urban Alaska and New Mexico,
  with emphasis on professionals likely to provide mental health care. Using lists
  of licenses, we categorized physical and mental health care providers into rural
  versus urban and calculated rural versus urban disparity ratios. Rural residents
  had significantly less access to health care providers and discrepancies grew with
  level of required provider education and specialization. Addressing disparities
  via creative strategies is crucial to improving rural care delivery. Â© 2005 Springer
