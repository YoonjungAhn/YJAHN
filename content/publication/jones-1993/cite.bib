 note = {many researchers study and recognized that the local, places, regional geography influence on health. this paper review the theme of 'local medical geography' and find a significant contribution of the regional medical geography studies and limitations of the these studies.<br/>This study mentioned research focus on 'space making a dffiference', usually find the generality in the data or test the validity of a general model at local level.These kind of studies are considered as deviation and accused of &quot;denying geographyer&quot;.<br/><br/>researchers used four different methods to solve the problems : first approach is looking at different towns.<br/>second approach is looking at one town and interal variations<br/>third approach is to see the effect after migration.<br/>fourth is national scale survey. However, there are four types of study that are sensitive to local differences which means hard to generalize and apply to other regions.<br/><br/>1.The author is arguing that we need to not only focus on the geography but also poeple.<br/>2.statistical analysis can't explain everything. sometimes it aggregate and some information can be dilluted by this. quantitative methods and qualitative methods should be considered.},
