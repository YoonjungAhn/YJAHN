abstract: Environmental heat is a growing public health concern in cities. Urbanization
  and global climate change threaten to exacerbate heat as an already significant
  environmental cause of human morbidity and mortality. Despite increasing risk, very
  little is known regarding determinants of outdoor urban heat exposure. To provide
  additional evidence for building community and national-scale resilience to extreme
  heat, we assess how US outdoor urban heat exposure varies by city, demography, and
  activity. We estimate outdoor urban heat exposure by pairing individual-level data
  from the American Time Use Survey (2004â€“2015) with corresponding meteorological
  data for 50 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the US. We also assess
  the intersection of activity intensity and heat exposure by pairing metabolic intensities
  with individual-level time-use data. We model an empirical relationship between
  demographic indicators and daily heat exposure with controls for spatiotemporal
  factors. We find higher outdoor heat exposure among the elderly and low-income individuals,
  and lower outdoor heat exposure in females, young adults, and those identifying
  as Black race. Traveling, lawn and garden care, and recreation are the most common
  outdoor activities to contribute to heat exposure. We also find individuals in cities
  with the most extreme temperatures do not necessarily have the highest outdoor heat
  exposure. The findings reveal large contrasts in outdoor heat exposure between different
  cities, demographic groups, and activities. Resolving the interplay between exposure,
  sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and behavior as determinants of heat-health risk
  will require advances in observational and modeling tools, especially at the individual
  scale.
