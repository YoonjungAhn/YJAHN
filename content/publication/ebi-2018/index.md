abstract: '1. Executive Summary The Deepwater Horizon spill released over 200 million
  gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico raising concerns for human health as well
  as ecological damage. As oil entered the Gulf of Mexico and inland waters, officials
  closed fishing areas to protect public health. Health assessment methodology provides
  a framework for the systematic analysis of the routes by which populations may be
  exposed to contaminants and the characterization of public health implications.
  This assessment provides a basis for decision making to protect public health and
  inform the public of the risks associated with the event. The two major pathways
  for exposure are the inhalation of volatile compounds and the consumption of oil-contaminated
  seafood. From a human health perspective, seafood is a possible route of human exposure
  if the fish or shellfish take up and accumulates contaminants in oil. Crude oil
  is composed of thousands of hydrocarbons and the composition begins to change, or
  \" weather \" , as soon as it enters the environment. Contaminants of concern in
  crude oil are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially the aromatic hydrocarbons,
  BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene). Inhalation is the primary route
  of exposure for the VOCs. The other major compounds of concern are the polycyclic
  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have the potential to be taken up by seafood
  that is consumed by people. PAHs are widespread in the environment and do not accumulate
  to any extent. Finfish and crustaceans metabolize PAHs and will breakdown and excrete
  any that are taken up; mollusks breakdown PAHs more slowly and can accumulate these
  compounds when the amount in the environment is high. Extensive testing must be
  conducted to reopen closed fishing areas. Federal and state agencies developed a
  seafood monitoring protocol for reopening of waters closed to fishing. The overall
  plan utilizes a three tiered screening approach: 1) No visible oil observed in the
  designated areas; 2) Organoleptic testing of the seafood; and 3) Chemical testing
  of the seafood. Sampling for organoleptic or chemical analysis occurs only in areas
  with no visible oil and under consideration for reopening. The seafood monitoring
  program is designed to test areas free of oil and under consideration for reopening.
  The tiered approach to sampling screens out areas with observable oil and uses the
  chemical analysis to confirm the seafood is free of contamination.'
