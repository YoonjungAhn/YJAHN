 abstract = {1. Executive Summary The Deepwater Horizon spill released over 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico raising concerns for human health as well as ecological damage. As oil entered the Gulf of Mexico and inland waters, officials closed fishing areas to protect public health. Health assessment methodology provides a framework for the systematic analysis of the routes by which populations may be exposed to contaminants and the characterization of public health implications. This assessment provides a basis for decision making to protect public health and inform the public of the risks associated with the event. The two major pathways for exposure are the inhalation of volatile compounds and the consumption of oil-contaminated seafood. From a human health perspective, seafood is a possible route of human exposure if the fish or shellfish take up and accumulates contaminants in oil. Crude oil is composed of thousands of hydrocarbons and the composition begins to change, or " weather " , as soon as it enters the environment. Contaminants of concern in crude oil are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), especially the aromatic hydrocarbons, BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene). Inhalation is the primary route of exposure for the VOCs. The other major compounds of concern are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which have the potential to be taken up by seafood that is consumed by people. PAHs are widespread in the environment and do not accumulate to any extent. Finfish and crustaceans metabolize PAHs and will breakdown and excrete any that are taken up; mollusks breakdown PAHs more slowly and can accumulate these compounds when the amount in the environment is high. Extensive testing must be conducted to reopen closed fishing areas. Federal and state agencies developed a seafood monitoring protocol for reopening of waters closed to fishing. The overall plan utilizes a three tiered screening approach: 1) No visible oil observed in the designated areas; 2) Organoleptic testing of the seafood; and 3) Chemical testing of the seafood. Sampling for organoleptic or chemical analysis occurs only in areas with no visible oil and under consideration for reopening. The seafood monitoring program is designed to test areas free of oil and under consideration for reopening. The tiered approach to sampling screens out areas with observable oil and uses the chemical analysis to confirm the seafood is free of contamination.},
