abstract: An improved understanding of heat vulnerable populations and locations is
  needed, especially in rural communities. The objective of this study was to identify
  area-level risk factors for heat-related illness (HRI) at the ZIP code level for
  urban and rural locations. We aggregated ZIP code-level emergency department visits
  into rural and urban locations based on population density. Area-level risk factors
  included previously established heat health risk factors (e.g. poverty, minority)
  and unexamined area-level risk factors common to rural locations (e.g. mobile homes,
  agriculture). Due to high spatial autocorrelation, a spatial error regression model
  was applied to identify risk factors with a significant relationship with HRI. Our
  results suggest that rural locations are also heat vulnerable, with greater rates
  of HRI compared to urban locations. Previously unexamined heat-health risk factors,
  including the number of mobile homes, non-citizens, and the labor-intensity of the
  agriculture, were all associated with increases of HRI in rural locations. In urban
  locations, previously established risk factors for heat-related mortality, such
  as decreased vegetation, living in poverty, and low education attainment were associated
  with increases in HRI.
