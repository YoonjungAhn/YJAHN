abstract: 'Background: A number of studies have shown associations between chronic
  exposure to particulate air pollution and increased mortality, particularly from
  cardiovascular disease, but fewer studies have examined the association between
  long-term exposure to the particulate air pollution and specific cardiovascular
  events, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). objective: We examined how long-term
  exposure to area particulate matter affects the onset of AMI, and we distinguished
  between area and local pollutants. Methods: Building on the Worcester Heart Attack
  Study, an ongoing community-wide investigation examining changes over time in myocardial
  infarction incidence in greater Worcester, Massachusetts, we conducted a case-control
  study of 4,467 confirmed cases of AMI diagnosed between 1995 and 2003 and 9,072
  matched controls selected from Massachusetts resident lists. We used a prediction
  model based on satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements to generate both
  exposure to particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) at the area level (10
  × 10 km) and the local level (100 m) based on local land use variables. We then
  examined the association between area and local particulate pollution and occurrence
  of AMI. results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in area PM2.5 (0.59 μg/m3)
  was associated with a 16% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 1.04, 1.29). An IQR
  increase in total PM2.5 (area + local, 1.05 μg/m3) was weakly associated with a
  4% increase in the odds of AMI (95% CI: 0.96, 1.11). Conclusions: Residential exposure
  to PM2.5 may best be represented by a combination of area and local PM2.5, and it
  is important to consider spatial gradients within a single metropolitan area when
  examining the relationship between particulate matter exposure and cardiovascular
  events.'
