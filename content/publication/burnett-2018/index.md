abstract: '<p> Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM <sub>2.5</sub> ) is
  a major global health concern. Quantitative estimates of attributable mortality
  are based on disease-specific hazard ratio models that incorporate risk information
  from multiple PM <sub>2.5</sub> sources (outdoor and indoor air pollution from use
  of solid fuels and secondhand and active smoking), requiring assumptions about equivalent
  exposure and toxicity. We relax these contentious assumptions by constructing a
  PM <sub>2.5</sub> -mortality hazard ratio function based only on cohort studies
  of outdoor air pollution that covers the global exposure range. We modeled the shape
  of the association between PM <sub>2.5</sub> and nonaccidental mortality using data
  from 41 cohorts from 16 countries—the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We
  then constructed GEMMs for five specific causes of death examined by the global
  burden of disease (GBD). The GEMM predicts 8.9 million [95% confidence interval
  (CI): 7.5–10.3] deaths in 2015, a figure 30% larger than that predicted by the sum
  of deaths among the five specific causes (6.9; 95% CI: 4.9–8.5) and 120% larger
  than the risk function used in the GBD (4.0; 95% CI: 3.3–4.8). Differences between
  the GEMM and GBD risk functions are larger for a 20% reduction in concentrations,
  with the GEMM predicting 220% higher excess deaths. These results suggest that PM
  <sub>2.5</sub> exposure may be related to additional causes of death than the five
  considered by the GBD and that incorporation of risk information from other, nonoutdoor,
  particle sources leads to underestimation of disease burden, especially at higher
  concentrations. </p>'
