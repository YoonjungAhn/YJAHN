abstract: At present, there is little guidance on how to communicate the dangers relating
  to hot weather events and on how to better prepare for them. Social responses to
  hot weather risks need to be a priority as populations around the world become more
  exposed to these under a changing climate. In this commentary, we argue that policy
  interventions focused on improving resilience to hot weather need to be more closely
  aligned with broader sustainability challenges and more effectively incorporate
  communication, behaviour, and social insights. With a particular focus on the UK,
  we highlight the risks of not taking these into account and outline ways in which
  policy-making on hot weather events could be improved, by drawing on international
  best practice and supporting decision-making within a range of relevant institutions
  across the health, transport and housing sectors.
