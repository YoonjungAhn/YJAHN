abstract: "About 2.8 billion people around the world still depend on biomass as their
  primary energy source. This traditional custom affects the environment and severely
  impacts the health and life quality of the rural residents, especially in the elderly
  group. Based on the published data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal
  Study (CHARLS) conducted in 2018, this paper carefully explores the impact of the
  energy consumption revolution on the health of rural elderly adults and its response
  mechanism. The results from the empirical analysis show that: (1) The positive response
  of rural families to the energy consumption revolution can significantly improve
  the elderly adults' health condition; (2) The energy consumption revolution can
  improve the rural elderly adults' health by enhancing the home environmental sanitation
  (home environmental effect) and life satisfaction (psychological effect); (3) In
  the process of energy consumption revolution affecting the rural elderly's health,
  the factor age plays a negative regulatory role, in other words, the older the elderly,
  the lower the marginal effect of energy consumption revolution on their health improvement.
  This paper uses the propensity score matching method to deal with the endogenous
  problem of the regression model, and uses a placebo test and the substitution estimation
  method to check the robustness of the empirical results. As well, this research
  puts forward some policy suggestions, such as increasing investment in energy infrastructure
  in rural areas, reducing the cost of using clean energy, combining environmental
  energy protection with increasing energy income, and improving medical security
  conditions in rural areas."
