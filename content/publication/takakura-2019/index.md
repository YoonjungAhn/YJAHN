abstract: Changes in the environmental heat stress need to be properly evaluated to
  manage the risk of heat-related illnesses, particularly in the context of climate
  change. The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is a useful index for evaluating heat
  stress and anticipating conditions related to heat-related illness in the present
  climate, but projecting the WBGT with a sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution
  remains challenging for future climate conditions. In this study, we developed a
  methodological framework for estimating the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT
  based on the output of general circulation models using only simple calculations.
  The method was applied to six sites in Japan and its performance was evaluated.
  The proposed method could reproduce the site-specific hourly resolution WBGT with
  a high accuracy. Based on the developed framework, we constructed future (2090s)
  projections under two different greenhouse gas emission pathways. These projections
  showed a consistent rise in the WBGT and thus the capacity to perform physically
  demanding activities is expected to decrease. To demonstrate the usefulness of the
  projected WBGT in planning adaptation measures, we identified the optimal working
  schedules which would minimize outdoor workers’ exposure to heat at a specific site.
  The results show that a substantial shift in the working time is required in the
  future if outdoor workers are to compensate the effect of increased heat exposure
  only by changing their working hours. This methodological framework and the projections
  will provide local practitioners with useful information to manage the increased
  risk of heat stress under climate change.
