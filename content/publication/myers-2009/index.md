abstract: 'Large-scale anthropogenic changes to the natural environment, including
  land-use change, climate change, and the deterioration of ecosystem services, are
  all accelerating. These changes are interacting to generate five major emerging
  public health threats that endanger the health and well-being of hundreds of millions
  of people. These threats include increasing exposure to infectious disease, water
  scarcity, food scarcity, natural disasters, and population displacement. Taken together,
  they may represent the greatest public health challenge humanity has faced. There
  is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the dynamics of each of these
  threats: the complex interplay of factors that generate them, the characteristics
  of populations that make them particularly vulnerable, and the identification of
  which populations are at greatest risk from each of these threats. Such improved
  understanding would be the basis for stepped-up efforts at modeling and mapping
  global vulnerability to each of these threats. It would also help natural resource
  managers and policy makers to estimate the health impacts associated with their
  decisions and would allow aid organizations to target their resources more effectively.
