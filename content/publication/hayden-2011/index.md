abstract: Climate change is projected to increase the number of days producing excessive
  heat across the southwestern United States, increasing population exposure to extreme
  heat events. Extreme heat is currently the main cause of weather-related mortality
  in the United States, where the negative health effects of extreme heat are disproportionately
  distributed among geographic regions and demographic groups. To more effectively
  identify vulnerability to extreme heat, complementary local-level studies of adaptive
  capacity within a population are needed to augment census-based demographic data
  and downscaled weather and climate models. This pilot study, conducted in August
  2009 in Phoenix, Arizona, reports responses from 359 households in three U.S. Census
  block groups identified as heat-vulnerable based on heat distress calls, decedent
  records, and demographic characteristics. This study sought to understand social
  vulnerability to extreme heat at the local level as a complex phenomenon with explicit
  characterization of coping and adaptive capacity among urban residents. Â© 2011 American
