abstract: This review discusses human thermoregulation during exercise and the measurement
  of body temperature in clinical and exercise settings. The thermoregulatory mechanisms
  play important roles in maintaining physiological homeostasis during rest and physical
  exercise. Physical exertion poses a challenge to thermoregulation by causing a substantial
  increase in metabolic heat production. However, within a non-thermolytic range,
  the thermoregulatory mechanisms are capable of adapting to sustain physiological
  functions under these conditions. The central nervous system may also rely on hyperthermia
  to protect the body from \"overheating.\" Hyperthermia may serve as a self-limiting
  signal that triggers central inhibition of exercise performance when a temperature
  threshold is achieved. Exposure to sub-lethal heat stress may also confer tolerance
  against higher doses of heat stress by inducing the production of heat shock proteins,
  which protect cells against the thermolytic effects of heat. Advances in body temperature
  measurement also contribute to research in thermoregulation. Current evidence supports
  the use of oral temperature measurement in the clinical setting, although it may
  not be as convenient as tympanic temperature measurement using the infrared temperature
  scanner. Rectal and oesophagus temperatures are widely accepted surrogate measurements
  of core temperature (Tc), but they cause discomfort and are less likely to be accepted
  by users. Gastrointestinal temperature measurement using the ingestible temperature
  sensor provides an acceptable level of accuracy as a surrogate measure of Tc without
  causing discomfort to the user. This form of Tc measurement also allows Tc to be
  measured continuously in the field and has gained wider acceptance in the last decade.
