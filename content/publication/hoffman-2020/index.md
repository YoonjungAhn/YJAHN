abstract: 'The increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of heat waves due to
  human-caused climate change puts historically underserved populations in a heightened
  state of precarity, as studies observe that vulnerable communities—especially those
  within urban areas in the United States—are disproportionately exposed to extreme
  heat. Lacking, however, are insights into fundamental questions about the role of
  historical housing policies in cauterizing current exposure to climate inequities
  like intra-urban heat. Here, we explore the relationship between “redlining”, or
  the historical practice of refusing home loans or insurance to whole neighborhoods
  based on a racially motivated perception of safety for investment, with present-day
  summertime intra-urban land surface temperature anomalies. Through a spatial analysis
  of 108 urban areas in the United States, we ask two questions: (1) how do historically
  redlined neighborhoods relate to current patterns of intra-urban heat? and (2) do
  these patterns vary by US Census Bureau region? Our results reveal that 94% of studied
  areas display consistent city-scale patterns of elevated land surface temperatures
  in formerly redlined areas relative to their non-redlined neighbors by as much as
  7 ◦C. Regionally, Southeast and Western cities display the greatest differences
  while Midwest cities display the least. Nationally, land surface temperatures in
  redlined areas are approximately 2.6 ◦C warmer than in non-redlined areas. While
  these trends are partly attributable to the relative preponderance of impervious
  land cover to tree canopy in these areas, which we also examine, other factors may
  also be driving these differences. This study reveals that historical housing policies
  may, in fact, be directly responsible for disproportionate exposure to current heat
  events.'
