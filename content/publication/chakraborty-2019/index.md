abstract: A growing literature documents the effects of heat stress on premature mortality
  and other adverse health outcomes. Urban heat islands (UHI) can exacerbate these
  adverse impacts in cities by amplifying heat exposure during the day and inhibiting
  the body's ability to recover at night. Since the UHI intensity varies not only
  across, but also within cities, intra-city variation may lead to differential impact
  of urban heat stress on different demographic groups. To examine these differential
  impacts, we combine satellite observations with census data to evaluate the relationship
  between distributions of both UHI and income at the neighborhood scale for 25 cities
  around the world. We find that in most (72%) cases, poorer neighborhoods experience
  elevated heat exposure, an incidental consequence of the intra-city distribution
  of income in cities. This finding suggests that policymakers should consider designing
  city-specific UHI reduction strategies to mitigate its impacts on the most socioeconomically
  vulnerable populations who may be less equipped to adapt to environmental stressors.
  Since the strongest contributor of intra-urban UHI variability among the physical
  characteristics considered in this study is a neighborhood's vegetation density,
  increasing green space in lower income neighborhoods is one strategy urban policymakers
  can adopt to ameliorate some of UHI's inequitable burden on economically disadvantaged
  residents.
