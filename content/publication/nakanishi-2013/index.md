abstract: Ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have started replacing UV lamps.
  The power per LED of high-power LED products has reached 12 W (14 A), which is 100
  times the values observed ten years ago. In addition, the cost of these high-power
  LEDs has been decreasing. In this study, we attempt to understand the technologies
  and potential of UV-LEDs.
