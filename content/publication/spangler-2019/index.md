abstract: Epidemiologic analyses of the health effects of meteorological exposures
  typically rely on observations from the nearest weather station to assess exposure
  for geographically diverse populations. Gridded climate datasets (GCD) provide spatially
  resolved weather data that may offer improved exposure estimates, but have not been
  systematically validated for use in epidemiologic evaluations. As a validation,
  we linearly regressed daily weather estimates from two GCDs, PRISM and Daymet, to
  observations from a sample of weather stations across the conterminous United States
  and compared spatially resolved, population-weighted county average temperatures
  and heat indices from PRISM to single-pixel PRISM values at the weather stations
  to identify differences. We found that both Daymet and PRISM accurately estimate
  ambient temperature and mean heat index at sampled weather stations, but PRISM outperforms
  Daymet for assessments of humidity and maximum daily heat index. Moreover, spatially-resolved
  exposure estimates differ from point-based assessments, but with substantial inter-county
  heterogeneity. We conclude that GCDs offer a potentially useful approach to exposure
  assessment of meteorological variables that may, in some locations, reduce exposure
  measurement error, as well as permit assessment of populations distributed far from
  weather stations.
