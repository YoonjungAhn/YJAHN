abstract: This paper explores different conceptual and policy spaces of wellbeing.
  The increasing use of wellbeing in contemporary health debates affords geographers
  of health new arena in which to explore the processes that promote, remedy or regenerate
  health and ill-health. The paper first critically reviews the theoretical approaches
  and challenges for operationalizing the concept of wellbeing in both research and
  policy. We then present a framework of the spaces of wellbeing to provoke discussion
  and research amongst geographers of health. The paper concludes with proposals for
  future research orientations. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © The New Zealand
