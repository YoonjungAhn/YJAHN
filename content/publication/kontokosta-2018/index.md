abstract: 'Resilience planning and emergency management require policymakers and agency
  leaders to make difficult decisions regarding which at-risk populations should be
  given priority in the allocation of limited resources. Our work focuses on benchmarking
  neighborhood resilience by developing a unified, multi-factor index of local and
  regional resilience capacity: the Resilience to Emergencies and Disasters Index
  (REDI). The strength of the REDI methodology is the integration of measures of physical,
  natural, and social systems – operationalized through the collection and analysis
  of large-scale, heterogeneous, and high resolution urban data – to classify and
  rank the relative resilience capacity embedded in localized urban systems. Feature
  selection methodologies are discussed to justify the selection of included indicator
  variables. Hurricane Sandy is used to validate the REDI scores by measuring the
  recovery periods for neighborhoods directly impacted by the storm. Using over 12,000,000
  records for New York City’s 311 service request system, we develop a proxy for neighborhood
  activity, both pre- and post-event. Hurricane Sandy had a significant and immediate
  impact on neighborhoods classified as least resilient based on the calculated REDI
  scores, while the most resilient neighborhoods were shown to better withstand disruption
  to normal activity patterns and more quickly recover to pre-event functional capacity.'
