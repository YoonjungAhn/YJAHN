abstract: 'The aim of the study was to identify the major heat waves (HW) that occurred
  in France from 1971 to 2003 and describe their impact on all-cause and cause-specific
  mortality. Heat waves were defined as periods of at least three consecutive days
  when the maximum and the minimum temperature, averaged over the whole France, were
  simultaneously greater than their respective 95th percentile. The underlying causes
  of death were regrouped into 18 categories. Heatstroke, hyperthermia and dehydration
  were assigned to the “heat-related causes” (HRC) category. The numbers of deaths
  observed (O) during the identified HW were compared to those expected (E) on the
  basis of the mortality rates reported for the three preceding years. Six HW were
  identified from the period 1971 to 2003. They were associated with great excess
  mortality (from 1,300 to 13,700 deaths). The observations are compatible with a
  moderate harvesting effect for four of the six HW. The mortality ratios increased
  with age for subjects aged over 55&nbsp;years and were higher for women than for
  men over 75&nbsp;years. For the six HW, the excess mortality was significant for
  almost all the causes of death: (1) the greatest excess mortality (O–E) were observed
  for cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, HRC, ill-defined
  conditions and injury and poisoning, and (2) the mortality ratios (O/E) were highest
  for HRC, respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, mental disorders, infectious
  diseases, and endocrine and nutritional diseases. Heat waves associated with excess
  mortality are not rare events in this temperate-climate country. The excess mortality
  is much greater than HRC mortality. Some populations are particularly vulnerable
  to HW: the elderly, women and people with some specific diseases. However, no segment
  of the population may be considered protected from the risks associated with HW.'
