abstract: Comparing demographic small area estimates across multiple time periods
  is hindered by boundary changes in census enumeration units. Areal interpolation
  can resolve temporal incompatibilities, but underlying assumptions of uniform population
  density within units is sometimes flawed and results in distorted estimates. Dasymetric
  modeling refines spatial precision by limiting areal interpolation to the most likely
  residential areas. Here, a systematic examination of the impacts of dasymetric refinement
  on temporal interpolation accuracy compares errors that emerge as a consequence
  of differing time spans. This paper compares the accuracy of three commonly utilized
  methods of areal interpolation for temporal analysis of population data over the
  1990-2010 decades. It examines whether multioral dasymetric refinement prior to
  areal interpolation improves the accuracy of small area estimates, comparing two
  different demographic contexts. Data sets include tract-level demography exhibiting
  dramatic growth (Las Vegas, Nevada), and relative stability (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania).
  Areal interpolation with and without the dasymetric refinement is validated using
  block level data. The dasymetrically refined target density weighting (TDW) provides
  the overall best performance for the 2000 source data and the expectation maximization
  (EM) method gives the overall best performance for the 1990 source data; effects
  of refinement are more prominent in areas of faster population change.
