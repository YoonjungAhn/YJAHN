abstract: The potential levels of exposure to indoor overheating in an urban environment
  are assessed for vulnerable social housing residents. Particular focus is given
  to the synergistic effects between summertime ventilation behaviour, indoor temperature
  and air pollutant concentration in relation to energy retrofit and climate change.
  Three different types of social housing are investigated (1900s' low-rise, 1950s'
  mid-rise and 1960s' high-rise). The case study dwellings are located in Central
  London and occupied by vulnerable individuals (elderly and/or people suffering from
  ill-health or mobility impairment). Indoor temperature monitoring suggests that
  occupants are already exposed to some degree of overheating; the highest levels
  of overheating occur in 1960s' high-rise tower blocks. The thermal and airflow performance
  simulation of a mid-floor flat in the 1960s' block under the current and projected
  future climate indicates that improved natural ventilation strategies may reduce
  overheating risk to a certain extent, with night cooling and shading being slightly
  more effective than all-day rapid ventilation. However, their potential may be limited
  in future due to high external temperatures and the undesired ingress of outdoor
  pollutants. This highlights the need for the development of combined strategies
  aiming to achieve both indoor thermal comfort and air quality.
