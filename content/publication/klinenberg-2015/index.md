abstract: "Second edition. Heat waves in the United States kill more people during
  a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could
  explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths
  resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists
  have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials
  have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg
  takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a \\\"social
  autopsy,\\\" examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city
  that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been. Prologue
  : the urban inferno -- Introduction : the city of extremes -- Dying alone : the
  social production of isolation -- Race, place, and vulnerability : urban neighborhoods
  and the ecology of support -- The state of disaster : city services in the empowerment
  era -- Governing by public relations -- The spectacular city : new organizations
  and the representation of catastrophe -- Conclusion : emerging dangers in the urban
  environment -- Epilogue : together in the end."
