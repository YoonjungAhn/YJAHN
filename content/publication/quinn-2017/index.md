abstract: During heat waves, fatal overexposure to heat most often occurs at home.
  It is not known how factors such as building size, floor level, and different types
  of air conditioning (AC) contribute to excess indoor heat. We monitored indoor temperature
  and humidity in 36 apartments in New York City during summers 2014 and 2015 and
  used these values to calculate the indoor heat index (HI). We investigated the role
  of AC type and building-level factors on indoor HI using multilevel regression models.
  Thirty-four of 36 homes had AC. Central and ductless AC types were associated with
  the coolest indoor conditions; homes with window and portable AC were significantly
  warmer. Apartments on the top floor of a building were significantly hotter during
  heat advisory periods than other apartments regardless of the presence of AC. High
  indoor HI levels persisted in some homes for approximately 1 day following the end
  of the two heat advisory periods. We provide concrete evidence of higher heat levels
  in top floor apartments and in homes with certain types of AC. High heat levels
  that persist indoors after outdoor heat has subsided may present an underappreciated
  public health risk.
