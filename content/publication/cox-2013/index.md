abstract: Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air (C) have been suspected
  of contributing causally to increased acute (e.g., same-day or next-day) human mortality
  rates (R). We tested this causal hypothesis in 100 United States cities using the
  publicly available NMMAPS database. Although a significant, approximately linear,
  statistical C-R association exists in simple statistical models, closer analysis
  suggests that it is not causal. Surprisingly, conditioning on other variables that
  have been extensively considered in previous analyses (usually using splines or
  other smoothers to approximate their effects), such as month of the year and mean
  daily temperature, suggests that they create strong, nonlinear confounding that
  explains the statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality rates in this data
  set. As this finding disagrees with conventional wisdom, we apply several different
  techniques to examine it. Conditional independence tests for potential causation,
  nonparametric classification tree analysis, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and
  Granger- Sims causality testing, show no evidence that PM2.5 concentrations have
  any causal impact on increasing mortality rates. This apparent absence of a causal
  C-R relation, despite their statistical association, has potentially important implications
  for managing and communicating the uncertain health risks associated with, but not
  necessarily caused by, PM2.5 exposures. Â© 2013 University of Massachusetts.
