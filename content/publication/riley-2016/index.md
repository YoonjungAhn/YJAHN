abstract: Introduction Live-in formal caregivers spend consecutive days in patients'
  homes, raising questions about their ability to secure adequate sleep while on duty.
  Few studies have examined sleeping conditions and outcomes for this growing workforce.
  Methods We collected weeklong sleep logs and interview data from 32 Filipino caregivers
  in Los Angeles who provide live-in services at least 3 consecutive days per week.
  Results Respondents recorded a total average of 6.4 sleep hours during workdays
  divided over 2.4 sleep periods. Caregivers rated sleep quality as lower while at
  work; over 40% indicated excessive daytime sleepiness. Female caregivers reported
  worse sleep outcomes than their male counterparts. Some variations in sleep outcomes
  were found by employment arrangements. Conclusion Live-in caregivers experience
  frequent sleep interruptions at all hours of the day and night to attend to patients'
  needs. The resulting impacts on sleep quality pose risks for both work-related injury
  and errors in patient care. Am.
