abstract: Mortality increases during periods of elevated heat. Identification of vulnerable
  subgroups by demographics, causes of death, and geographic regions, including deaths
  occurring at home, is needed to inform public health prevention efforts. We calculated
  mortality relative risks (RRs) and excess deaths associated with a large-scale California
  heat wave in 2006, comparing deaths during the heat wave with reference days. For
  total (all-place) and at-home mortality, we examined risks by demographic factors,
  internal and external causes of death, and building climate zones. During the heat
  wave, 582 excess deaths occurred, a 5% increase over expected (RR = 1.05, 95% confidence
  interval (CI) 1.03–1.08). Sixty-six percent of excess deaths were at home (RR =
  1.12, CI 1.07–1.16). Total mortality risk was higher among those aged 35–44 years
  than ≥65, and among Hispanics than whites. Deaths from external causes increased
  more sharply (RR = 1.18, CI 1.10–1.27) than from internal causes (RR = 1.04, CI
  1.02–1.07). Geographically, risk varied by building climate zone; the highest risks
  of at-home death occurred in the northernmost coastal zone (RR = 1.58, CI 1.01–2.48)
  and the southernmost zone of California’s Central Valley (RR = 1.43, CI 1.21–1.68).
  Heat wave mortality risk varied across subpopulations, and some patterns of vulnerability
  differed from those previously identified. Public health efforts should also address
  at-home mortality, non-elderly adults, external causes, and at-risk geographic regions.
