abstract: "Background: With a warming climate, it is important to identify sub-populations
  at risk of harm during extreme heat. Several international studies have reported
  that individuals from ethnic minorities are at increased risk of heat-related illness,
  for reasons that are not often discussed. Objective: The aim of this article is
  to investigate the underpinning reasons as to why ethnicity may be associated with
  susceptibility to extreme heat, and how this may be relevant to Australia's population.
  Design: Drawing upon literary sources, the authors provide commentary on this important,
  yet poorly understood area of heat research. Results: Social and economic disparities,
  living conditions, language barriers, and occupational exposure are among the many
  factors contributing to heat-susceptibility among minority ethnic groups in the
  United States. However, there is a knowledge gap about socio-cultural influences
  on vulnerability in other countries. Conclusion: More research needs to be undertaken
  to determine the effects of heat on tourists, migrants, and refugees who are confronted
  with a different climatic environment. Thorough epidemiological investigations of
  the association between ethnicity and heat-related health outcomes are required,
  and this could be assisted with better reporting of nationality data in health statistics.
  Climate change adaptation strategies in Australia and elsewhere need to be ethnically
  inclusive and cognisant of an upward trend in the proportion of the population who
  are migrants and refugees."
