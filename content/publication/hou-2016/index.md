abstract: Extreme air pollution meteorological events, such as heat waves, temperature
  inversions and atmospheric stagnation episodes, can significantly affect air quality.
  Based on observational data, we have analyzed the long-term evolution of extreme
  air pollution meteorology on the global scale and their potential impacts on air
  quality, especially the high pollution episodes. We have identified significant
  increasing trends for the occurrences of extreme air pollution meteorological events
  in the past six decades, especially over the continental regions. Statistical analysis
  combining air quality data and meteorological data further indicates strong sensitivities
  of air quality (including both average air pollutant concentrations and high pollution
  episodes) to extreme meteorological events. For example, we find that in the United
  States the probability of severe ozone pollution when there are heat waves could
  be up to seven times of the average probability during summertime, while temperature
  inversions in wintertime could enhance the probability of severe particulate matter
  pollution by more than a factor of two. We have also identified significant seasonal
  and spatial variations in the sensitivity of air quality to extreme air pollution
  meteorology.
