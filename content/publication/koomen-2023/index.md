abstract: High resolution models are essential to assess the localised impacts of
  global environmental change. To enable the estimation of the impacts of location-specific
  change, this paper presents a new modelling approach that disaggregates scenario-based
  national-level urban population estimates derived from the often-applied Shared
  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to high-resolution spatial grid (30 arc sec) representations
  of urban area and local population. By combining high-resolution spatial data, a
  sophisticated statistics-based calibration approach and a computationally efficient
  modelling framework, we can coherently describe local changes in urban area and
  population across the globe. Both developments are modelled simultaneously using
  the same scenario assumptions, but divergent patterns are shown to arise when, for
  example, population decline coincides with decreasing densities that yield an increase
  in urban area. The model can be applied in integrated global assessment studies
  focused on trends in local exposure to natural hazards or environmental impacts
  of urban change. The improved resolution of this new model is crucial to assess
  the impacts of future population growth in developing regions where most of the
  planet's biodiversity concentrates near large populations that live in clusters
  of smaller urban areas previously not captured by coarser resolution models.
