abstract: Health and environmental hazards related to high pollution concentrations
  have become a serious issue from public policy perspectives and human health. Using
  Machine Learning (ML) approach, this research aims to improve the estimation of
  grid-wise PM2.5, a criteria pollutant, by reducing systematic bias from speciation
  provided by MERRA-from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications
  version 2 (MERRA-2). The ML model was trained using various meteorological parameters
  and aerosol species simulated by MERRA-2 and ground measurements from Environmental
  Protection Agency (EPA) air quality system stations. The ML approach significantly
  improved performance and reduced mean bias in the 0–10 μg m−3 range. We also used
  the Random Forest ML model for each EPA region using 1 year of collocated data sets.
  The resulting ML models for each EPA region were validated, and the aggregate data
  set has a Spearman Rank correlation (SR) of 0.73 (RMSE = 4.8 μg m−3) and 0.69 (RMSE = 5.8 μg m−3)
  for training and testing, respectively. The SR (and RMSE in μg m−3) increased to
  0.81 (3.9), 0.89 (1.6), and 0.90 (1.1) for daily, monthly, and yearly averages,
  respectively. The results from the initial implementation of the ML model for the
  global region are encouraging. Still, they require more research and development
  to overcome challenges associated with data gaps in many parts of the world.
