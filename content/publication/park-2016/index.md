abstract: Pollutants, which are emitted from building materials during the 'use phase',
  may have significant adverse impacts on human health. This study proposes a methodology
  for assessing the impacts on human health due to pollutants emitted from building
  materials during the 'use phase'. The proposed methodology estimates the amounts
  of pollutants emitted from building materials by applying the emission factors measured
  by chamber tests to the emission models. Then, the human health impacts are derived
  by multiplying the intake fraction and human health effect factors by the amount
  of pollutants emitted from building materials. In case study, the human carcinogenic
  potential (HCP) (6.74E-05 casecan) calculated by the proposed methodology was almost
  identical to the HCP (6.80E-05 casecan) calculated by the health risk assessment.
  It turns out that the proposed methodology is capable of producing reasonable results.
  The proposed methodology can be expected to assess the human health impacts of buildings
  more accurately in LCA. In addition, the proposed methodology will be useful to
  improving the indoor environment of buildings because it can predict the impacts
  on human health during the building design phase.
