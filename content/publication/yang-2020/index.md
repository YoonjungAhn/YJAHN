abstract: Modern Evolutionary Economics Evolutionary economics sees the economy as
  always in motion with change being driven largely by continuing innovation. This
  approach to economics, heavily infl uenced by the work of Joseph Schumpeter, saw
  a revival as an alternative way of thinking about economic advancement as a result
  of Richard Nelson and Sidney Winterâ€™s seminal book, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic
  Change , fi rst published in 1982. In this long- awaited follow- up, Nelson is joined
  by leading fi gures in the fi eld of evolutionary economics, reviewing in detail
  how this perspective has been manifest in various areas of economic inquiry where
  evolutionary economists have been active. Providing the perfect overview for interested
  economists and social scientists, readers will learn how in each of the diverse
  fi elds featured, evolutionary economics has enabled an improved understanding of
  how and why economic progress occurs. Richard
