abstract: This article examines the relationship between spatial dependency and spatial
  heterogeneity, two properties unique to spatial data. The property of spatial dependence
  has led to a large body of research into spatial autocorrelation and also, largely
  independently, into geostatistics. The property of spatial heterogeneity has led
  to a growing awareness of the limitation of global statistics and the value of local
  statistics and local statistical models. The article concludes with a discussion
  of how the two properties can be accommodated within the same modelling framework.
