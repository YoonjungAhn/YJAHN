abstract: 'Background: There is a well-established relationship between high ambient
  temperature and risk of death. However, the number of deaths attributable to heat
  each year in the United States remains incompletely quantified. Methods: We replicated
  the approach from a large, international study to estimate temperature-mortality
  associations in 297 United States counties and additionally calculated the number
  of deaths attributable to heat, a quantity of likely interest to policymakers and
  the public. Results: Across 297 counties representing 61.9% of the United States
  population in 2000, we estimate that an average of 5,608 (95% empirical confidence
  interval = 4,748, 6,291) deaths were attributable to heat annually, 1997-2006. Conclusions:
  Our results suggest that the number of deaths related to heat in the United States
  is substantially larger than previously reported.'
