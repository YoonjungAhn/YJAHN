abstract: We present new global maps of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification at
  an unprecedented 1-km resolution for the present-day (1980–2016) and for projected
  future conditions (2071–2100) under climate change. The present-day map is derived
  from an ensemble of four high-resolution, topographically-corrected climatic maps.
  The future map is derived from an ensemble of 32 climate model projections (scenario
  RCP8.5), by superimposing the projected climate change anomaly on the baseline high-resolution
  climatic maps. For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble
  spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications.
  The new maps exhibit a higher classification accuracy and substantially more detail
  than previous maps, particularly in regions with sharp spatial or elevation gradients.
  We anticipate the new maps will be useful for numerous applications, including species
  and vegetation distribution modeling. The new maps including the associated confidence
  maps are freely available via www.gloh2o.org/koppen .
