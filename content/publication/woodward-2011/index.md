abstract: Adaptation is necessary because climate change has gained considerable momentum.
  Deep cuts in emissions must be made rapidly to avoid warming of 2° above preindustrial
  levels but this is most unlikely, given present trends. It is possible that warming
  may in fact reach 4°C or more by 2100. Risks to health result principally from the
  effects of climate change on local food production, severity and frequency of storms
  and floods, threats to water supplies, and the direct effects of heat. The health
  sector has an important role protecting health in times of climate change. However,
  other sectors must be involved as well-steps taken in agriculture, urban planning,
  water and civil defence, for instance, will have implications for prevention of
  illness and injury. We offer a framework for planning adaptation, taking into account
  present climate-sensitive health problems, control options, and constraints. © 2011
