abstract: Predicting PM2.5 concentrations at a fine spatial and temporal resolution
  (i.e., neighborhood, hourly) is challenging. Recent growth in low cost sensor networks
  is providing increased spatial coverage of air quality data that can be used to
  supplement data provided by monitors of regulatory agencies. We developed an hourly,
  500 × 500 m gridded PM2.5 model that integrates PurpleAir low-cost air sensor network
  data for Los Angeles County. We developed a quality control scheme for PurpleAir
  data. We included spatially and temporally varying predictors in a random forest
  model with random oversampling of high concentrations to predict PM2.5. The model
  achieved high prediction accuracy (10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 = 0.93, root
  mean squared error (RMSE) = 3.23 μg/m3; spatial CV R2 = 0.88, spatial RMSE = 4.33
  μg/m3; temporal CV R2 = 0.90, temporal RMSE = 3.85 μg/m3). Our model was able to
  predict spatial and diurnal patterns in PM2.5 on typical weekdays and weekends,
  as well as non-typical days, such as holidays and wildfire days. The model allows
  for far more precise estimates of PM2.5 than existing methods based on few sensors.
  Taking advantage of low-cost PM2.5 sensors, our hourly random forest model predictions
  can be combined with time-activity diaries in future studies, enabling geographically
  and temporally fine exposure estimation for specific population groups in studies
  of acute air pollution health effects and studies of environmental justice issues.
