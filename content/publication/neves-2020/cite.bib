 abstract = {This data captures climate information and HVAC energy use for a baseline prototype home and for a replacement alternative energy home. The baseline home is a traditional DX cooling/gas furnace system, and the alternate system is a geothermal heat pump. Cooling degree days (CDD), heating degree days (HDD) and relative humidity were gathered from historical weather data for 12 cities across the contiguous United States [1,2]. Geothermal heat pump coefficients were generated as inputs to EnergyPlus™ simulation software. These heat pump coefficients are generated by compiling heat pump performance data from 5 market leading, high efficiency residential geothermal heat pump manufacturers. These coefficients can be used to represent a general, market available heat pump in 2-ton, 3-ton, and 4-ton capacities. Baseline prototype home energy use by city was generated by EnergyPlus™ using the prototype home download file from www.energy.gov and the respective weather file for that city. This data can be interpreted as energy use per month by certain HVAC components. The ground source heat pump (GSHP) home energy use by city was generated from EnergyPlus™ and the respective city weather file. The GSHP model was created by the authors to model the alternate closed loop, GSHP system. Reuse potential for heat pump coefficients and home energy use analysis is strong.},
