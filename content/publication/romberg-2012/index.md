abstract: Heat sensitivity is a well-recognised feature in multiple sclerosis (MS).
  However, little is known about how heat affects physical performance in persons
  with MS. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of short-term heat
  stress on physical functioning in persons with MS. Twenty-three heat-sensitive MS
  subjects and 19 healthy controls participated. Moderate heat exposure took place
  in a dry Finnish sauna. Measures of upper and lower extremity function, static and
  dynamic balance, and walking capacity were applied. Core body temperature was measured
  by a telemetric physiological monitoring system. Assessments were conducted before,
  immediately, 1 hour, and 1 day after the heat exposure. Subjects with MS showed
  a significantly (P = 0.002) higher core body temperature than the controls following
  the heat stress. Performances in walking (P < 0.001), chair rise (P = 0.005) and
  functional reach (P = 0.04) were poorer in MS subjects than in controls immediately
  after the heat. No prolonged heat effects were observed. An increase in ambient
  temperature causes a higher core body temperature rise in MS subjects than in healthy
  controls. This rise in temperature is associated with acute, but not prolonged detrimental
  effects on physical functioning. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
