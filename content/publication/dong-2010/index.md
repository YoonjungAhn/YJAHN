abstract: This paper presents methods and results of small-area population estimation
  using a combined Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
  and parcel dataset for a study area in Denton, Texas, USA. A normalized digital
  surface model (nDSM) was created from a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital
  elevation model (DEM) built from LiDAR point data. Residential and commercial parcels
  were selected from parcel data and used as a mask to remove non-residential and
  non-commercial pixels from the nDSM. Classification results of residential areas
  from Landsat TM images acquired on two dates were used to further refine the nDSM.
  Using continuous and random census blocks as samples, building count, building area
  and building volume were calculated from the nDSM through mathematical morphological
  operations, zonal statistics, data conversion and spatial joining in a geographic
  information system (GIS). Combined with census 2000 data, a total of 10 ordinary
  least squares (OLS) regression models and geographically weighted regression (GWR)
  models were built and applied to the census blocks in the study area. Finally, accuracy
  assessments were carried out. The results show that the sign and magnitude of the
  relative estimation errors at the census-block level lead to underestimation of
  the total population in the study area. Possible reasons for the relatively low
  accuracies and problems for further investigation are also discussed. © 2010 Taylor
