abstract: 'This Synthesis Report is based on the reports of the three Working Groups
  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), including relevant Special
  Reports. It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the
  IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). This summary follows the structure of the
  longer report which addresses the following topics: Observed changes and their causes;
  Future climate change, risks and impacts; Future pathways for adaptation, mitigation
  and sustainable development; Adaptation and mitigation. In the Synthesis Report,
  the certainty in key assessment findings is communicated as in the Working Group
  Reports and Special Reports. It is based on the author teams’ evaluations of underlying
  scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from
  very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood
  (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain)1 . Where appropriate, findings
  are also formulated as statements of fact with- out using uncertainty qualifiers.
  This report includes information relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework
  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'
