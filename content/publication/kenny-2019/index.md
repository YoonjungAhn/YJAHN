abstract: Rising environmental temperatures represent a major threat to human health.
  The activation of heat advisories using evidence-based thresholds for high-risk
  outdoor ambient temperatures have been shown to be an effective strategy to save
  lives during hot weather. However, although the relationship between weather and
  human health has been widely defined by outdoor temperature, corresponding increases
  in indoor temperature during heat events can also be harmful to health especially
  in vulnerable populations. In this review, we discuss our current understanding
  of the relationship between outdoor temperature and human health and examine how
  human health can also be adversely influenced by high indoor temperatures during
  heat events. Our assessment of the existing literature revealed a high degree of
  variability in what can be considered an acceptable indoor temperature because there
  are differences in how different groups of people may respond physiologically and
  behaviorally to the same living environment. Finally, we demonstrate that both non-physiological
  (e.g., geographical location, urban density, building design) and physiological
  (e.g., sex, age, fitness, state of health) factors must be considered when defining
  an indoor temperature threshold for preserving human health in a warming global
  climate.
