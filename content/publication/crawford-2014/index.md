abstract: The rise of \" Big Data \" analytics in the private sector poses new challenges
  for privacy advocates. Through its reliance on existing data and predictive analysis
  to create detailed individual profiles, Big Data has explod-ed the scope of personally
  identifiable information (\" PII \"). It has also effec-tively marginalized regulatory
  schema by evading current privacy protections with its novel methodology. Furthermore,
  poor execution of Big Data meth-odology may create additional harms by rendering
  inaccurate profiles that nonetheless impact an individual's life and livelihood.
  To respond to Big Da-ta's evolving practices, this Article examines several existing
  privacy regimes and explains why these approaches inadequately address current Big
  Data challenges. This Article then proposes a new approach to mitigating predictive
  privacy harmsâ€”that of a right to procedural data due process. Although cur-rent
  privacy regimes offer limited nominal due process-like mechanisms, a more rigorous
  framework is needed to address their shortcomings. By examin-ing due process's role
  in the Anglo-American legal system and building on previous scholarship about due
  process for public administrative computer systems, this Article argues that individuals
  affected by Big Data should have similar rights to those in the legal system with
  respect to how their personal data is used in such adjudications. Using these principles,
  this Article analo-gizes a system of regulation that would provide such rights against
  private Big Data actors.
