abstract: We present the findings of a new time-series model that estimates short-term
  health effects of particulate matter and ozone, as applied to three U.S. cities.
  The model is based on observed fluctuations of daily death counts and estimates
  the corresponding daily subpopulations at-risk of imminent death; it also shows
  that virtually all elderly deaths are preceded by a brief period of extreme frailty.
  We augment previous research by allowing new entrants to this at-risk population
  to be influenced by the environment, rather than be random. The mean frail subpopulations
  in the three cities, each containing between 3000 and 5000 daily observations on
  mortality, pollution, and temperature, are estimated to be about 0.1% of those aged
  65 or more, and their life expectancies in this frail status are about one week.
  We find losses in life expectancy due to air pollution and temperature to be at
  most one day. Air pollution effects on new entrants into the frail population tend
  to exceed those on mortality. Our results provide context to the many time-series
  studies that have found significant short-term relationships between air quality
  and survival, and they suggest that benefits of air quality improvement should be
  based on increased life expectancy rather than estimated numbers of excess deaths.
