abstract: BACKGROUND Due to climate change, the frequency, intensity and severity
  of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold waves, storms, heavy precipitation
  causing wildfires, floods, and droughts are increasing, which could adversely affect
  human health. The purpose of this systematic review is therefore to assess the current
  literature about the association between these extreme weather events and their
  impact on the health of the European population.   METHODS Observational studies
  published from January 1, 2007 to May 17, 2020 on health effects of extreme weather
  events in Europe were searched systematically in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central
  Register of Controlled Trials. The exposures of interest included extreme temperature,
  heat waves, cold waves, droughts, floods, storms and wildfires. The health impacts
  included total mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, respiratory mortality
  and morbidity, and mental health. We conducted the systematic review following PRISMA
  (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis). The quality
  of the included studies was assessed using the NICE quality appraisal checklist
  (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).   RESULTS The search yielded
  1472 articles, of which 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in our review.
  Studies regarding five extreme weather events (extreme heat events, extreme cold
  events, wildfires, floods, droughts) were found. A positive association between
  extreme heat/cold events and overall, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality was
  reported from most studies. Wildfires are likely to increase the overall and cardiovascular
  mortality. Floods might be associated with the deterioration of mental health instead
  of mortality. Depending on their length, droughts could have an influence on both
  respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Contradictory evidence was found in heat-associated
  morbidity and wildfire-associated respiratory mortality. The associations are inconclusive
  due to the heterogeneous study designs, study quality, exposure and outcome assessment.   CONCLUSIONS
  Evidence from most of the included studies showed that extreme heat and cold events,
  droughts, wildfires and floods in Europe have negative impacts on human health including
  mental health, although some of the associations are not conclusive. Additional
  high-quality studies are needed to confirm our results and further studies regarding
  the effects of other extreme weather events in Europe are to be expected.
