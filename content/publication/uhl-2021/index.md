abstract: Most cities in the United States of America are thought to have followed
  similar development trajectories to evolve into their present form. However, data
  on spatial development of cities are limited prior to 1970. Here we leverage a compilation
  of high-resolution spatial land use and building data to examine the evolving size
  and form (shape and structure) of US metropolitan areas since the early twentieth
  century. Our analysis of building patterns over 100 years reveals strong regularities
  in the development of the size and density of cities and their surroundings, regardless
  of timing or location of development. At the same time, we find that trajectories
  regarding shape and structure are harder to codify and more complex. We conclude
  that these discrepant developments of urban size- and form-related characteristics
  are driven, in part, by the long-term decoupling of these two sets of attributes
  over time.
