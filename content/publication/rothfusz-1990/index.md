abstract: "Now that summer has spread its oppressive ridge over most of the Southern
  Region, NWS phones are ringing off their hooks with questions about the Heat Index.
  Many questions regard the actual equation used in calculating the Heat Index. Some
  callers are satisfied with the response that it is extremely complicated. Some are
  satisfied with the nomogram (see Attachment 1). But there are a few who will settle
  for nothing less than the equation itself. No true equation for the Heat Index exists.
  Heat Index values are derived from a collection of equations that comprise a model.
  This Technical Attachment presents an equation that approximates the Heat Index
  and, thus, should satisfy the latter group of callers. The Heat Index (or apparent
  temperature) is the result of extensive biometeorological studies. The parameters
  involved in its calculation are shown below (from Steadman, 1979). Each of these
  parameters can be described by an equation but they are given assumed magnitudes
  (in parentheses) in order to simplify the model. # Vapor pressure. Ambient vapor
  pressure of the atmosphere. (1.6 kPa) # Dimensions of a human. Determines the skin's
  surface area. (5' 7\\\" tall, 147 pounds) # Effective radiation area of skin. A
  ratio that depends upon skin surface area. (0.80) # Significant diameter of a human.
  Based on the body's volume and density. (15.3 cm) # Clothing cover. Long trousers
  and short-sleeved shirt is assumed. (84% coverage) # Core temperature. Internal
  body temperature. (98.6Â°F) # Core vapor pressure. Depends upon body's core temperature
  and salinity. (5.65 kPa) # Surface temperatures and vapor pressures of skin and
  clothing. Affects heat transfer from the skin's surface either by radiation or convection.
  These values are determined by an iterative process. # Activity. Determines metabolic
  output. (180 W m-2 of skin area for the model person walking outdoors at a speed
  of 3.1 mph) # Effective wind speed. Vector sum of the body's movement and an average
  wind speed. Angle between vectors influences convection from skin surface (below).
  (5 kts) # Clothing resistance to heat transfer. The magnitude of this value is based
  on the assumption that the clothing is 20% fiber and 80% air. # Clothing resistance
  to moisture transfer. Since clothing is mostly air, pure vapor diffusion is used
  here. # Radiation from the surface of the skin. Actually, a radiative heat-transfer
  coefficient determined from previous studies. # Convection from the surface of the
  skin. A convection coefficient also determined from previous studies. Influenced
  by kinematic viscosity of air and angle of wind. # Sweating rate. Assumes that sweat
  is uniform and not dripping from the body."
