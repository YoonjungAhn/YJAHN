abstract: 'This paper presents the top 10 data mining algorithms identified by the
  IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in December 2006: C4.5, k-Means,
  SVM, Apriori, EM, PageRank, AdaBoost, k NN, Naive Bayes, and CART. These top 10
  algorithms are among the most influential data mining algorithms in the research
  community. With each algorithm, we provide a description of the algorithm, discuss
  the impact of the algorithm, and review current and further research on the algorithm.
  These 10 algorithms cover classification, clustering, statistical learning, association
  analysis, and link mining, which are all among the most important topics in data
  mining research and development. Â© Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.'
