abstract: Epidemiologic research on extreme heat consistently finds significant impacts
  on human morbidity and mortality. However, most of these analyses do not use spatially
  explicit measures of heat (typically assessing exposures at major cities using the
  nearest weather station), and they frequently consider only ambient temperature
  or heat index. The field is moving toward more expansive analyses that use spatially
  resolved gridded meteorological datasets and alternative assessments of heat, such
  as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI),
  both of which require technical geoscientific skills that may be inaccessible to
  many public health researchers. To facilitate research in this domain, we created
  a database of population-weighted, spatially explicit daily heat metrics – including
  WBGT, UTCI, heat index, dewpoint temperature, net effective temperature, and humidex
  – for counties in the conterminous United States derived from the ERA5-Land gridded
  data set and using previously validated equations and algorithms. We also provide
  an R package to calculate these metrics, including gold-standard algorithms for
  estimating WBGT and UTCI, to facilitate replication.
