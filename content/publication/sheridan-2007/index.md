abstract: To examine the efficacy of municipal heat watch warning systems, a thorough
  evaluation of the heat mitigation plans of four North American cities - Dayton (Ohio,
  USA), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania, USA), Phoenix (Arizona, USA), and Toronto (Ontario,
  Canada) - was undertaken. In concert with this evaluation was a survey of residents
  in the metropolitan areas of these cities that gauged their perception of their
  own vulnerability to the heat, as well as their knowledge of heat warnings and the
  activities recommended to be undertaken to help mitigate the effects of the heat.
  In total, 908 respondents participated in the telephone survey. Some of the key
  results indicate that knowledge of the heat warning was nearly universal (90%),
  and likely due to pervasive media coverage more than any other means. Though knowledge
  of the event was widespread, knowledge of what to do was less common. Only around
  half of all respondents mentioned that they changed their behavior, and despite
  the diversity of information available on mitigating heat vulnerability, most respondents
  stated that they merely \"avoided the outdoors\" at all costs. Though air conditioning
  was nearly ubiquitous among respondents, over a third mentioned that economic factors
  of energy costs were considered in terms of how long or whether the air conditioner
  was turned on. Â© 2006 ISB.
