abstract: Spatial analyses of disease patterns have been used by investigators as
  one tool with which to address problems of disease causation. However, while the
  results of spatial studies may be suggestive, they have been definitive only rarely.
  This is because there are numerous epistemological, logical and methodological problems
  which are encountered in spatial analysis. It is important to address these problems
  as one step in answering the basic issues concerning the role of spatial analysis
  in the detection of disease causation. Â© 1983.
