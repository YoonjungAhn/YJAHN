abstract: Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network
  function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of
  neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing
  conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation,
  mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous
  system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin
  thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function
  in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and
  propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change
  interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency
  range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than
  1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin
  plasticity, as another form of activity- dependent plasticity, is relevant not only
  to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that
  involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator
  models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive
  synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss
  of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony
  of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy)
