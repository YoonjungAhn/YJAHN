abstract: 'Background: To assess the public health risk of heat waves and to set criteria
  for alerts for excessive heat, various meteorologic metrics and models are used
  in different jurisdictions, generally without systematic comparisons of alternatives.
  We report such an analysis for New York City that compared maximum heat index with
  alternative metrics in models to predict daily variation in warm-season natural-cause
  mortality from 1997 through 2006. Materials and methods: We used Poisson time-series
  generalized linear models and generalized additive models to estimate weather-mortality
  relationships using various metrics, lag and averaging times, and functional forms
  and compared model fit. Results: A model that included cubic functions of maximum
  heat index on the same and each of the previous 3 days provided the best fit, better
  than models using maximum, minimum, or average temperature, or spatial synoptic
  classification (SSC) of weather type. We found that goodness of fit and maximum
  heat index-mortality functions were similar using parametric and nonparametric models.
  Same-day maximum heat index was linearly related to mortality risk across its range.
  The slopes at lags of 1, 2, and 3 days were flat across moderate values but increased
  sharply between maximum heat index of 95째F and 100째F (35-38째C). SSC or other meteorologic
  variables added to the maximum heat index model moderately improved goodness of
  fit, with slightly attenuated maximum heat index-mortality functions. Conclusions:
  In New York City, maximum heat index performed similarly to alternative and more
  complex metrics in estimating mortality risk during hot weather. The linear relationship
  supports issuing heat alerts in New York City when the heat index is forecast to
  exceed approximately 95-100째F. Periodic city-specific analyses using recent data
  are recommended to evaluate public health risks from extreme heat.'
