abstract: There is a scientific consensus on the need for spatially detailed information
  on urban landscapes at a global scale. These data can support a range of environmental
  services, since cities are places of intense resource consumption and waste generation
  and of concentrated infrastructure and human settlement exposed to multiple hazards
  of natural and anthropogenic origin. In the face of climate change, urban data are
  also required to explore future urbanization pathways and urban design strategies
  in order to lock in long-term resilience and sustainability, protecting cities from
  future decisions that could undermine their adaptability and mitigation role. To
  serve this purpose, we present a 100ĝ€¯m-resolution global map of local climate
  zones (LCZs), a universal urban typology that can distinguish urban areas on a holistic
  basis, accounting for the typical combination of micro-scale land covers and associated
  physical properties. The global LCZ map, composed of 10 built and 7 natural land
  cover types, is generated by feeding an unprecedented number of labelled training
  areas and earth observation images into lightweight random forest models. Its quality
  is assessed using a bootstrap cross-validation alongside a thematic benchmark for
  150 selected functional urban areas using independent global and open-source data
  on surface cover, surface imperviousness, building height, and anthropogenic heat.
  As each LCZ type is associated with generic numerical descriptions of key urban
  canopy parameters that regulate atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability
  of this globally consistent and climate-relevant urban description is an important
  prerequisite for supporting model development and creating evidence-based climate-sensitive
  urban planning policies. This dataset can be downloaded from 10.5281/zenodo.6364594
