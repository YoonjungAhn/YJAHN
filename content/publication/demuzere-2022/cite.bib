 abstract = {There is a scientific consensus on the need for spatially detailed information on urban landscapes at a global scale. These data can support a range of environmental services, since cities are places of intense resource consumption and waste generation and of concentrated infrastructure and human settlement exposed to multiple hazards of natural and anthropogenic origin. In the face of climate change, urban data are also required to explore future urbanization pathways and urban design strategies in order to lock in long-term resilience and sustainability, protecting cities from future decisions that could undermine their adaptability and mitigation role. To serve this purpose, we present a 100ĝ€¯m-resolution global map of local climate zones (LCZs), a universal urban typology that can distinguish urban areas on a holistic basis, accounting for the typical combination of micro-scale land covers and associated physical properties. The global LCZ map, composed of 10 built and 7 natural land cover types, is generated by feeding an unprecedented number of labelled training areas and earth observation images into lightweight random forest models. Its quality is assessed using a bootstrap cross-validation alongside a thematic benchmark for 150 selected functional urban areas using independent global and open-source data on surface cover, surface imperviousness, building height, and anthropogenic heat. As each LCZ type is associated with generic numerical descriptions of key urban canopy parameters that regulate atmospheric responses to urbanization, the availability of this globally consistent and climate-relevant urban description is an important prerequisite for supporting model development and creating evidence-based climate-sensitive urban planning policies.
