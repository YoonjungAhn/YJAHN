abstract: The new national ambient air quality standard for particulate matter is
  summarized, with emphasis on fine particles, or particulate matter with aerodynamic
  diameter less than 2.5 Î¼m (PM2.5). Sources of ambient and indoor PM2.5 are summarized,
  followed by an overview of control strategies for both primary (directly emitted)
  particles and gaseous precursors of ambient particles. The role of future findings
  on the health effects of particles of different sizes or compositions is noted,
  as is the potential importance of controlling indoor exposures for susceptible people.
  EPA risk management research on sources and control options is summarized. The cost-effectiveness
  of prevention and control technologies for PM2.5 has not been well researched and
  documented. Optimum control strategies will likely include a variety of control
  options.
