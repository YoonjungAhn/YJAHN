abstract: 'Little is known about place attachment affecting natural environmental
  risk perception and coping. A systematic search of social science databases revealed
  31 works (1996â€“2016) directly addressing place attachment in relation to different
  types of natural hazard risks (e.g., seismic, volcanic, etc.). Across different
  contexts, the research shows: (a) positive and/or negative relationships between
  place attachment and natural environmental risk perception; (b) positive and/or
  negative relationships between place attachment and risk coping; and (c) mediating
  and moderating relationships. In particular, results show that: (a) highly attached
  individuals perceive natural environmental risks but underestimate their potential
  effects; (b) highly attached individuals are unwilling to relocate when facing natural
  environmental risks and more likely to return to risky areas after a natural environmental
  disaster; (c) place attachment acts both as a mediating and moderating variable
  between risk perception and coping. Place attachment should play a more significant
  role in natural environmental risk management.'
