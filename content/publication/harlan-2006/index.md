abstract: Human exposure to excessively warm weather, especially in cities, is an
  increasingly important public health problem. This study examined heat-related health
  inequalities within one city in order to understand the relationships between the
  microclimates of urban neighborhoods, population characteristics, thermal environments
  that regulate microclimates, and the resources people possess to cope with climatic
  conditions. A simulation model was used to estimate an outdoor human thermal comfort
  index (HTCI) as a function of local climate variables collected in 8 diverse city
  neighborhoods during the summer of 2003 in Phoenix, USA. HTCI is an indicator of
  heat stress, a condition that can cause illness and death. There were statistically
  significant differences in temperatures and HTCI between the neighborhoods during
  the entire summer, which increased during a heat wave period. Lower socioeconomic
  and ethnic minority groups were more likely to live in warmer neighborhoods with
  greater exposure to heat stress. High settlement density, sparse vegetation, and
  having no open space in the neighborhood were significantly correlated with higher
  temperatures and HTCI. People in warmer neighborhoods were more vulnerable to heat
  exposure because they had fewer social and material resources to cope with extreme
  heat. Urban heat island reduction policies should specifically target vulnerable
  residential areas and take into account equitable distribution and preservation
  of environmental resources. Â© 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
