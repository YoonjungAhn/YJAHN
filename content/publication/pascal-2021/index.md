abstract: Recent evidence suggests a synergistic acute effect between temperature,
  ozone and particulate matter (PM) on premature mortality. Several studies reported
  higher air pollution-related mortality risks during warm days, and higher heat-related
  mortality risk during polluted days. We investigated if interactions between temperature
  and air pollution modified the mortality response to an extent that would support
  the need for joint heat and air pollution warning systems. We developed a multicentre
  time-series design for 17 French cities for the period 2000–2015, investigating
  the influence of season and temperature on the air pollution (PM10 and ozone)-mortality
  relationship, and the influence of air pollution on the temperature-mortality relationship.
  Ozone and PM10 mortality risks exhibit an increasing gradient between spring, summer
  and heat waves. For instance, a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a
  3% [Confidence interval (CI) 95% 2.1:3.9] increase in mortality during summer, and
  with a 14.2% [CI 95% 5.6:23.4] increase in mortality during heat waves. The heat-mortality
  response was slightly influenced by air pollution, especially during the most extreme
  heat waves. Our results suggest that air pollution warnings should take season into
  account, using lower thresholds during summer and heat waves. Heat warning systems
  may not be improved by air pollution data, as its added value would be limited,
  compared to the complexity it would add to the warning systems. Efforts should be
  made to reduce ozone and PM10 concentrations during heat waves, even when they are
  already below regulatory thresholds.
