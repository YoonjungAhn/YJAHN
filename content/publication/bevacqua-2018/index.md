abstract: Coastal vulnerability is a spatial concept that identifies people and places
  that are susceptible to disturbances resulting from coastal hazards. Hazards in
  the coastal environment, such as coastal storms and erosion, pose significant threats
  to coastal physical, economic, and social systems. The theory of vulnerability has
  been an evolving idea over the past hundred years. In recent decades, improved technology
  and high-profile disaster events, has caused an increase in publications in the
  coastal hazards field. Modern approaches to understanding coastal vulnerability
  examine the complex systems that determine the spatial distribution of hazards,
  risks, and exposure. Consensus among today's researchers shows that coastal vulnerability
  is geographically dependent and requires place based investigations. This review
  examines over 200 coastal vulnerability related works. Through this extensive literature
  review, this research describes the evolution of vulnerability concepts, and the
  modern definition of vulnerability with the goal of providing a well-informed body
  of knowledge to be used in the advancement of resilience and increased sustainability
  in coastal areas.
