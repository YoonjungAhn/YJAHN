abstract: National census data represent the \"gold standard\" for authoritatively
  portraying a country's residential population distribution, but their aggregated
  counts for fixed administrative areas present problems for many geographic information
  system (GIS) analyses. Intelligent areal interpolation algorithms assist by transferring
  data from one zonal system to another using ancillary data to improve accuracy.
  All areal interpolation methods make assumptions and generate errors, and performance
  varies with both specific location and the data inputs used. This study adds to
  our understanding of the relative merits of alternative methods by comparing dasymetric,
  street network, and surface-based models interpolating across two spatial resolutions.
  It examines the importance of the ancillary data source used to drive the process,
  particularly the efficacy of open access products. Results from an empirical study
  show that interpolation accuracy is influenced by the choice of ancillary data input
  as well as the methodological approach adopted. The strongest overall performance
  is delivered by dasymetric mapping combined with open access data identifying the
  locations of buildings. Open access data sets offer considerable potential for widening
  the use of intelligent population interpolation tools, especially if plug-in tools
  to execute these algorithms can be made available for commonly used GIS software
  packages. Â© 2013 The Ohio State University.
