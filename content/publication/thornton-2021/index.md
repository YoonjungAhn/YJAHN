abstract: 'Access to daily high-resolution gridded surface weather data based on direct
  observations and over long time periods is essential for many studies and applications
  including vegetation, wildlife, soil health, hydrological modelling, and as driver
  data in Earth system models. We present Daymet V4, a 40-year daily meteorological
  dataset on a 1 km grid for North America, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, providing temperature,
  precipitation, shortwave radiation, vapor pressure, snow water equivalent, and day
  length. The dataset includes an objective quantification of uncertainty based on
  strict cross-validation analysis for temperature and precipitation results. The
  dataset represents several improvements from a previous version, and this data descriptor
  provides complete documentation for updated methods. Improvements include: reductions
  in the timing bias of input reporting weather station measurements; improvement
  to the three-dimensional regression model techniques in the core algorithm; and
  a novel approach to handling high elevation temperature measurement biases. We show
  cross-validation analyses with the underlying weather station data to demonstrate
  the technical validity of new dataset generation methods, and to quantify improved
  accuracy.'
