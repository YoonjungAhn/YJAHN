abstract: 'Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation
  and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining
  this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and
  Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation,
  equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major
  social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying
  social advantage/disadvantage-that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in
  health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged
  (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised
  racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their
  health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social
  disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely
  related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationali-sation
  of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health
  status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing
  health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups.
  These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies
  are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.'
