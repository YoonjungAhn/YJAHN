abstract: The lending record of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) has received
  little attention compared with HOLC's residential security maps. Specifically, the
  extent to which HOLC practiced racial and ethnic discrimination in the process of
  making and servicing more than a million loans to homeowners during the Depression
  has not been carefully examined. Using primary sources including HOLC publications,
  newspaper articles, 1930 census data, and mortgage records from Philadelphia, this
  research shows that HOLC did make loans to African Americans, Jews, and immigrants.
  Evidence suggests, however, that HOLC supported racial segregation in the process
  of reselling properties acquired through foreclosure. Â© 2003, Sage Publications.
