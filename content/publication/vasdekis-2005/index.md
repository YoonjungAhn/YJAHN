abstract: A random effects model is examined in the multivariate setting where more
  than one characteristics are measured at each time point. ML and REML estimators
  are obtained under the restriction that estimates of variance matrices being at
  least p.s.d. It is shown that REML has greater probability of giving full rank estimates
  of variance components matrices but as regards the efficiency in the estimation
  of the location parameter, correct specification of the number of random effects
  is needed. In general, REML provides larger estimates of variance of model parameters
  than ML.
