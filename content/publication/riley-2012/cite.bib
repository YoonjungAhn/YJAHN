 abstract = {This article describes an innovative approach to reach and educate workers and worker advocates about California’s outdoor heat illness prevention standard. In 2010, Cal/OSHA initiated a statewide education campaign to reduce heat-related illnesses and fatalities and increase awareness of the standard’s requirements. In Southern California, the UCLA Labor Occu- pational Safety and Health Program (LOSH) focused on three principal strategies of community-based outreach, popular education, and organiza- tional capacity building. Central to the LOSH approach was the integration of health promotores into core program planning and training activities and the expansion of campaign activities to a wide variety of rural and urban workers.Wedescribe each of these strategies and analyze the possibilities and constraints of worker education to support implementation of this standard, particularly given the vulnerabilities of the impacted workforce, the often precarious nature of employment arrangements for these workers, and the resource limitations of Cal/OSHA.},
