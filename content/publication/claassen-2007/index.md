abstract: fact that the WBGT index values need to be increased in tropical environments
  due to the underestimation of sweat rate and rate of evaporation. Acclimatisation
  does however reduce the differences in physiological strain experienced at equivalent
  WBGT heat stress index levels with different humidity levels. 7 Increased thermal
  load that is placed on employees may increase the risk for heat related illnesses.
  Performance of employees can also be affected due to the relationship that exists
  between percentage dehydration and performance. 8 It is therefore important that
  proper guidelines be drafted to allow accurate implementation of the WBGT heat stress
  index in hot wet conditions to protect the workforce and employers. The guidelines
  should provide correction factors and threshold temperatures to protect the health
  of the employees. Other protective approaches that are used are to screen employees
  for heat intolerance or to implement practices to ensure that employees at risk
  to develop heat related illnesses, are not allowed in the workplace. Educating the
  workforce concerning the dangers of heat illnesses, the importance of maintaining
  optimal hydration status during work and self pacing is still the most effective
  way to prevent heat illnesses. 9 This study was therefore conducted to determine
  the influence of two relative humidity levels on a range of equivalent WBGT heat
  stress index values on physiological responses known to be good indicators of thermal
  heat strain. METHODS Healthy un-acclimatised young men (N=16) were used. They underwent
  a medical screening that included a cardiovascular examination, and were declared
  fit to take part in the study. Informed consent was obtained from each subject and
  they were aware that they could withdraw from the experiment without any penalty.
  The physical characteristics of the test subjects are depicted in Table 1. Test
  subjects were individually calibrated using open circuit spirometry to complete
  work at an oxygen consumption of 1.34 L.min-1 with the application of a standardised
  step test protocol. This protocol required subjects to step at a rate of 18 steps.min-1
  for 9 minutes onto stepping heights of 20, 25, 30 and 35 cm respectively. A linear
  regression was calculated between oxygen consumption and stepping height to determine
  required stepping height for each subject that would yield an oxygen consumption
  of 1.34 L.min-1. The metabolic rate of the subjects was 450 watts, which is representative
  of activities such as loading a wheelbarrow with stones and mortar, hand moulding
  medium sized pieces, sawing (40 double pulls.min-1) and stripping of bark. 10
