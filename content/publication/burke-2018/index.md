abstract: Linkages between climate and mental health are often theorized but remain
  poorly quantified. In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading
  cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using
  comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico,
  we find that suicide rates rise 0.7% in US counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities
  for a 1 °C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter
  versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical
  adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in >600 million social media updates
  further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project
  that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9–40 thousand
  additional suicides (95% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico
  by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact
  of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.
