abstract: This paper examines the temperature-mortality relationship over the course
  of the twentieth-century United States both for its own interest and to identify
  potentially useful adaptations for coming decades. There are three primary findings.
  First, the mortality impact of days with mean temperature exceeding 807F declined
  by 75 percent. Almost the entire decline occurred after 1960. Second, the diffusion
  of residential air conditioning explains essentially the entire decline in hot day–related
  fatalities. Third, using Dubin and McFadden’s discrete continuous model, the present
  value of US consumer surplus from the introduction of residential air conditioning
  is estimated to be $85– $185 billion (2012 dollars).
