abstract: 'Climate change and land use change are increasing average and extreme temperatures.
  Hotter temperatures can detrimentally affect workers’ health and their economic
  productivity and livelihoods, especially in rural areas in industrializing countries
  that may be more vulnerable and less resilient. A growing literature has examined
  these factors at large spatial scales, yet few studies have done so at finer scales.
  Micro-level data from developing regions is needed to understand the extent of heat
  exposure, as well as current and future adaptation strategies of working, healthy,
  and rural populations. We fill this gap using objective environmental measurements
  from 3MTM QuestempTM 46 Heat Stress Monitors, as well as survey data from working,
  healthy, and rural communities in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our data contain two
  groups: those who work in only open areas, and those who work in both forests and
  open areas. We document workers’ livelihood strategies, work schedules, perceptions
  of how temperatures impact their work, and future adaptation strategies for even
  hotter days. Ambient temperatures are 2.6–8.3 °C cooler in forests compared to open
  areas, indicating the temperature effects of deforestation can be immediate and
  significant. Those working only in open areas face up to 6.5 h of exposure to temperatures
  above the accepted Threshold Limit Value for worker well-being. Workers adapt to
  hotter temperatures by altering the timing of their work shifts and breaks, indicating
  our sample is already adapting to increasing temperatures from climate and land
  use change. We also find differential adaptation strategies between those working
  only in open areas compared to those working in both forests and open areas, suggesting
  current acclimatization may be a factor in how people adapt. Our results suggest
  the need for adaptation and mitigation policies tailored to the unique constraints
  of rural workers that specifically incorporate extant adaptation strategies.'
