abstract: The historical disparities in the socio-demographic structure of New Orleans
  shaped the social vulnerability of local residents and their responses to Hurricane
  Katrina and its aftermath. These disparities, derived from race, class, gender,
  and age differences, have resulted in the uneven impact of the catastrophe on various
  communities in New Orleans, and importantly, their ability to recover. This article
  examines how the pre-existing social vulnerabilities within New Orleans interacted
  with the level of flood exposure to produce inequities in the socio-spatial patterns
  of recovery. Utilizing a combination of statistical and spatial approaches, we found
  a distinct geographic pattern to the recovery suggesting that the social burdens
  and impacts from Hurricane Katrina are uneven-the less flooded and less vulnerable
  areas are recovering faster than tracts with more vulnerable populations and higher
  levels of flooding. However, there is a more nuanced story, which suggests that
  it is neighborhoods in the mid-range of social vulnerability where recovery is lagging.
  While private resources and government programs help groups in the high and low
  categories of social vulnerability, the middle group shows the slowest rates of
  recovery. Further, it appears that the congressionally funded State of Louisiana
  Road Home Program (designed to provide compensation to Louisiana's homeowners who
  suffered impacts by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for the damage to their home) is
  not having a significant effect in stimulating recovery within the city. Â© 2010
