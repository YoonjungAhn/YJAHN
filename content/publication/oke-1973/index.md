abstract: The paper demonstrates the relationship existing between the size of a village,
  town or city (as measured by its population), and the magnitude of the urban heat
  island it produces. This is accomplished by analyzing data gathered by automobile
  traverses in 10 settlements on the St. Lawrence Lowland, whose populations range
  from 1000 to 2 million inhabitants. The locations of these settlements effectively
  eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously
  published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies
  to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the
  population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement
  with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately
  proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions
  the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and
  in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities.
