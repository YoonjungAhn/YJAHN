abstract: 'Despite all theoretically and empirically motivated criticism of GDP as
  a social welfare and progress indicator, its role in economics, public policy, politics
  and society continues to be influential. To resolve this paradox, one has to recognize
  that many economists accept the criticism of the GDP indicator but deny its relevance.
  This paper evaluates the reasons for denial. This entails five steps: (1) a brief
  review is offered of the extensive literature showing that GDP per capita (growth)
  is far from a robust indicator of social welfare (progress); (2) the influence of
  GDP information on economic decisions by firms, consumers, investors and governments
  is examined; (3) behavioural explanations for a widespread belief in the relevance
  of GDP are discussed; (4) the customary arguments in favour of the GDP indicator
  are analysed; and (5) proposed alternatives to GDP are evaluated. The paper ends
  with outlining the implications of giving less attention to GDP information in policy
  and politics. It is argued that removal of the information failure which GDP represents,
  in monitoring economic progress and guiding public policy, will lead to decisions
  and developments being more in line with improving human well-being. Moreover, ignoring
  GDP information is consistent with a perfectly neutral stance regarding economic
  (GDP) growth. Indeed, an unconditional anti- or pro-growth imperative acts as an
  unnecessary constraint on our search for human progress. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All
