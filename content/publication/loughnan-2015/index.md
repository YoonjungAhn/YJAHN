abstract: Older people have justifiably been highlighted as a high-risk group with
  respect to heat wave mortality and morbidity. However, there are older people living
  within the community who have developed adaptive and resilient environments around
  their home that provide some protection during periods of extreme heat. This study
  investigated the housing stock and self-reported thermal comfort of a group of older
  people living in a regional town in Australia during the summer of 2012. The results
  indicated that daily maximum living room temperature was not significantly correlated
  with outdoor temperature, and daily minimum living room temperature was very weakly
  correlated with outdoor temperature. Residents reported feeling comfortable when
  indoor temperature approximated 26 °C. As living room temperature increased, indoor
  thermal comfort decreased. Significant differences between indoor temperatures were
  noted for homes that were related to house characteristics such as the age of the
  house, the number of air-conditioning units, the pitch of the roof, home insulation
  and the number of heat-mitigation modifications made to the home. Brick veneer homes
  showed smaller diurnal changes in temperature than other building materials. With
  population ageing and the increasing focus on older people living in the community,
  the quality of the housing stock available to them will influence their risk of
  heat exposure during extreme weather.
