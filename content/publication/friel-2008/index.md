abstract: Although health has improved for many people, the extent of health inequities
  between and within countries is growing. Meanwhile, humankind is disrupting the
  global climate and other life-supporting environmental systems, thereby creating
  serious risks for health and wellbeing, especially in vulnerable populations but
  ultimately for everybody. Underlying determinants of health inequity and environmental
  change overlap substantially; they are signs of an economic system predicated on
  asymmetric growth and competition, shaped by market forces that mostly disregard
  health and environmental consequences rather than by values of fairness and support.
  A shift is needed in priorities in economic development towards healthy forms of
  urbanisation, more efficient and renewable energy sources, and a sustainable and
  fairer food system. Global interconnectedness and interdependence enable the social
  and environmental determinants of health to be addressed in ways that will increase
  health equity, reduce poverty, and build societies that live within environmental
  limits.
