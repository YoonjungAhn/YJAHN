abstract: 'The objective of this work is to better understand and summarize the mountain
  meteorological observations collected during the Science of Nowcasting Winter Weather
  for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympics (SNOW-V10) project that was supported
  by the Fog Remote Sensing and Modeling (FRAM) project. The Roundhouse (RND) meteorological
  station was located 1,856 m above sea level that is subject to the winter extreme
  weather conditions. Below this site, there were three additional observation sites
  at 1,640, 1,320, and 774 m. These four stations provided some or all the following
  measurements at 1 min resolution: precipitation rate (PR) and amount, cloud/fog
  microphysics, 3D wind speed (horizontal wind speed, U h; vertical air velocity,
  w a), visibility (Vis), infrared (IR) and shortwave (SW) radiative fluxes, temperature
  (T) and relative humidity with respect to water (RHw), and aerosol observations.
  In this work, comparisons are made to assess the uncertainties and variability for
  the measurements of Vis, RHw, T, PR, and wind for various winter weather conditions.
  The ground-based cloud imaging probe (GCIP) measurements of snow particles using
  a profiling microwave radiometer (PMWR) data have also been shown to assess the
  icing conditions. Overall, the conclusions suggest that uncertainties in the measurements
  of Vis, PR, T, and RH can be as large as 50, >60, 50, and >20 %, respectively, and
  these numbers may increase depending on U h, T, Vis, and PR magnitude. Variability
  of observations along the Whistler Mountain slope (~500 m) suggested that to verify
  the models, model space resolution should be better than 100 m and time scales better
  than 1 min. It is also concluded that differences between observed and model based
  parameters are strongly related to a model’s capability of accurate prediction of
  liquid water content (LWC), PR, and RHw over complex topography.'
