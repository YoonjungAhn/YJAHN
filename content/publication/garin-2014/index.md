abstract: Global population aging over recent years has been linked to poorer health
  outcomes and higher healthcare expenditure. Policies focusing on healthy aging are
  currently being developed but a complete understanding of health determinants is
  needed to guide these efforts. The built environment and other external factors
  have been added to the International Classification of Functioning as important
  determinants of health and disability. Although the relationship between the built
  environment and health has been widely examined in working age adults, research
  focusing on elderly people is relatively recent. In this review, we provide a comprehensive
  synthesis of the evidence on the built environment and health in the elderly.
