abstract: Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of potentially hazardous
  heat conditions across the United States, putting the incarcerated population of
  2 million at risk for heat-related health conditions. We evaluate the exposure to
  potentially hazardous heat for 4,078 continental US carceral facilities during 1982–2020.
  Results show that the number of hot days per year increased during 1982–2020 for
  1,739 carceral facilities, primarily located in the southern United States. State-run
  carceral facilities in Texas and Florida accounted for 52% of total exposure, despite
  holding 12% of all incarcerated people. This highlights the urgency for enhanced
  infrastructure, health system interventions and treatment of incarcerated people,
  especially under climate change.
