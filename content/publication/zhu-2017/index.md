abstract: It is well known that remote sensing techniques hold the potential to explore
  the spatial estimation of air temperature (T a) with fine spatial and temporal resolution
  across the world. However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere
  system and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime T a exclusively
  from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy
  sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of
  daytime T a under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging
  Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was
  demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic
  conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great
  Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous T a under clear
  sky conditions (T a,clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature
  (T a S) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (T s) retrieved
  from MOD06_L2 product. Then a regression model between T a,clear and T s was established,
  and the instantaneous T a under cloudy sky conditions (T a,cloudy) was estimated
  by applying the regression model to T s retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The
  results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved
  the accuracy of T a,clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 °C, RMSE = 2.50 °C, and B =
  0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 °C, RMSE = 2.56 °C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The
  T a,cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with T a observations in both regions
  with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated
  for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 °C and 2.91 °C, respectively. The accuracy of both
  T a,clear and T a,cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional
  statistical approaches that adopt ancillary T a measurements as training dataset.
  Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime T a under all-weather conditions entirely
  based on MODIS products. Land surface temperature Atmospheric temperature profile
