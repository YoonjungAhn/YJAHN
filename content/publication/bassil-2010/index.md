abstract: Increasing concern over the impact of hot weather on health has fostered
  the development of public health interventions to reduce heat-related health impacts.
  However, evidence of the effectiveness of such interventions is rarely cited for
  justification. Our objective was to review peer-reviewed and grey literature evaluating
  interventions aimed at reducing morbidity and/or mortality in populations during
  hot weather episodes. Among studies considering public risk perceptions, most respondents
  were aware when an extreme heat episode was occurring but did not necessarily change
  their practices, primarily due to a lack of self-perception as vulnerable and confusion
  about the appropriate actions to be taken. Among studies of health outcomes during
  and following heat episodes, studies were suggestive of positive impacts in reducing
  morbidity and mortality. While the limited evaluative work to date suggests a positive
  impact of public health interventions, concern persists about whether the most vulnerable
  groups, like the elderly and homeless, are being adequately reached.
