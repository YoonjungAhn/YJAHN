abstract: 'We discuss data quality and modeling issues inherent in the use of nationwide
  property data to value environmental amenities. By example of ZTRAX, a U.S.-wide
  real estate database, we identify challenges and propose guidance for: (1) the identification
  of armâ€™s-length sales, (2) the geo-location of parcels and buildings, (3) temporal
  linkages between transaction, assessor, and parcel data, (4) the identification
  of property types, such as single-family homes and vacant lands, and (5) dealing
  with missing or mismeasured data for standard housing attributes. We review current
  practice and show that how researchers address these issues can meaningfully influence
  research findings.'
