abstract: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low, high, extreme, and variable temperatures have been
  linked to multiple adverse health outcomes, particularly among the elderly and children.
  Recent models incorporating satellite remote sensing data have mitigated several
  limitations of previous studies, improving exposure assessment. This review focuses
  on these new temperature exposure models and their application in epidemiological
  studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Satellite observations of land surface temperature have
  been used to model air temperature across large spatial areas at high spatiotemporal
  resolutions. These models enable exposure assessment of entire populations and have
  been shown to reduce error in exposure estimates, thus mitigating downward bias
  in health effect estimates. SUMMARY: Satellite-based models improve our understanding
  of spatiotemporal variation in temperature and the associated health effects. Further
  research should focus on improving the resolution of these models, especially in
  urban areas, and increasing their use in epidemiological studies of direct temperature
  exposure and vector-borne diseases.'
