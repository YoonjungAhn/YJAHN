abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to develop a new environmental stress index
  (ESI) based on different parameters relating to heat stress. Meteorological measurements
  were taken in three climatic zones (hot/wet, hot/dry, and extremely hot/dry) for
  60 days, and a new stress index based on these databases was developed as follows:
  ESI = 0.63Ta - 0.03RH + 0.002SR + 0.0054(Ta·RH) - 0.073(0.1 + SR)-1. where Ta is
  the ambient temperature (°C), RH the relative humidity (%), and SR the solar radiation
  (W·m-1). The correlation coefficients between ESI and wet bulb globe temperature
  (WBGT) were very high (R2>0.981). Therefore, we conclude that ESI, based on fast
  response and the more commonly used accurate climatic microsensors (Ta, RH, SR)
  which can be combined in a small portable device, has the potential to be a practical
  alternative to the WBGT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.'
