abstract: ▪ Abstract GIS and related spatial analysis methods provide a set of tools
  for describing and understanding the changing spatial organization of health care,
  for examining its relationship to health outcomes and access, and for exploring
  how the delivery of health care can be improved. This review discusses recent literature
  on GIS and health care. It considers the use of GIS in analyzing health care need,
  access, and utilization; in planning and evaluating service locations; and in spatial
  decision support for health care delivery. The adoption of GIS by health care researchers
  and policy-makers will depend on access to integrated spatial data on health services
  utilization and outcomes and data that cut across human service systems. We also
  need to understand better the spatial behaviors of health care providers and consumers
  in the rapidly changing health care landscape and how geographic information affects
  these dynamic relationships.
