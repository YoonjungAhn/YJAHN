abstract: Regular diurnal and weekly cycles (WCs) in temperature provide valuable
  insights into the consequences of anthropogenic activity on the urban environment.
  Different locations experience a range of identified WCs and have very different
  structures. Two important sources of urban heat are those associated with the effect
  of large urban structures on the radiation budget and energy storage and those from
  the heat generated as a consequence of anthropogenic activity. The former forcing
  will remain relatively constant, but a WC will appear in the latter. WCs for specific
  times of day and the urban heat island (UHI) have not been analysed heretofore.
  We use three-hourly surface (2 m) temperature data to analyse the WCs of seven major
  Australian cities at different times of day and to determine to what extent one
  of our major city's (Melbourne) UHI exhibits a WC. We show that the WC of temperature
  in major cities differs according to the time of day and that the UHI intensity
  of Melbourne is affected on a WC. This provides crucial information that can contribute
  toward the push for healthier urban environments in the face of a more extreme climate.
