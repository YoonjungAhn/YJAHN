abstract: As digital social data have become increasingly ubiquitous, many have turned
  their attention to harnessing these massive data sets in order to produce purportedly
  more accurate and complete understandings of social processes. This intervention
  addresses the relationships between geography and big data and their intertwined
  futures. We focus on the impacts of an age of big data on the discipline of geography
  and geographic thought and methodology, as well as how geography might provide a
  useful lens through which to understand big data as a social phenomenon in its own
  right. Ultimately, we see significant potential in big data, but remain skeptical
  of the prevalent discourses around it, as they tend to obscure, more than reveal,
  the complexity of social and spatial processes. Â© The Author(s) 2013.
