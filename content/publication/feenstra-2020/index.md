abstract: While large-scale low-cost sensor networks are now recording air pollutant
  concentrations at finer spatial and temporal scales than previously measured, the
  large environmental data sets generated by these sensor networks can become overwhelming
  when considering the scientific skills required to analyze the data and generate
  interpretable results. This paper summarizes the development of an open-source R
  package (AirSensor) and interactive web application (DataViewer) designed to address
  the environmental data science challenges of visualizing and understanding local
  air quality conditions with community networks of low-cost air quality sensors.
  AirSensor allows users to access historical data, add spatial metadata, and create
  maps and plots for viewing community monitoring data. The DataViewer application
  was developed to incorporate the functionality and plotting functions of the R package
  into a user-friendly web experience that would serve as the primary source for data
  communication for community-based organizations and citizen scientists.
