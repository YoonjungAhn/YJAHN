abstract: The importance of proper access to urban amenities for elderly residents
  is evidenced in the literature. Among them, mobility infrastructure, particularly
  public transport (PT), is of pivotal significance due to its intermediary role in
  access to other amenities such as healthcare or urban green space (UGS). Given this,
  the inequity in access to PT could lead to more adverse impacts on society, especially
  if it coincides with inequities in other amenities. In response, we calculate local
  indicators of spatial association (LISA) between the elderly population and urban
  amenities of PT, healthcare, and UGS at the suburban level of Melbourne Metropolitan.
  We, then, introduce and develop a LISA-on-LISA model to analyze and reveal the coexistence
  of inequities at the suburban level. The results evidence the existence of inequity
  in access to PT for elderly cohorts. We further reveal the clusters of PT inequity
  which are, at the same time, experiencing healthcare and UGS inequities. The implications
  of the study for resource allocation and distribution in areas suffering from simultaneous
  inequity are discussed.
