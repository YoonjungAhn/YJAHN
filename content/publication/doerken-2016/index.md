abstract: 'Background: The case-crossover design is an attractive alternative to the
  classical case-control design which can be used to study the onset of acute events
  if the risk factors of interest vary in time. By comparing exposures within cases
  at different time periods, the case-crossover design does not rely on control subjects
  which can be difficult to acquire. However, using the standard method of maximum
  likelihood, resulting risk estimates can be heavily biased when the prevalence to
  risk factors is very low (or very high). Methods: To overcome the problem of low
  risk factor prevalences, penalized conditional logistic regression via the lasso
  (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) has been proposed in the literature
  as well as related methods such as the Firth correction. We apply and compare several
  penalized regression approaches in the context of a case-crossover analysis of the
  European Study of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (EuroSCAR; 1997-2001). Results:
  Out of 30 drugs, standard methods only correctly classified 17 drugs (including
  some highly implausible risk estimates), while penalized methods correctly classified
  22 drugs. Conclusion: Penalized methods generally yield better risk classifications
  and much more plausible risk estimates for the EuroSCAR study than standard methods.
  As these novel techniques can be easily implemented using available R packages,
  we encourage routine use of penalized conditional logistic regression for case-crossover
  data.'
