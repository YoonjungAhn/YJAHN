abstract: The humanity is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge, the largest
  global health emergency after the Second World War. During summer months, many countries
  in the northern hemisphere will also have to counteract an imminent seasonal phenomenon,
  the management of extreme heat events. The novelty this year concerns that the world
  population will have to deal with a new situation that foresees the application
  of specific measures, including adjunctive personal protective equipment (i.e. facemasks
  and gloves), in order to reduce the potential transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
  These measures should help to decrease the risk of the infection transmission but
  will also represent an aggravating factor to counteract the heat effects on the
  population health both at occupational and environmental level. The use of a specific
  heat health warning system with personalized information based on individual, behavioural
  and environmental characteristics represents a necessary strategy to help a fast
  adaptation of the population at a time where the priority is to live avoiding SARS-CoV-2
  infection.
