abstract: There is near unanimous scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions
  generated by human activity will change Earth's climate. The recent (globally averaged)
  warming by 0·5°C is partly attributable to such anthropogenic emissions. Climate
  change will affect human health in many ways—mostly adversely. Here, we summarise
  the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various
  health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming
  has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of
  future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has
  mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases,
  with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence.
  An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the
  social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation
  of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and
  will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.
