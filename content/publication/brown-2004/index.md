abstract: 'Although it is widely acknowledged that our understanding of environmental
  systems cannot be reduced to single predictions and unique explanations, determinism
  remains a common strategy in physical geography. This paper argues for explicit
  assessments of uncertainty in environmental data and models as a necessary, although
  not a sufficient, condition for balancing uncertain scientific arguments against
  uncertain social, ethical, moral and legal arguments in managing environmental systems.
  In particular, this paper aims to: (1) demonstrate the importance of assessing uncertainty
  within a realist research framework; (2) consider the nature of scientific uncertainty
  as the basis for developing methodologies that question belief; and (3) explore
  some important aspects of a methodology for evaluating uncertainties in environmental
  research. Â© Royal Geographical Society (with The Institute of British Geographers)
