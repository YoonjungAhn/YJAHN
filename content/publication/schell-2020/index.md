abstract: Urban areas are dynamic ecological systems defined by interdependent biological,
  physical, and social components. The emergent structure and heterogeneity of urban
  landscapes drives biotic outcomes in these areas, and such spatial patterns are
  often attributed to the unequal stratification of wealth and power in human societies.
  Despite these patterns, few studies have effectively considered structural inequalities
  as drivers of ecological and evolutionary outcomes and have instead focused on indicator
  variables such as neighborhood wealth. In this analysis, we explicitly integrate
  ecology, evolution, and social processes to emphasize the relationships that bind
  social inequities-specifically racism-and biological change in urbanized landscapes.
  We draw on existing research to link racist practices, including residential segregation,
  to the heterogeneous patterns of flora and fauna observed by urban ecologists. In
  the future, urban ecology and evolution researchers must consider how systems of
  racial oppression affect the environmental factors that drive biological change
  in cities. Conceptual integration of the social and ecological sciences has amassed
  considerable scholarship in urban ecology over the past few decades, providing a
  solid foundation for incorporating environmental justice scholarship into urban
  ecological and evolutionary research. Such an undertaking is necessary to deconstruct
  urbanization's biophysical patterns and processes, inform equitable and anti-racist
  initiatives promoting justice in urban conservation, and strengthen community resilience
  to global environmental change.
