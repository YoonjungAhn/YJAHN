abstract: To evaluate the impact of progressive urbanization with change in land use
  pattern on groundwater quality in a decade from 2010 to 2019, a study was attempted
  in urban agglomeration of Jaipur by using spatial and temporal remote sensing satellite
  data. A positive percentage change of 13.36 in built-up land and 21.17% decline
  in agriculture land within one decade shows the prodigious impact of urbanization
  in the study area. Groundwater samples were collected from the study area during
  premonsoon seasons of 2010 and 2019, and they were analyzed for physicochemical
  parameters to evaluate the impact of pollution on groundwater. An effort was made
  to discuss the change in water quality during decade via multivariate statistical
  methods like correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and graphical methods
  such as Piper trilinear diagram, Gibbs Ratio, and Soltan classification. To further
  assess the extent of effect of natural and anthropogenic processes, water quality
  index was calculated.
