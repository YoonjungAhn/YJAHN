abstract: Spatial climate datasets of 1981-2010 long-term mean monthly average dew
  point and minimum and maximum vapor pressure deficit were developed for the conterminous
  United States at 30-Arcsec (~800m) resolution. Interpolation of long-term averages
  (twelve monthly values per variable) was performed using PRISM (Parameter-elevation
  Relationships on Independent Slopes Model). Surface stations available for analysis
  numbered only 4,000 for dew point and 3,500 for vapor pressure deficit, compared
  to 16,000 for previouslydeveloped grids of 1981-2010 long-term mean monthly minimum
  and maximum temperature. Therefore, a form of Climatologically-Aided Interpolation
  (CAI) was used, in which the 1981-2010 temperature grids were used as predictor
  grids. For each grid cell, PRISM calculated a local regression function between
  the interpolated climate variable and the predictor grid. Nearby stations entering
  the regression were assigned weights based on the physiographic similarity of the
  station to the grid cell that included the effects of distance, elevation, coastal
  proximity, vertical atmospheric layer, and topographic position. Interpolation uncertainties
  were estimated using cross-validation exercises. Given that CAI interpolation was
  used, a new method was developed to allow uncertainties in predictor grids to be
  accounted for in estimating the total interpolation error. Local land use/land cover
  properties had noticeable effects on the spatial patterns of atmospheric moisture
  content and deficit. An example of this was relatively high dew points and low vapor
  pressure deficits at stations located in or near irrigated fields. The new grids,
  in combination with existing temperature grids, enable the user to derive a full
  suite of atmospheric moisture variables, such as minimum and maximum relative humidity,
  vapor pressure, and dew point depression, with accompanying assumptions. All of
  these grids are available online at http://prism. oregonstate.edu, and include 800-m
  and 4-km resolution data, images, metadata, pedigree information, and station inventory
  files.
