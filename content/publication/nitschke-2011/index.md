abstract: 'Background: Extreme heatwaves occurred in Adelaide, South Australia, in
  the summers of 2008 and 2009. Both heatwaves were unique in terms of their duration
  (15 days and 13 days respectively), and the 2009 heatwave was also remarkable in
  its intensity with a maximum temperature reaching 45.7°C. It is of interest to compare
  the health impacts of these two unprecedented heatwaves with those of previous heatwaves
  in Adelaide. Methods. Using case-series analysis, daily morbidity and mortality
  rates during heatwaves (35°C for three or more days) occurring in 2008 and 2009
  and previous heatwaves occurring between 1993 and 2008 were compared with rates
  during all non-heatwave days (1 October to 31 March). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
  were established for ambulance call-outs, hospital admissions, emergency department
  presentations and mortality. Dose response effects of heatwave duration and intensity
  were examined. Results: Ambulance call-outs during the extreme 2008 and 2009 events
  were increased by 10% and 16% respectively compared to 4.4% during previous heatwaves.
  Overall increases in hospital and emergency settings were marginal, except for emergency
  department presentations in 2008, but increases in specific health categories were
  observed. Renal morbidity in the elderly was increased during both heatwaves. During
  the 2009 heatwave, direct heat-related admissions increased up to 14-fold compared
  to a three-fold increase seen during the 2008 event and during previous heatwaves.
  In 2009, marked increases in ischaemic heart disease were seen in the 15-64 year
  age group. Only the 2009 heatwave was associated with considerable increases in
  total mortality that particularly affected the 15-64 year age group (1.37; 95% CI,
  1.09, 1.71), while older age groups were unaffected. Significant dose-response relationships
  were observed for heatwave duration (ambulance, hospital and emergency setting)
  and intensity (ambulance and mortality). Conclusions: While only incremental increases
  in morbidity and mortality above previous findings occurred in 2008, health impacts
  of the 2009 heatwave stand out. These findings send a signal that the intense and
  long 2009 heatwave may have exceeded the capacity of the population to cope. It
  is important that risk factors contributing to the adverse health outcomes are investigated
  to further improve preventive strategies. © 2011 Nitschke et al; licensee BioMed
