abstract: Adaptation is a process of deliberate change in anticipation of or in reaction
  to external stimuli and stress. The dominant research tradition on adaptation to
  environmental change primarily takes an actorcentered view, focusing on the agency
  of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the
  reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes
  a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological
  systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation.
  We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes
  and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental
  adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience
  for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system
  characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and
  social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional
  learning. Copyright Â©2007 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.
