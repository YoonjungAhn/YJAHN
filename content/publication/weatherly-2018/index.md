abstract: Human settlement plays a key role in understanding social processes such
  as urbanization and interactions between human and environmental systems but not
  much is known about the landscape evolution before the era of operational remote
  sensing technology. In this study, housing and property databases are used to create
  new gridded settlement layers describing human settlement processes at fine spatial
  and temporal resolution in the conterminous United States between 1810 and 2015.
  The main products are a raster composite layer representing the year of first settlement,
  and a raster time series of built-up intensity representing the sum of building
  areas in a pixel. Several accompanying uncertainty surfaces are provided to ensure
  the user is informed about inherent spatial, temporal and thematic uncertainty in
  the data. A validation study using high quality reference data confirms high levels
  of accuracy of the resulting data products. These settlement data will be of great
  interest in disciplines in which the long-term evolution of human settlement represents
  crucial information to explore novel research questions.
