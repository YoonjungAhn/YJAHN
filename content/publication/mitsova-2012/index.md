abstract: 'This article reports on the application of dasymetric mapping techniques
  to interpolate and disaggregate block group population counts to smaller areal units
  (i. e., tax parcels) and derive surface population models with more realistic representations
  of population distributions in our residential study area in Miami-Dade, Florida.
  Three methods of dasymetric interpolation were tested: (i) binary, (ii) three-class,
  and (iii) limiting variable. Our enhanced limiting variable approach introduced
  an adjustment factor for parcel vacancy rates in the dasymetric calculations, and
  applied dasymetric mapping techniques to disaggregate future population projections
  to the tax lot level of analysis. The limiting variable interpolation generated
  the lowest coefficient of variation (0.188), followed by the three-class interpolation
  (0.645). We also found that population densities vary substantially within land
  use classes of single family, medium density and high density classes, and these
  variations also highlighted the importance of incorporating vacancy rates when interpolating
  population counts to categorical land use data. Overall, the enhanced dasymetric
  mapping technique is particularly useful for examining the impact of sea-level rise
  as its derivatives are compatible with high resolution LiDAR and orthoimagery data.
  Coastal counties can also benefit from such high resolution surface population models
  to enhance the accuracy of hazard-related vulnerability assessments and to guide
  the development of relevant shore zone conservation and adaptation strategies. Â©
