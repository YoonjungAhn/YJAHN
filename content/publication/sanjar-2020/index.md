abstract: Accurate house price forecasts are very important for formulating national
  economic policies. In this paper, we offer an effective method to predict houses'
  sale prices. Our algorithm includes one-hot encoding to convert text data into numeric
  data, feature correlation to select only the most correlated variables, and a technique
  to overcome the missing data. Our approach is an effective way to handle missing
  data in large datasets with the K-nearest neighbor algorithm based on the most correlated
  features (KNN-MCF). As far as we are concerned, there has been no previous research
  that has focused on important features dealing with missing observations. Compared
  to the typical machine learning prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of
  the proposed method is 92.01% with the random forest algorithm, which is more efficient
  than the other methods.
