abstract: Sensitivity analysis (SA) is an essential tool for modelers to understand
  the influence of model parameters on model outputs. It is also increasingly used
  in developing and assessing physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models. For instance,
  several studies have applied global SA to reduce the computational burden in the
  Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo-based calibration process PBK models. Although
  several SA algorithms and software packages are available, no comprehensive software
  package exists that allows users to seamlessly solve differential equations in a
  PBK model, conduct and visualize SA results, and discriminate between the non-influential
  model parameters that can be fixed and those that need calibration. Therefore, we
  developed an R package, named pksensi, to make global SA more accessible in PBK
  modeling. This package can investigate both uncertainty and sensitivity in PBK models,
  including those with multivariate model outputs. It also includes functions to check
  the convergence of the global SA results. Overall, pksensi improves the user experience
  of performing global SA and can create robust and reproducible results for decision
  making in PBK model calibration.
