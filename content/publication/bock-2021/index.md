abstract: <p>The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed many social,
  economic, environmental, and healthcare determinants of health in New York City
  (NYC) and worldwide. COVID-19 potentially heightened the risk of heat-related health
  impacts in NYC, particularly on the most vulnerable communities, who often lack
  equitable access to adequate cooling mechanisms such as air conditioning (AC) and
  good quality green space. Here, we review some of the policies and tools which have
  been developed to reduce vulnerability to heat in NYC. We then present results from
  an online pilot survey of members of the environmental justice organization WE ACT
  for Environmental Justice (WE ACT) between July 11 and August 8, 2020, which asked
  questions to evaluate how those in Northern Manhattan coped with elevated summer
  heat in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also make some policy recommendations
  based on our initial findings. Results of our pilot survey suggest that people stayed
  indoors more due to COVID-19 and relied more on AC units to stay cool. Survey responses
  also indicated that some avoided visiting green spaces due to concerns around overcrowding
  and did not regularly frequent them due to the distance from their homes. The responses
  also demonstrate a potential racial disparity in AC access; AC ownership and access
  was highest amongst white and lowest amongst Latino/a/x and Black respondents. The
  impacts of COVID-19 have highlighted the need to accelerate efforts to improve preparedness
  for extreme heat like the City of New Yorkâ€™s AC and cooling center programs, heat
  ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) retrofitting, equitable green space expansion,
  and stronger environmental justice community networks and feedback mechanisms to
  hear from affected residents. Conducting a survey of this kind annually may provide
  an additional effective component of evaluating cooling initiatives in NYC.</p>
