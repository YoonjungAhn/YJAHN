abstract: Heat exposure of a population is often estimated by applying temperatures
  from outdoor monitoring stations. However, this can lead to exposure misclassification
  if residents do not live close to the monitoring station and temperature varies
  over small spatial scales due to land use/built environment variability, or if residents
  generally spend more time indoors than outdoors. Here, we compare summertime temperatures
  measured inside 145 homes in low-income households in Baltimore city with temperatures
  from the National Weather Service weather station in Baltimore. There is a large
  variation in indoor temperatures, with daily-mean indoor temperatures varying from
  10 °C lower to 10 °C higher than outdoor temperatures. Furthermore, there is only
  a weak association between the indoor and outdoor temperatures across all houses,
  indicating that the outdoor temperature is not a good predictor of the indoor temperature
  for the residences sampled. It is shown that much of the variation is due to differences
  in the availability of air conditioning (AC). Houses with central AC are generally
  cooler than outdoors (median difference of − 3.4 °C) while those with no AC are
  generally warmer (median difference of 1.4 °C). For the collection of houses with
  central or room AC, there is essentially no relationship between indoor and outdoor
  temperatures, but for the subset of houses with no AC, there is a weak relationship
  (correlation coefficient of 0.36). The results presented here suggest future epidemiological
  studies of indoor exposure to heat would benefit from information on the availability
  of AC within the population.
