abstract: 'Purpose: Rural residents may have lower access to and use of certain health
  information sources relative to urban residents. We investigated differences in
  information source access and use between rural and urban US adults and whether
  having low health literacy might exacerbate rural disparities in access to and use
  of health information. Methods: Six hundred participants (50% rural) completed an
  online survey about access and use of 25 health information sources. We used logistic
  regression models to test associations between rurality and access to and use of
  health information sources and whether rurality interacted with health literacy
  to predict the access and use. Findings: Compared to urban residents, rural residents
  had lower access to health information from sources including primary care providers,
  specialist doctors, blogs, and magazines, and less use of search engines. After
  accounting for sociodemographics, rural residents only had lower access to specialist
  doctors than urban residents. Rural residents with limited health literacy had lower
  access to mass media and scientific literature but higher use of corporations/companies
  than rural residents with adequate health literacy and urban residents regardless
  of health literacy level. Conclusions: Some differences in access to and use of
  health information sources may be accounted for by sociodemographic differences
  between rural and urban populations. There may be structural barriers such as shortage
  of specialist doctors and limited media exposure that make it harder for rural residents
  to access health information, especially those with limited health literacy.'
