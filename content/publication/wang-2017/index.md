abstract: '(1) Background: Tornadoes are one of the deadliest disasters but their
  health impacts in China are poorly investigated. This study aimed to assess the
  public health risks and impact of an EF-4 tornado outbreak in Funing, China; (2)
  Methods: A retrospective analysis on the characteristics of tornado-related deaths
  and injuries was conducted based on the database from the Funing’s Center for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC) and Funing People’s Hospital. A change-point time-series
  analysis of weekly incidence for the period January 2010 to September 2016 was used
  to identify sensitive infectious diseases to the tornado; (3) Results: The 75 to
  84 years old group was at the highest risk of both death (RR = 82.16; 95% CIs =
  19.66, 343.33) and injury (RR = 31.80; 95% CI = 17.26, 58.61), and females were
  at 53% higher risk of death than males (RR = 1.53; 95% CIs = 1.02, 2.29). Of the
  337 injuries, 274 injuries (81%) were minor. Most deaths occurred indoors (87%)
  and the head (74%) was the most frequent site of trauma during the tornado. Five
  diseases showed downward change-points; (4) Conclusions: The experience of the Funing
  tornado underscores the relative danger of being indoors during a tornado and is
  successful in avoiding epidemics post-tornado. Current international safety guidelines
  need modification when generalized to China.'
