abstract: Heat is a well-recognized hazard for workers in many outdoor settings, yet
  few investigations have compared the prevalence of outdoor work at the community
  level and rates of heat-related mortality and morbidity. This analysis examines
  whether heat-related health outcomes occur more frequently in communities with higher
  proportions of residents working in construction, agriculture, and other outdoor
  industries. Using 2005â€“2010 data from Los Angeles County, California, we analyze
  associations between community-level rates of deaths, emergency department (ED)
  visits, and hospitalizations during summer heat events and the prevalence of outdoor
  work. We find generally higher rates of heat-related ED visits and hospitalizations
  during summer heat events in communities with more residents working outdoors. Specifically,
  each percentage increase in residents working in construction resulted in an 8.1
  percent increase in heat-related ED visits and a 7.9 percent increase in heat-related
  hospitalizations, while each percentage increase in residents working in agriculture
  and related sectors resulted in a 10.9 percent increase in heat-related ED visits.
  The findings suggest that outdoor work may significantly influence the overall burden
  of heat-related morbidity at the community level. Public health professionals and
  healthcare providers should recognize work and employment as significant heat risk
  factors when preparing for and responding to extreme heat events.
