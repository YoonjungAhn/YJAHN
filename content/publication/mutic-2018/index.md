abstract: 'Background: Farmworkers working in hot and humid environments have an increased
  risk for heat-related illness (HRI) if their thermoregulatory capabilities are overwhelmed.
  The manifestation of heat-related symptoms can escalate into life-threatening events.
  Increasing ambient air temperatures resulting from climate change will only exacerbate
  HRI in vulnerable populations. We characterize HRI symptoms experienced by farmworkers
  in three Florida communities. Methods: A total of 198 farmworkers enrolled in 2015-2016
  were asked to recall if they experienced seven HRI symptoms during the previous
  work week. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs)
  and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between selected sociode-mographic
  characteristics and reporting three or more symptoms. Latent class analysis was
  used to identify classes of symptoms representing the HRI severity range. We examined
  sociodemographic characteristics of the farmworkers across the latent classes. Results:
  The mean age (±SD) of farmworkers was 38.0 (±8) years; the majority were female
  (60%) and Hispanic (86%). Most frequently reported symptoms were heavy sweating
  (66%), headache (58%), dizziness (32%), and muscle cramps (30%). Females had three
  times the odds of experiencing three or more symptoms (OR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.18-6.89).
  Symptoms fell into three latent classes, which included mild (heavy sweating; class
  probability = 54%), moderate (heavy sweating, headache, nausea, and dizziness; class
  probability = 24%), and severe (heavy sweating, headache, nausea, dizziness, muscle
  cramps; class probability = 22%). Conclusions: Farmworkers reported a high burden
  of HRI symptoms that appear to cluster in physiologic patterns. Unrecognized accumulation
  of symptoms can escalate into life-threatening situations if untreated. Our research
  can inform interventions to promote early recognition of HRI, on-site care, and
  appropriate occupational health policy. Administrative or engineering workplace
  controls may also reduce the manifestation of HRI.'
