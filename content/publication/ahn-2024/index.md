abstract: 'A collection of gridded surfaces at semi-decadal temporal resolution, showing
  the number of built-up properties for each of six thematic land use types per grid
  cell during the time period 1940-2020. These class-specific layers include: agricultural,
  commercial, industrial, owned-residential, rented-residential, recreational, governmental,
  and vacant properties. These gridded layers are based on property-level data and
  are part of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US).'
