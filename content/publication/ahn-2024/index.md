abstract: Understanding changes in the built environment is vital for sustainable
  urban development and disaster preparedness. Recent years have seen the emergence
  of a variety of global, continent-level, and nation-wide datasets related to the
  current state and the evolution of the built environment, human settlements or building
  stocks.&nbsp;However, such datasets may&nbsp;face limitations like incomplete coverage,
  sparse building information, coarse resolution, and limited timeframes. This study
  addresses these challenges by integrating three spatial datasets to create an extensive,
  attribute-rich sequence of settlement layers spanning 200 years for the contiguous
  U.S. This integration process involves complex data processing, merging property-level
  real estate, parcel, and remote sensing-based building footprint data, and creating
  gridded multi-temporal settlement layers. This effort unveils the latest edition
  (Version 2)&nbsp;of the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US),
  which includes the latest land use and structural information as of the year 2021.
  It enables detailed research on urban form and structure, helps assess and map the
  built environmentâ€™s risk to natural hazards, assists in population modeling, supports
  land use analysis, and aids health studies.
