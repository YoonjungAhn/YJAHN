abstract: 'AbstractThe Rapid Refresh (RAP), an hourly-updated assimilation and model
  forecast system, replaced the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) as an operational regional
  analysis and forecast system among the suite of models at the NOAA National Centers
  for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in 2012. The need for an effective hourly-updated
  assimilation and modeling system for the United States for situational awareness
  and related decision-making has continued to increase for various applications including
  aviation (and transportation in general), severe weather, and energy. The RAP is
  distinct from the previous RUC in three primary aspects: a larger geographical domain
  (covering North America); use of the community-based WRF-ARW (Weather Research and
  Forecasting â€“ Advanced Research WRF) model replacing the RUC forecast model; and
  use of the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation instead of the
  RUC three-dimensional variational (3DVar) assimilation. As part of the RAP development,
  modifications have been ...'
