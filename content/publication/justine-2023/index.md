abstract: Extreme heat is increasingly being acknowledged as a serious hazard to human
  health, through a combination of physiological responses to heat, expressed as dry
  and wet bulb temperatures, and personal factors. Here we present an analysis of
  the diurnal variability of dry and wet bulb temperatures using station data in South
  Asia during both regular and heatwave days. We find that diurnal cycles differ,
  with the daily maximum wet bulb temperature occurring several hours after the daily
  maximum dry bulb temperature. Using radiosonde profiles, we show that the timing
  and amplitude of the diurnal variability of wet bulb temperature can be explained
  by changes in boundary layer depths and water content. Physiological thresholds
  for uncompensable heat stress were exceeded even in the evenings, many hours after
  dry bulb temperature peaks. Cumulative exceedances occurred in 105 instances, corresponding
  to at least 300 hours of exposure to uncompensable heat stress in South Asia between
  1995 and 2020. We conclude that physiologically relevant thresholds provide a more
  robust way to estimate health impacts, and that wet bulb temperature alone is insufficient
  as an indicator of hazardous heat. Human physiological thresholds for uncompensable
  heat stress were exceeded for more than 300 hours in South Asia between 1995 and
  2020, including in the evenings, according to an analysis of the diurnal variability
  of wet and dry bulb temperatures in station data.
