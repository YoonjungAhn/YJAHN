abstract: Population estimates are critical for government services, development projects,
  and public health campaigns. Such data are typically obtained through a national
  population and housing census. However, population estimates can quickly become
  inaccurate in localized areas, particularly where migration or displacement has
  occurred. Some conflict-affected and resource-poor countries have not conducted
  a census in over 10 y. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate population
  numbers in small areas based on enumeration data from sample areas and nationwide
  information about administrative boundaries, building locations, settlement types,
  and other factors related to population density. We demonstrated this model by estimating
  population sizes in every 10- m grid cell in Nigeria with national coverage. These
  gridded population estimates and areal population totals derived from them are accompanied
  by estimates of uncertainty based on Bayesian posterior probabilities. The model
  had an overall error rate of 67 people per hectare (mean of absolute residuals)
  or 43% (using scaled residuals) for predictions in out-of-sample survey areas (approximately
  3 ha each), with increased precision expected for aggregated population totals in
  larger areas. This statistical approach represents a significant step toward estimating
  populations at high resolution with national coverage in the absence of a complete
  and recent census, while also providing reliable estimates of uncertainty to support
  informed decision making.
