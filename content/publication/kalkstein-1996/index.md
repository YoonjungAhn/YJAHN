abstract: Despite recent advances in the classification of synoptic-scale events,
  there remains the need for development of a simple, automated, continental-scale
  air mass-based procedure. We present a new method of analysis to identify resident
  air masses at first-order weather stations to facilitate intersite comparison of
  daily air masses across a very large region. The 'spatial synoptic classification'
  (SSC) requires initial identification of the major air masses and their typical
  meteorological characteristics at each site. 'Seed days', which exhibit these typical
  characteristics for each air mass, are used as input for a linear discriminant function
  analysis, which produces a daily categorization of air masses with spatially continuous
  results. A second discriminant function analysis is used to determine whether a
  day is to be considered transitional between air masses. Using the SSC, air-mass
  frequencies were developed for winter across the USA east of the Rockies, and rates
  of modification were determined as each air mass traversed the region. The impact
  of snow cover on modification rates was determined by comparing two winter months
  with very different snow cover characteristics across the area. Keeping other factors
  constant, it appears that extended snow cover can reduce the temperature of a dry
  polar air mass by up to 11Â°C.
