abstract: Precision governance is an administrative capacity in which policy decisions
  are enhanced with information about individual and collective preferences and contexts.
  We introduce the prospects for precision governance of natural hazards through the
  use of both big and individual data technologies, describing what is enabled and
  what concerns arise with their use. We ground our perspective with a topical focus
  on mitigating the health risks of high temperatures in the chronically hot setting
  of Phoenix, Arizona, USA. A study examining individually experienced temperature
  data provides compelling evidence that the transition towards data-driven precision
  governance will enhance hazard preparedness and response efforts.
