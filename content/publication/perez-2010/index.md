abstract: We study a family of \"classical\" orthogonal polynomials which satisfy
  (apart from a 3-term recurrence relation) an eigenvalue problem with a differential
  operator of Dunkl-type. These polynomials can be obtained from the little $q$-Jacobi
  polynomials in the limit $q=-1$. We also show that these polynomials provide a nontrivial
  realization of the Askey-Wilson algebra for $q=-1$.
