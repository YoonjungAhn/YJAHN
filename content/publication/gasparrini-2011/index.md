abstract: Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) represent a modeling framework
  to flexibly describe associations showing potentially non-linear and delayed effects
  in time series data. This methodology rests on the definition of a crossbasis, a
  bi-dimensional functional space expressed by the combination of two sets of basis
  functions, which specify the relationships in the dimensions of predictor and lags,
  respectively. This framework is implemented in the R package dlnm, which provides
  functions to perform the broad range of models within the DLNM family and then to
  help interpret the results, with an emphasis on graphical representation. This paper
  offers an overview of the capabilities of the package, describing the conceptual
  and practical steps to specify and interpret DLNMs with an example of application
  to real data.
