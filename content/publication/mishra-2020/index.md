abstract: Intensive irrigation in India has been demonstrated to decrease surface
  temperature, but the influence of irrigation on humidity and extreme moist heat
  stress is not well understood. Here we analysed a combination of in situ and satellite-based
  datasets and conducted meteorological model simulations to show that irrigation
  modulates extreme moist heat. We found that intensive irrigation in the region cools
  the land surface by 1 °C and the air by 0.5 °C. However, the decreased sensible
  heat flux due to irrigation reduces the planetary boundary layer height, which increases
  low-level moist enthalpy. Thus, irrigation increases the specific and relative humidity,
  which raises the moist heat stress metrics. Intense irrigation over the region results
  in increased moist heat stress in India, Pakistan, and parts of Afghanistan—affecting
  about 37–46 million people in South Asia—despite a cooler land surface. We suggest
  that heat stress projections in India and other regions dominated by semi-arid and
  monsoon climates that do not include the role of irrigation overestimate the benefits
  of irrigation on dry heat stress and underestimate the risks.
