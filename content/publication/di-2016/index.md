abstract: A number of models have been developed to estimate PM2.5 exposure, including
  satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) models, land-use regression, or chemical
  transport model simulation, all with both strengths and weaknesses. Variables like
  normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface reflectance, absorbing aerosol
  index, and meteoroidal fields are also informative about PM2.5 concentrations. Our
  objective is to establish a hybrid model which incorporates multiple approaches
  and input variables to improve model performance. To account for complex atmospheric
  mechanisms, we used a neural network for its capacity to model nonlinearity and
  interactions. We used convolutional layers, which aggregate neighboring information,
  into a neural network to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation. We trained
  the neural network for the continental United States from 2000 to 2012 and tested
  it with left out monitors. Ten-fold cross-validation revealed a good model performance
  with a total R2 of 0.84 on the left out monitors. Regional R2 could be even higher
  for the Eastern and Central United States. Model performance was still good at low
  PM2.5 concentrations. Then, we used the trained neural network to make daily predictions
  of PM2.5 at 1 km Ã— 1 km grid cells. This model allows epidemiologists to access
  PM2.5 exposure in both the short-term and the long-term.
