 abstract = {This paper reviews existing population estimation methods in the GIS and remote sensing literatures. The methods can be grouped into two categories: areal interpolation methods and statistical modeling methods. Areal interpolation methods can be further separated into two categories depending on whether ancillary information is used. Statistical modeling methods can be further grouped into five categories based on the relationship between populations and urban areas, land uses, dwelling units, image pixel characteristics, or other physical or socioeconomic characteristics.
