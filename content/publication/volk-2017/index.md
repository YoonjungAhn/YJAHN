abstract: This chapter provides an overview of land use and land cover change in Florida
  over the past 100 years and a summary of how it may change in the future. We begin
  by providing a baseline description of Florida's pre-1900 land cover, natural resource
  distribution, and biodiversity. This is followed by a description of major land
  use changes and trends related to transportation, agriculture, mining, urbanization,
  tourism, disruption of natural processes, and conservation from 1900 to the present.
  We also describe changes in land use and land cover caused by climate change. The
  chapter concludes with a discussion of current land use and land cover patterns,
  and the potential impacts of climate change and continued human population growth
  on the remaining natural and rural landscapes in Florida. Much has changed in Florida
  over the last century due to a combination of wetland draining, agriculture conversion,
  urban development, and establishment of several dominant exotic plant species, as
  well as accelerating sea level rise and shifting climate zones due to climate change.
  Key Messages • Land cover and land use within Florida have changed dramatically
  since pre-settlement times, primarily due to human activities, with significant
  impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. • Climate-related impacts on land cover,
  resulting from human-caused climate change, have also been documented in Florida.
  • Patterns of historic land use and land cover change are important to quantify
  and visualize so that we can assess the degree to which natural systems have been
  impacted and changed by human activities. • Florida still has highly significant
  cultural and natural landscapes, which provide important services to people, in
  addition to possessing intrinsic values separate from their value to humans. • As
  future changes continue to occur as a result of climate change and population growth,
  it will be more important than ever to conduct careful land use planning and management
  so that we can preserve natural and cultural resources, and maintain the qualities
  that make Florida the special place that it is today.
