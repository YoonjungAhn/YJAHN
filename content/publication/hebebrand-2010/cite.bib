 abstract = {Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is a way of taking account of uncertainty about model form or assumptions and propagating it through to inferences about an unknown quantity of interest such as a population parameter, a future observation, or the future payoff or cost of a course of action. The BMA posterior distribution of the quantity of interest is a weighted average of its posterior distributions under each of the models considered, where a modelâ€™s weight is equal to the posterior probability that it is correct, given that one of the models considered is correct.},
