abstract: This paper presents an update and extension of HYDE, the History Database
  of the Global Environment (HYDE version 3.2). HYDE is an internally consistent combination
  of historical population estimates and allocation algorithms with time-dependent
  weighting maps for land use. Categories include cropland, with new distinctions
  for irrigated and rain-fed crops (other than rice) and irrigated and rain-fed rice.
  Grazing lands are also provided, divided into more intensively used pasture and
  less intensively used rangeland, and further specified with respect to conversion
  of natural vegetation to facilitate global change modellers. Population is represented
  by maps of total, urban, rural population, population density and built-up area.
  The period covered is 10 000 before Common Era (BCE) to 2015 Common Era (CE). All
  data can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-25g-gez3. We estimate
  that global population increased from 4.4 million people (we also estimate a lower
  range <0.01 and an upper range of 8.9 million) in 10 000 BCE to 7.257 billion in
  2015 CE, resulting in a global population density increase from 0.03 persons (or
  capita, in short cap) km-2 (range 0-0.07) to almost 56 cap km-2 respectively. The
  urban built-up area evolved from almost zero to roughly 58 Mha in 2015 CE, still
  only less than 0.5 % of the total land surface of the globe. Cropland occupied approximately
  less than 1 % of the global land area (13 037 Mha, excluding Antarctica) for a long
  time period until 1 CE, quite similar to the grazing land area. In the following
  centuries the share of global cropland slowly grew to 2.2 % in 1700 CE (ca. 293
  Mha, uncertainty range 220-367 Mha), 4.4 % in 1850 CE (578 Mha, range 522-637 Mha)
  and 12.2 % in 2015 CE (ca. 1591 Mha, range 1572-1604 Mha). Cropland can be further
  divided into rain-fed and irrigated land, and these categories can be further separated
  into rice and non-rice. Rain-fed croplands were much more common, with 2.2 % in
  1700 CE (289 Mha, range 217-361 Mha), 4.2 % (549 Mha, range 496-606 Mha) in 1850
  CE and 10.1 % (1316 Mha, range 1298-1325 Mha) in 2015 CE, while irrigated croplands
  used less than 0.05 % (4.3 Mha, range 3.1-5.5 Mha), 0.2 % (28 Mha, range 25-31 Mha)
  and 2.1 % (277 Mha, range 273-278 Mha) in 1700, 1850 and 2015 CE, respectively.
  We estimate the irrigated rice area (paddy) to be 0.1 % (13 Mha, range 9-16 Mha)
  in 1700 CE, 0.2 % (28 Mha, range 26-31 Mha) in 1850 CE and 0.9 % (118 Mha, range
  117-120 Mha) in 2015 CE. The estimates for land used for grazing are much more uncertain.
  We estimate that the share of grazing land grew from 5.1 % in 1700 CE (667 Mha,
  range 507-820 Mha) to 9.6 % in 1850 CE (1192 Mha, range 1068-1304 Mha) and 24.9
  % in 2015 CE (3241 Mha, range 3211-3270 Mha). To aid the modelling community we
  have divided land used for grazing into more intensively used pasture, less intensively
  used converted rangeland and less or unmanaged natural unconverted rangeland. Pasture
  occupied 1.1 % in 1700 CE (145 Mha, range 79-175 Mha), 1.9 % in 1850 CE (253 Mha,
  range 218-287 Mha) and 6.0 % (787 Mha, range 779-795 Mha) in 2015 CE, while rangelands
  usually occupied more space due to their occurrence in more arid regions and thus
  lower yields to sustain livestock. We estimate converted rangeland at 0.6 % in 1700
  CE (82 Mha range 66-93 Mha), 1 % in 1850 CE (129 Mha range 118-136 Mha) and 2.4
  % in 2015 CE (310 Mha range 306-312 Mha), while the unconverted natural rangelands
  occupied approximately 3.4 % in 1700 CE (437 Mha, range 334-533 Mha), 6.2 % in 1850
  CE (810 Mha, range 733-881 Mha) and 16.5 % in 2015 CE (2145 Mha, range 2126-2164
  Mha).
