abstract: The objective of this study is to introduce a new procedure to determine
  the impact of climate on human mortality with the use of a synoptic climatological
  approach. The holistic nature of synoptic categories allows for the simultaneous
  evaluation of numerous weather elements as they realistically appear within air
  masses. In addition, this approach allows for a better distinction between pollution-induced
  mortality and weather-induced mortality. A synoptic categorization was performed
  for St. Louis, Missouri, and each category was evaluated in terms of its mean daily
  mortality. Of 10 summer categories found in St. Louis, one possessed the highest
  mean mortality by far, and 8 of the top 10 mortality days in St. Louis occurred
  when this category was present. Further analysis determined that long, consecutive
  day periods of this hot, oppressive category are associated with a continuing rise
  in mortality. It was determined that the procedure described here has the potential
  to be used in a weather/mortality watch- warning system. Finally, it appears that
  day-to-day mortality fluctuations are much more sensitive to weather than to pollution
  concentrations, as the oppressive category associated with the greatest mortality
  possessed levels of six major pollutants that were not noteworthy.
