abstract: Aggregated demographic datasets are associated with analytical and cartographic
  problems due to the arbitrary nature of areal unit partitioning. This article describes
  a methodology for generating a surface-based representation of population that mitigates
  these problems. This methodology uses dasymetric mapping and incorporates areal
  weighting and empirical sampling techniques to assess the relationship between categorical
  ancillary data and population distribution. As a demonstration, a 100-meter-resolution
  population surface is generated from U.S. Census block group data for the southeast
  Pennsylvania region. Remote-sensing-derived urban land-cover data serve as ancillary
  data in the dasymetric mapping. Â© 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.
