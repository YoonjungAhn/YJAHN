abstract: Higher temperatures are associated with morbidity and mortality. Most epidemiological
  studies use outdoor temperature data, however, people spend most of their time indoors.
  Indoor temperatures and determinants of indoor temperatures have rarely been studied
  on a large scale. We measured living room and bedroom temperature in 113 homes of
  elderly subjects, as well as outdoor temperatures, in two cities in the Netherlands.
  Linear regression was used to determine the influence of building characteristics
  on indoor living room and bedroom temperatures in the warm episode. During the warm
  episode, indoor temperatures were higher during the night and lower during the day
  than outdoor temperatures. Indoor temperatures on average exceeded outdoor temperatures.
  The weekly average indoor temperature in living rooms varied between 23.1 and 30.2 °C.
  Dwellings that warmed up easily, also cooled down more easily. Outdoor and indoor
  temperatures were moderately correlated (R2 = 0.36 and 0.34 for living rooms and
  bedrooms, respectively). Building year before 1930 and rooms being located on the
  top floor were associated with higher indoor temperatures. Green in the vicinity
  was associated with lower temperatures in bedrooms. This study shows that indoor
  temperatures vary widely between dwellings, and are determined by outdoor temperatures
  and building characteristics. As most people, especially the elderly, spend most
  of the time indoor, indoor temperature is a more exact predictor of heat exposure
  than outdoor temperature. The importance of mitigating high indoor temperatures
  will be more important in the future because of higher temperatures due to climate
  change.
