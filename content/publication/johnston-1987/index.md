abstract: Previous editions were abstracted as 80D/3672 and 83D/2243. This further
  edition takes account of the more recent advances in geographical scholarship, the
  implications for researchers of the political response to economic recession, and
  the increased interest in the history of human geography and new insights it has
  brought to the processes of change. -J.Sheail
