abstract: Recent advances in citizen weather station (CWS) networks, with data accessible
  via crowd-sourcing, provide relevant climatic information to urban scientists and
  decision makers. In particular, CWS can provide long-term measurements of urban
  heat and valuable information on spatio-temporal heterogeneity related to horizontal
  heat advection. In this study, we make the first compilation of a quasi-climatologic
  dataset covering six years (2015-2020) of hourly near-surface air temperature measurements
  obtained via 1560 suitable CWS in a domain covering south-east England and Greater
  London. We investigated the spatio-temporal distribution of urban heat and the influences
  of local environments on climate, captured by CWS through the scope of Local Climate
  Zones (LCZ) - a land-use land-cover classification specifically designed for urban
  climate studies. We further calculate, for the first time, the amount of advected
  heat captured by CWS located in Greater London and the wider south east England
  region. We find that London is on average warmer by about 1.0 ° C-1.5 ° C than the
  rest of south-east England. Characteristics of the southern coastal climate are
  also captured in the analysis. We find that on average, urban heat advection (UHA)
  contributes to 0.22 ± 0.96 ° C of the total urban heat in Greater London. Certain
  areas, mostly in the centre of London are deprived of urban heat through advection
  since heat is transferred more to downwind suburban areas. UHA can positively contribute
  to urban heat by up to 1.57 ° C, on average and negatively by down to -1.21 ° C.
  Our results also show an important degree of inter- and intra-LCZ variability in
  UHA, calling for more research in the future. Nevertheless, we already find that
  UHA can impact green areas and reduce their cooling benefit. Such outcomes show
  the added value of CWS when considering future urban design.
