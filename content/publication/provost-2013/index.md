abstract: Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions
  are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting
  data science as a hot - even \"sexy\" - career choice. However, there is confusion
  about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment
  as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there
  are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science.
  One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important
  concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making.
  Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with
  the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals
  of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely
  is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an
  academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it
  is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts,
  and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science.
  Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data
  science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable
  calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses
  all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental
  principles underlying data science.
