abstract: Information inequity is a central concern of the digital age. Many recognize
  the role of public libraries in bridging such inequities. Unfortunately, however,
  public libraries are often limited by the funding available to them. This study
  used a geographic information system (GIS), inequality measures, and multiple regressions
  to analyze statistics from the Public Libraries Survey (PLS) collected by the National
  Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and from census tract data. It evaluated
  the levels of public library funding and services and tested how these resources
  vary with neighborhood income and urbanization levels. This is one of the few nationwide
  multivariate studies of neighborhood-level variations. The study revealed significant
  funding and service variations across the nation's 9000 library systems. Distributions
  of digital materials, full-time staff with a master's degree in library and information
  science, and library programs were especially disparate. Library systems in lower-income
  or rural neighborhoods were relatively less funded and offered fewer information
  resources. Interestingly, the only variable that was not significantly associated
  with neighborhood income was the number of public Internet terminals. This suggests
  that recent funding and research efforts may have made a difference. Similar funding
  efforts are encouraged for other types of library resources such as staff education
  and training. In light of the prevalent disparities in resource levels across neighborhoods,
  the study calls for a fundamental evaluation of the funding mechanisms for libraries.
  Also, information behavior research should investigate how this structural information
  inequity affects individuals' information use decisions. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.
