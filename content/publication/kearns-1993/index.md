abstract: An engagement with public health concerns and aspects of social theory such
  as the structure/agency debate is crucial to medical geography. The imperatives
  underlying this engagement center on place, a geographical concept which is prominent
  in both social theory and recent health philosophy. Without detracting from its
  distinguished heritage, this reformed medical geography will analyze issues such
  as the consequences of illness and health service provision for both personal well-being
  and the collective experience of place by communities. Â© 1993 Taylor & Francis Group,
