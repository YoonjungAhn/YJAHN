abstract: In recent years, the collection and utilisation of crowdsourced data has
  gained attention in atmospheric sciences and citizen weather stations (CWS), i.e.,
  privately-owned weather stations whose owners share their data publicly via the
  internet, have become increasingly popular. This is particularly the case for cities,
  where traditional measurement networks are sparse. Rigorous quality control (QC)
  of CWS data is essential prior to any application. In this study, we present the
  QC package “CrowdQC+,” which identifies and removes faulty air-temperature (ta)
  data from crowdsourced CWS data sets, i.e., data from several tens to thousands
  of CWS. The package is a further development of the existing package “CrowdQC.”
  While QC levels and functionalities of the predecessor are kept, CrowdQC+ extends
  it to increase QC performance, enhance applicability, and increase user-friendliness.
  Firstly, two new QC levels are introduced. The first implements a spatial QC that
  mainly addresses radiation errors, the second a temporal correction of the data
  regarding sensor-response time. Secondly, new functionalities aim at making the
  package more flexible to apply to data sets of different lengths and sizes, enabling
  also near-real time application. Thirdly, additional helper functions increase user-friendliness
  of the package. As its predecessor, CrowdQC+ does not require reference meteorological
  data. The performance of the new package is tested with two 1-year data sets of
  CWS data from hundreds of “Netatmo” CWS in the cities of Amsterdam, Netherlands,
  and Toulouse, France. Quality-controlled data are compared with data from networks
  of professionally-operated weather stations (PRWS). Results show that the new package
  effectively removes faulty data from both data sets, leading to lower deviations
  between CWS and PRWS compared to its predecessor. It is further shown that CrowdQC+
  leads to robust results for CWS networks of different sizes/densities. Further development
  of the package could include testing the suitability of CrowdQC+ for other variables
  than ta, such as air pressure or specific humidity, testing it on data sets from
  other background climates such as tropical or desert cities, and to incorporate
  added filter functionalities for further improvement. Overall, CrowdQC+ could lead
  the way to utilise CWS data in world-wide urban climate applications.
