abstract: On August 1, 2001, Korey Stringer, a Pro Bowl offensive tackle for the Minnesota
  Vikings, became the first and to date the only professional American football player
  to die from exertional heat stroke (EHS). The death helped raise awareness of the
  dangers of exertional heat illnesses in athletes and prompted the development of
  heat safety policies at the professional, collegiate, and interscholastic levels.
  Despite the public awareness of this death, no published study has examined in detail
  the circumstances surrounding Stringer's fatal EHS. Using the well-documented details
  of the case, our study shows that Stringer's fatal EHS was the result of a combination
  of physiological limitations, organizational and treatment failings, and extreme
  environmental conditions. The COMfort FormulA (COMFA) energy budget model was used
  to assess the relative importance of several extrinsic factors on Stringer's EHS,
  including weather conditions, clothing insulation, and activity levels. We found
  that Stringer's high-intensity training in relation to the oppressive environmental
  conditions was the most prominent factor in producing dangerous, uncompensable heat
  stress conditions and that the full football uniform played a smaller role in influencing
  Stringer's energy budget. The extreme energy budget levels that led to the fatal
  EHS would have been avoided according to our modeling through a combination of reduced
  intensity and lower clothing insulation. Finally, a long delay in providing medical
  treatment made the EHS fatal. These results highlight the importance of modern heat
  safety guidelines that provide controls on extrinsic factors, such as the adjustment
  of duration and intensity of training along with protective equipment modifications
  based on environmental conditions and the presence of an emergency action plan focused
  on rapid recognition and immediate on-site aggressive cooling of EHS cases.
