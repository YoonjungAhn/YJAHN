abstract: 'Background: Increasing number of studies have linked air pollution exposure
  with renal function decline and disease. However, there is a lack of data on its
  impact among end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients and its potential modifying
  effect from extreme heat events (EHE). Methods: Fresenius Kidney Care records from
  28 selected northeastern US counties were used to pool daily all-cause mortality
  (ACM) and all-cause hospital admissions (ACHA) counts. County-level daily ambient
  PM2.5 and ozone (O3) were estimated using a high-resolution spatiotemporal coupled
  climate-air quality model and matched to ESKD patients based on ZIP codes of treatment
  sites. We used time-stratified case-crossover analyses to characterize acute exposures
  using individual and cumulative lag exposures for up to 3 days (Lag 0–3) by using
  a distributed lag nonlinear model framework. We used a nested model comparison hypothesis
  test to evaluate for interaction effects between air pollutants and EHE and stratification
  analyses to estimate effect measures modified by EHE days. Results: From 2001 to
  2016, the sample population consisted of 43,338 ESKD patients. We recorded 5217
  deaths and 78,433 hospital admissions. A 10-unit increase in PM2.5 concentration
  was associated with a 5% increase in ACM (rate ratio [RRLag0–3]: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.10)
  and same-day O3 (RRLag0: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03) after adjusting for extreme heat
  exposures. Mortality models suggest evidence of interaction and effect measure modification,
  though not always simultaneously. ACM risk increased up to 8% when daily ozone concentrations
  exceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standards established by the United States,
  but the increases in risk were considerably higher during EHE days across lag periods.
  Conclusion: Our findings suggest interdependent effects of EHE and air pollution
  among ESKD patients for all-cause mortality risks. National level assessments are
  needed to consider the ESKD population as a sensitive population and inform treatment
  protocols during extreme heat and degraded pollution episodes.'
