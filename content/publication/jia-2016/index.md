abstract: Spatial techniques and fine-scale geographic data may be combined in a variety
  of innovative ways to serve high-resolution population modeling efforts at local
  scales, which has been further facilitated by growing computation power and access
  to open-source spatial data. Previous work has highlighted the importance of a dasymetric
  approach to produce a parcel-based high-resolution gridded population surface (HGPS).
  In this study, we investigate the application of land-cover data integrated with
  the parcel-based HGPS to further improve the accuracy of the HGPS. Consideration
  is given to twelve combinations made by three land cover strategies (1- no land
  cover class, 2- five separate classes, and 3- three combined classes) and four property
  type strategies (1- seven types from an empirical study, 2- eight residential types,
  3- seventeen types within Alachua County, and 4- twenty-five types within Florida).
  Results from different strategies are statistically compared with the most significant
  combination identified as three combined land-cover classes (heavy vegetation, 0-50%
  and >50-100% impervious surface) and with seven property types from the empirical
  study (single family, mobile family, multi-family (â‰¥10 and <10 units), condominiums,
  mobile homes parks, and homes for the aged). A final data set named the Enhanced
  HGPS (E-HGPS) is created for Alachua County, Florida, with a distribution of population
  counts at the scale of individual housing units. This study highlights an innovative
  approach to incorporating land-cover and parcel data for the purpose of spatial
  population modeling, and holds potential to broaden the E-HGPS to a state or regional
  scope.
