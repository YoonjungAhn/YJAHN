abstract: Unusually hot weather is a major concern to public health as well as other
  systems (e.g., ecological, economical, energy). This study utilized spatially continuous
  and homogenized observational surface climate data to examine changes in the regularity
  of heat waves in the continental United States. This included the examination of
  heat waves according only to daytime temperatures, nighttime temperatures, and both
  daytime and nighttime temperatures. Results confirmed a strong increase in the prevalence
  of heat waves between the mid-1970s and the dataset end (2015), and that increase
  was preceded by a mild decrease since the dataset beginning (1948). Results were
  unclear whether the prevalence of nighttime or simultaneous daytime-nighttime heat
  waves increased the most, but it was clear that increases were largest in the summer.
  The largest gains occurred in the West and Southwest, and a ''warming hole'' was
  most conspicuous in the northern Great plains. The changes in heat wave prevalence
  were similar to changes in the mean temperatures, and more so in the daytime heat
  waves. Daytime and nighttime heat waves coincided with one another more frequently
  in recent years than they did in the 1970s. Some parts of the United States (West
  Coast) were more likely than other parts to experience daytime and nighttime heat
  waves simultaneously. While linear trends were not sensitive to the climate dataset,
  trend estimation method, or heat wave definition, they were mildly sensitive to
  the start and end dates and extremely sensitive to the climate base period method
  (fixed in time or directly preceding any given heat wave).
