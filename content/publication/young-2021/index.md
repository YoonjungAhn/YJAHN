abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polybrominated diphenyl ethers
  (PBDEs), and organophosphate esters (OPEs) are found in building materials and associated
  with thyroid disease, infertility, and impaired development. This study's objectives
  were to (1) compare levels of PFAS, PBDEs, and OPEs in dust from spaces with conventional
  versus “healthier” furniture and carpet, and (2) identify other product sources
  of flame retardants in situ. We measured 15 PFAS, 8 PBDEs, and 19 OPEs in dust from
  offices, common areas, and classrooms having undergone either no intervention (conventional
  rooms in older buildings meeting strict fire codes; n = 12), full “healthier” materials
  interventions (rooms with “healthier” materials in buildings constructed more recently
  or gut-renovated; n = 7), or partial interventions (other rooms with at least “healthier”
  foam furniture but more potential building contamination; n = 28). We also scanned
  all materials for bromine and phosphorus as surrogates of PBDEs and OPEs respectively,
  using x-ray fluorescence. In multilevel regression models, rooms with full “healthier”
  materials interventions had 78% lower dust levels of PFAS than rooms with no intervention
  (p < 0.01). Rooms with full “healthier” interventions also had 65% lower OPE levels
  in dust than rooms with no intervention (p < 0.01) and 45% lower PBDEs than rooms
  with only partial interventions (p < 0.10), adjusted for covariates related to insulation,
  electronics, and furniture. Bromine loadings from electronics in rooms were associated
  with PBDE concentrations in dust (p < 0.05), and the presence of exposed insulation
  was associated with OPE dust concentrations (p < 0.001). Full “healthier” materials
  renovations successfully reduced chemical classes in dust. Future interventions
  should address electronics, insulation, and building cross-contamination.
