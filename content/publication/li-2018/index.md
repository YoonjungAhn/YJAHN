abstract: Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Pollution Island (UPI) are two major problems
  of the urban environment and have become more serious with rapid urbanization. Since
  UHI and UPI can interact with each other, these two issues should be studied concurrently
  for a better urban environment. This study investigated the interaction between
  the UHI and UPI in Berlin, through a combined analysis of in-situ and remote sensing
  observations of aerosols and meteorological variables in June, July, and August
  from 2010 to 2017. The atmospheric UHI (AUHI), surface UHI (SUHI), atmospheric UPI
  (AUPI), and near-surface UPI (NSUPI) were analyzed. The SUHI and AUPI are represented
  by the remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) and aerosol optical depth (AOD),
  and the AUHI and NSUPI are represented by the in-situ air temperature and Particulate
  Matter (PM10) concentrations. The study area shows spatial consistency between SUHI
  and AUPI, with higher LST and AOD in the urban areas. UHI strengthens the turbulent
  dispersion of particles in the urban areas, decreasing the NSUPI. The NSUPI intensity
  shows a negative relationship with the AUHI intensity, especially at night with
  a correlation coefficient of âˆ’0.31. The increased aerosols in urban atmosphere reduce
  the incoming solar radiation and increase the atmospheric longwave radiation in
  the urban areas. The response of the surface to the change of absorbed radiation
  is strong at night and weak during the day. This study estimates that the SUHI intensity
  is enhanced by around 12% at clear night by the increased absorbed radiation in
  the urban areas using an attribution method. The goal of this paper is to strengthen
  the understanding of the interactive influence between UHI and UPI and provide a
  basis for designing mitigation strategies of UHI and UPI.
