abstract: 'Multi-Resolution Land Characterization 2000 (MRLC 2000) is a second-generation
  federal consortium to create an updated pool of nation-wide Landsat 7 imagery, and
  derive a second-generation National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2000). This multi-layer,
  multisource database will include a suite of 30-meter resolution data that will
  serve as standardized ingredients for the production of land cover â€“ both nationally
  and locally. This database will also provide the framework to allow flexibility
  in developing and applying suites of independent data layers. These nationally standardized
  independent data layers or components, will be useful not only within the land-cover
  classification but as data themes for other applications. This database will consist
  of the following components: (1) normalized tasseled cap (TC) transformations of
  Landsat 7 imagery for three time periods per scene (early, peak and late), (2) ancillary
  data layers, including 30m DEM derivatives of slope, aspect and elevation and three
  STATSCO soil derivatives, (4) image shape and texture information, (5) image derivatives
  of percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy per-pixel, (6) classified land-cover
  data derived from the Tassel Capped imagery, ancillary data and derivatives, (7)
  classification rules and metadata from the land cover classification, allowing future
  users the potential to modify rules to derive land cover products tailored to their
  specific local applications. In a pilot study application of the database concept,
  two mapping zones (Utah and Virginia) were selected for full generation of the above
  data components. Three derivative layers including, per-pixel imperviousness, per-pixel
  canopy and land cover were classified from the database. Cross validation accuracies
  for land cover ranged from 65-82%, and mean absolute error values of 10-15% were
  reported for percent tree canopy and imperviousness.'
