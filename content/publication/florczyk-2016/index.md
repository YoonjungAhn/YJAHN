abstract: An application of a general methodology for processing very high-resolution
  imagery to produce a European Settlement Map (ESM) in support of policy-makers is
  presented. The process mapped around 10 million km2 of the European continent. The
  input image data are satellite SPOT-5/6 pan-sharpened multispectral images of 2.5-
  and 1.5-m spatial resolution, respectively. This is the first time that remote sensing
  technology demonstrates capability to produce a continental information layer using
  2.5-m input images. Moreover, it is the highest resolution continental map produced
  so far. The presented workflow is data-driven and consists in fully automatic image
  information extraction based on textural and morphological image analysis. The learning
  method allows the processing of high-resolution image data using coarse resolution
  thematic layers as reference. Validation shows an overall accuracy of 96% with omission
  and commission errors less than 4% and 1%, respectively.
