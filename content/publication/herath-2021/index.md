abstract: Extreme urban heat, influenced by surface characteristics, negatively affects
  human thermal comfort. Understanding the thermal behaviour of different urban surface
  parameters (USPs) at large spatial scales is essential for strategic heat mitigation.
  This study evaluates USPs from several perspectives to assess their comparative
  effectiveness as heat mitigation strategies. The Air Pollution Model (TAPM) is used
  to simulate the urban climate of Melbourne for summer 2019 – Australia's warmest
  year. Fifty-two simulations are tested to represent changes in USPs as in vegetation
  type, built-cover ratio, building height, green roofs and cool roofs. The results
  of each simulation are compared with the baseline in terms of heat indices. Roofs
  with high albedos are found to be the best heat mitigation for reducing daytime
  temperatures (0.85 albedo; −1.29 °C) while green roofs show the best nighttime efficacy
  (100 %, −1.15 °C). Vegetation ratio, green and cool roofs show near-linear negative
  relationships with heat. Cooling is found to be more effective with trees when distributed
  in both canyon and urban parks than only planted in street canyon. These findings
  underscore the significance of USP characteristics in heat mitigation that can inform
  strategic urban planning with spatial arrangements of green infrastructure.
