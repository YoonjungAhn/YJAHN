abstract: <p>Deadly heat waves are increasing with climate change. Public forecasts
  and warnings are a primary public health strategy for dealing with such extreme
  weather events; however, temperatures can vary widely within the administrative
  units used to issue warnings, particularly across urban landscapes. The emergence
  of more frequent and widely distributed sources of urban temperature data provide
  the opportunity to investigate the specificity of the current National Weather Service
  (NWS) warnings and to improve their accuracy and precision. In this work, temperatures
  from distributed public weather stations, NWS heat advisories and warnings, and
  land surface temperature imagery throughout two large metropolitan areas, Atlanta
  and Chicago, during the 2006–2012 summers are considered. We investigate the spatial
  variability of hazardous temperatures and their agreement against NWS advisories.
  Second, we examine the potential for thermal imagery to replicate National Weather
  Service heat warnings. Observations from weather stations exhibit varying degrees
  of agreement with NWS advisories. The level of agreement varied by station and was
  not found to be associated with the station’s proximate land cover. Air temperatures
  estimated from satellite imagery correspond with NWS Advisory status regionally
  and may enable creating more refined public warnings regarding hazardous temperatures
  and protective actions</p>
