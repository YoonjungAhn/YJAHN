abstract: 'Rationale: Extremes of heat and particulate air pollution threaten human
  health and are becoming more frequent because of climate change. Understanding the
  health impacts of coexposure to extreme heat and air pollution is urgent. Objectives:
  To estimate the association of acute coexposure to extreme heat and ambient fine
  particulate matter (PM2.5) with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality
  in California from 2014 to 2019. Methods: We used a case-crossover study design
  with time-stratified matching using conditional logistic regression to estimate
  mortality associations with acute coexposures to extreme heat and PM2.5. For each
  case day (date of death) and its control days, daily average PM2.5 and maximum and
  minimum temperatures were assigned (0- to 3-day lag) on the basis of the decedent’s
  residence census tract. Measurements and Main Results: All-cause mortality risk
  increased 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1–8.1) on extreme maximum temperature-only
  days and 5.0% (95% CI, 3.0–8.0) on extreme PM2.5-only days, compared with nonextreme
  days. Risk increased by 21.0% (95% CI, 6.6–37.3) on days with exposure to both extreme
  maximum temperature and PM2.5. Increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory
  mortality on extreme coexposure days was 29.9% (95% CI, 3.3–63.3) and 38.0% (95%
  CI, 212.5 to 117.7), respectively, and were more than the sum of individual effects
  of extreme temperature and PM2.5 only. A similar pattern was observed for coexposure
  to extreme PM2.5 and minimum temperature. Effect estimates were larger over age
  75 years. Conclusions: Short-term exposure to extreme heat and air pollution alone
  were individually associated with increased risk of mortality, but their coexposure
  had larger effects beyond the sum of their individual effects.'
