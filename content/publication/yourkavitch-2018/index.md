abstract: 'One challenge to achieving Millennium Development Goals was inequitable
  access to quality health services. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development
  Goals, interventions need to reach underserved populations. Analyzing health indicators
  in small geographic units aids the identification of hotspots where coverage lags
  behind neighboring areas. The purpose of these analyses is to identify areas of
  low coverage or high need in order to inform effective resource allocation to reduce
  child health inequity between and within countries. Using data from The Demographic
  and Health Survey Program surveys conducted in 27 selected African countries between
  2010 and 2014, we computed estimates for six child health indicators for subnational
  regions. We calculated Global Moran’s I statistics and used Local Indicator of Spatial
  Association analysis to produce a spatial layer showing spatial associations. We
  created maps to visualize sub-national autocorrelation and spatial clusters. The
  Global Moran’s I statistic was positive for each indicator (range: 0.41 to 0.68),
  and statistically significant (p <0.05), suggesting spatial autocorrelation across
  national borders, and highlighting the need to examine health indicators both across
  countries and within them. Patterns of substantial differences among contiguous
  subareas were apparent; the average intra-country difference for each indicator
  exceeded 20 percentage points. Clusters of cross-border associations were also apparent,
  facilitating the identification of hotspots and informing the allocation of resources
  to reduce child health inequity between and within countries. This study exposes
  differences in health indicators in contiguous geographic areas, indicating that
  specific regional and subnational, in addition to national, strategies to improve
  health and reduce health inequalities are warranted.'
