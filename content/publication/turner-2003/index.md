abstract: 'Global environmental change and sustainability science increasingly recognize
  the need to address the consequences of changes taking place in the structure and
  function of the biosphere. These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are
  vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates
  that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses)
  alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing
  such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic
  design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human
  - environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect
  their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human-environment
  systems is presented.'
