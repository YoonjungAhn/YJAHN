abstract: <p>The objective of the study was to investigate, using academic-community
  epidemiologic co-analysis, the odds of reported heat-related illness for people
  with (1) central air conditioning (AC) or window unit AC versus no AC, and (2) fair/poor
  vs. good/excellent reported health. From 2016 to 2017, 101 Detroit residents were
  surveyed once regarding extreme heat, housing and neighborhood features, and heat-related
  illness in the prior 5 years. Academic partners selected initial confounders and,
  after instruction on directed acyclic graphs, community partners proposed alternate
  directed acyclic graphs with additional confounders. Heat-related illness was regressed
  on AC type or health and co-selected confounders. The study found that heat-related
  illness was associated with no-AC (n = 96, odds ratio (OR) = 4.66, 95% confidence
  interval (CI) = 1.22, 17.72); living ≤5 years in present home (n = 57, OR = 10.39,
  95% CI = 1.13, 95.88); and fair/poor vs. good/excellent health (n = 97, OR = 3.15,
  95% CI = 1.33, 7.48). Co-analysis suggested multiple built-environment confounders.
  We conclude that Detroit residents with poorer health and no AC are at greater risk
  during extreme heat. Academic-community co-analysis using directed acyclic graphs
  enhances research on community-specific social and health vulnerabilities by identifying
  key confounders and future research directions for rigorous and impactful research.</p>
