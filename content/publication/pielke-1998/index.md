abstract: Since the late 1980s, scientists and policy makers have devoted considerable
  attention and resources to the issue of global climate change. Domestic and international
  policies in response focus primarily on prevention of future climate impacts on
  society through the mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Academic and political
  attention is also largely focused on issues of mitigation. Adaptation refers to
  adjustments in individual, group, and institutional behavior in order to reduce
  society’s vulnerabilities to climate, and thus reduce its impacts. In 1996, the
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) wrote that adaptation offers a
  ‘very powerful option’ for responding to climate change and ought to be viewed as
  a ‘complement’ to mitigation efforts. Yet, the IPCC also wrote that ‘little attention
  has been paid to any possible tradeoff between both types of options’. This paper
  discusses the limitations of mitigation responses and the need for adaptation to
  occupy a larger role in climate policy.
