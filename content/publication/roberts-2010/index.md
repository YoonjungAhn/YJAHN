abstract: INTRODUCTION Marathon races faced with unexpectedly hot conditions must
  make a decision to start or not to start. The current race cancellation parameters
  may not reflect the safety profile of an individual race, and a universal temperature
  may not work an individual race. METHODS A retrospective review of the number of
  starters, finishers, and finish line medical encounters was used to calculate the
  rate of \"unsuccessful\" marathon starters from race records, where unsuccessful
  is defined as medical encounters seen for any reason in the finish medical area
  plus marathon starters who did not finish. Unsuccessful marathon starters were plotted
  against the race start wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and the WBGT level at
  which a mass casualty incident (MCI) occurred was used to calculate a \"do not start\"
  WBGT. RESULTS A start WBGT of >21 degrees C resulted in MCI or midrace cancellation
  in several races. Twin Cities Marathon data show a rapid increase in the rate of
  unsuccessful marathoner starters above a start WBGT of 13 degrees C. The event experienced
  an area-wide MCI at a start WBGT of 22 degrees C with an unsuccessful starter rate
  of 160 per 1000 finishers. CONCLUSIONS Marathons in northern latitudes (>40 degrees)
  held in \"unexpectedly\" hot conditions when the participants are not acclimatized
  and the start WBGT is >21 degrees C often end in either race cancellation or an
  MCI. It would seem prudent not to start these races in similar conditions. The rate
  of unsuccessful marathon starters per 1000 marathon finishers plotted against start
  WBGT generates a curve that can be used to estimate a do not start level. The do
  not start WBGT for Twin Cities Marathon is 20.5 degrees C on the basis of this model.
