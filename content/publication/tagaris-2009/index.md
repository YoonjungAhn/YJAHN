abstract: The potential health impact of ambient ozone and PM2.5 concentrations modulated
  by climate change over the United States is investigated using combined atmospheric
  and health modeling. Regional air quality modeling for 2001 and 2050 was conducted
  using CMAQ Modeling System with meteorology from the GISS Global Climate Model,
  downscaled regionally using MM5, keeping boundary conditions of air pollutants,
  emission sources, population, activity levels, and pollution controls constant.
  BenMap was employed to estimate the air pollution health outcomes at the county,
  state, and national level for 2050 caused by the effect of meteorology on future
  ozone and PM2.5 concentrations. The changes in calculated annual mean PM 2.5 concentrations
  show a relatively modest change with positive and negative responses (increasing
  PM2.5 levels across the northeastern U.S.) although average ozone levels slightly
  decrease across the northern sections of the U.S., and increase across the southern
  tier. Results suggest that climate change driven air quality-related health effects
  will be adversely affected in more than 2/3 of the continental U.S. Changes in health
  effects induced by PM2.5 dominate compared to those caused by ozone. PM 2.5-induced
  premature mortality is about 15 times higher than that due to ozone. Nationally
  the analysis suggests approximately 4000 additional annual premature deaths due
  to climate change impacts on PM2.5 vs 300 due to climate change-induced ozone changes.
  However, the impacts vary spatially. Increased premature mortality due to elevated
  ozone concentrations will be offset by lower mortality from reductions in PM2.5
  in 11 states. Uncertainties related to different emissions projections used to simulate
  future climate, and the uncertainties forecasting the meteorology, are large although
  there are potentially important unaddressed uncertainties (e.g., downscaling, speciation,
  interaction, exposure, and concentration-response function of the human health studies).
