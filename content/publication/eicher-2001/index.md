abstract: Dasymetric maps display statistical data in meaningful spatial zones. Such
  maps can be preferable to choropleth maps that show data by enumeration zones, because
  dasymetric zones more accurately represent underlying data distributions. Though
  dasymetric mapping has existed for well over a century, the methods for producing
  these maps have not been thoroughly examined. In contrast, research on areal interpolation
  has been more thorough and has examined methods of transferring data from one set
  of map zones to another, an issue that is applicable to dasymetric mapping. Inspired
  by this work, we tested five dasymetric mapping methods, including methods derived
  from work on areal interpolation. Dasymetric maps of six socio-economic variables
  were produced for a study area of 159 counties in the eastern U.S. using county
  choropleth data and ancillary land-use data. Both polygonal (vector) and grid (raster)
  dasymetric methods were tested. We evaluated map accuracy using both statistical
  analyses and visual presentations of error. A repeated-measures analysis of variance
  showed that the traditional limiting variable method had significantly lower error
  than the other four methods. In addition, polygon methods had lower error than their
  grid-based counterparts, though the difference was not statistically significant.
  Error maps largely supported the conclusions from the statistical analysis, while
  also presenting patterns of error that were not obvious from the statistics.
