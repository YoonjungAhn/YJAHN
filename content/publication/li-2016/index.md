abstract: The purpose of this study is to provide industry practitioners with a better
  understanding of the impacts of high-temperature conditions on construction labor
  productivity. Such information could assist in the establishment of plans to prevent
  heat-stress injuries and help improve the safety and comfort of construction labor
  working environments. On-site WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) data and labor productivity
  data related to direct work time, indirect work time and idle time were measured
  for two construction projects involving 16 rebar workers in the summer of 2014 in
  Beijing, China. The period from 14:00 to 15:00 was identified as the most hazardous
  for workers throughout the day, and the period from 07:00 to 09:00 was identified
  as the least hazardous time. Productivity models were further used to analyze the
  collected data. The model results demonstrated that high-temperature environments
  decrease labor productivity, with the percentage of direct work time decreasing
  by 0.57% and the percentage of idle time increasing by 0.74% when the WBGT increased
  by 1 °C. Moreover, the percentage of direct work time increased by 0.33% when the
  workers' experience increased by 1 year and decreased by 0.72% when the workers'
  age increased by 1 year. Overall, the results demonstrated that high-temperature
  environments impose heat stress on the human body and decreases labor productivity
  in the construction industry.
