abstract: Multi-temporal and spatially explicit population data are vital in many
  fields, such as demography, urban planning, disaster prevention, economics, and
  environmental modeling. Population data used in these studies are typically aggregated
  at census enumeration units, which are too coarse for many applications. Accurate
  population downscaling methods are needed to obtain population data at finer spatial
  resolutions. We use a novel settlement-related database, Built-Up Property Records
  (BUPR) from the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for the United States (HISDAC-US)
  to downscale population from census tracts to block groups. The BUPR dataset provides
  the number of built-up property records for each 250-m grid at 5-year temporal resolution
  from 1810 to 2015 for most contiguous United States (CONUS). The ability of BUPR
  to downscale population from census tracts to block groups for four states, representing
  a range of population densities, is evaluated here by comparing against other commonly-used
  ancillary datasets. The BUPR-based method outperforms all other methods in all but
  one state with highly-incomplete BUPR. A more detailed accuracy assessment is performed
  by dividing each state into low, medium, and high population density categories.
  The BUPR method produces more accurate downscaled population estimates for low and
  medium categories, though its performance deteriorates in the high density category
  due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution. BUPR-based dasymetric mapping is
  subsequently applied to the CONUS and found to generalize well beyond the four comparison
  states with high downscaling accuracy. The long-term record of the HISDAC-US dataset
  enables the potential construction of fine-grained population data back to 1810.
