abstract: 'Background: There have been large-scale outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth
  disease (HFMD) in Mainland China over the last decade. These events varied greatly
  across the country. It is necessary to identify the spatial risk factors and spatial
  distribution patterns of HFMD for public health control and prevention. Climate
  risk factors associated with HFMD occurrence have been recognized. However, few
  studies discussed the socio-economic determinants of HFMD risk at a space scale.
  Methods. HFMD records in Mainland China in May 2008 were collected. Both climate
  and socio-economic factors were selected as potential risk exposures of HFMD. Odds
  ratio (OR) was used to identify the spatial risk factors. A spatial autologistic
  regression model was employed to get OR values of each exposures and model the spatial
  distribution patterns of HFMD risk. Results: Results showed that both climate and
  socio-economic variables were spatial risk factors for HFMD transmission in Mainland
  China. The statistically significant risk factors are monthly average precipitation
  (OR = 1.4354), monthly average temperature (OR = 1.379), monthly average wind speed
  (OR = 1.186), the number of industrial enterprises above designated size (OR = 17.699),
  the population density (OR = 1.953), and the proportion of student population (OR
  = 1.286). The spatial autologistic regression model has a good goodness of fit (ROC
  = 0.817) and prediction accuracy (Correct ratio = 78.45%) of HFMD occurrence. The
  autologistic regression model also reduces the contribution of the residual term
  in the ordinary logistic regression model significantly, from 17.25 to 1.25 for
  the odds ratio. Based on the prediction results of the spatial model, we obtained
  a map of the probability of HFMD occurrence that shows the spatial distribution
  pattern and local epidemic risk over Mainland China. Conclusions: The autologistic
  regression model was used to identify spatial risk factors and model spatial risk
  patterns of HFMD. HFMD occurrences were found to be spatially heterogeneous over
  the Mainland China, which is related to both the climate and socio-economic variables.
  The combination of socio-economic and climate exposures can explain the HFMD occurrences
  more comprehensively and objectively than those with only climate exposures. The
  modeled probability of HFMD occurrence at the county level reveals not only the
  spatial trends, but also the local details of epidemic risk, even in the regions
  where there were no HFMD case records. Â© 2014 Bo et al.; licensee BioMed Central
