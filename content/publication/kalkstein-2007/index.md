abstract: Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States. Although
  previous research suggests that social influences affect human responses to natural
  disaster warnings, no studies have examined the social impacts of heat or heat warnings
  on a population. Here, 201 surveys were distributed in Metropolitan Phoenix to determine
  the social impacts of the heat warning system, or more specifically, to gauge risk
  perception and warning response. Consistent with previous research, increased risk
  perception of heat results in increased response to a warning. Different social
  factors such as sex, race, age, and income all play an important role in determining
  whether or not people will respond to a warning. In particular, there is a strong
  sense of perceived risk to the heat among Hispanics which translates to increased
  response when heat warnings are issued. Based on these findings, suggestions are
  presented to help improve the Phoenix Heat Warning System. Â© 2007 ISB.
