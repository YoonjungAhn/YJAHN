abstract: There is little consensus about the meaning of the terms \"health disparities,\"
  \"health inequalities,\" or \"health equity.\" The definitions can have important
  practical consequences, determining the measurements that are monitored by governments
  and international agencies and the activities that will be supported by resources
  earmarked to address health disparities/inequalities or health equity. This paper
  aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably
  here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for
  measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not
  refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular
  type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that
  could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged
  social groups-such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups
  who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination-systematically
  experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups.
  (\"Social advantage\" refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined
  by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences
  between the most advantaged group in a given category-e.g., the wealthiest, the
  most powerful racial/ethnic group-and all others, not only between the best- and
  worst-off groups. Pursuing health equity means pursuing the elimination of such
  health disparities/inequalities. Copyright Â© 2006 by Annual Reviews. All rights
