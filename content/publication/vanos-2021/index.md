abstract: Thermal comfort research has utilized various sensors and models to estimate
  the mean radiant temperature (MRT) experienced by a human, including the standard
  black globe thermometer (SGT), acrylic globe thermometers (AGT), and cylindrical
  radiation thermometers (CRT). Rather than directly measuring radiation, a temperature
  is measured in the center of these low-cost sensors that can be related to MRT after
  theoretically accounting for convection. However, these sensors have not been systematically
  tested under long-term hot and clear conditions. Further, under variable weather
  conditions, many issues can arise due to slow response times, shape, inaccuracies
  in material properties and assumptions, and color (albedo, emissivity) inconsistencies.
  Here, we assess the performance of MRT produced by various heat transfer models,
  with and without new average surface temperature (T¯ s) correction factors, using
  five instruments—the SGT (15 cm, black), tan and black CRTs, gray and black 38 mm
  AGTs—compared to 3D integral radiation measurements. Measurements were taken on
  an unobscured roof throughout summer-to-early-fall months in Tempe, Arizona, examining
  58 full-sun days. Deviations without correcting for asymmetrical surface heating—found
  to be the main cause of errors—reached ± 15–20 °C MRT. By accounting for asymmetric
  heating through T¯ s calculations, new corrective algorithms were derived for the
  low-cost sensor models. Results show significant improvements in the estimated MRT
  error for each sensor (i.e., ∆MRTmodel − IRM) when applying the T¯ s corrections.
  The tan MRTCRT improved from 1.9 ± 6.2 to −0.1 ± 4.4 °C, while the gray AGT and
  SGT showed improvements from −1.6 ± 7.2 to −0.4 ± 6.3 °C and − 6.6 ± 6.4 to − 0.03
  ± 5.7 °C, respectively. The new corrections also eliminated dependence on other
  meteorological factors (zenith, wind speed). From these results, we provide three
  simple equations for CRT, AGT, and SGT correction for future research use under
  warm-hot and clear conditions. This study is the most comprehensive empirical assessment
  of various low-cost instruments with broad applicability in urban climate and biometeorological
  research.
