abstract: 'With the development of information and communications technology, user-generated
  content and crowdsourced data are playing a large role in studies of transport and
  public health. Recently, Strava, a popular website and mobile app dedicated to tracking
  athletic activity (cycling and running), began offering a data service called Strava
  Metro, designed to help transportation researchers and urban planners to improve
  infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. Strava Metro data has the potential
  to promote studies of cycling and health by indicating where commuting and non-commuting
  cycling activities are at a large spatial scale (street level and intersection level).
  The assessment of spatially varying effects of air pollution during active travel
  (cycling or walking) might benefit from Strava Metro data, as a variation in air
  pollution levels within a city would be expected. In this paper, to explore the
  potential of Strava Metro data in research of active travel and health, we investigate
  spatial patterns of non-commuting cycling activities and associations between cycling
  purpose (commuting and non-commuting) and air pollution exposure at a large scale.
  Additionally, we attempt to estimate the number of non-commuting cycling trips according
  to environmental characteristics that may help identify cycling behavior. Researchers
  who are undertaking studies relating to cycling purpose could benefit from this
  approach in their use of cycling trip data sets that lack trip purpose. We use the
  Strava Metro Nodes data from Glasgow, United Kingdom in an empirical study. Empirical
  results reveal some findings that (1) when compared with commuting cycling activities,
  non-commuting cycling activities are more likely to be located in outskirts of the
  city; (2) spatially speaking, cyclists riding for recreation and other purposes
  are more likely to be exposed to relatively low levels of air pollution than cyclists
  riding for commuting; and (3) the method for estimating of the number of non-commuting
  cycling activities works well in this study. The results highlight: (1) a need for
  policymakers to consider how to improve cycling infrastructure and road safety in
  outskirts of cities; and (2) a possible way of estimating the number of non-commuting
  cycling activities when the trip purpose of cycling data is unknown.'
