abstract: In this study we considered confounding from air pollutants and chronological
  variables in the relation between humidex, a summer temperature and humidity index,
  and nonaccidental mortality, from 1980-1996 in Toronto, Canada. Changes in the risk
  of death by age group, gender, and combined cardiac-respiratory cause of death were
  estimated for both 1°C and 50-95th percentile increases in humidex using a generalized
  additive linear model. With air pollution terms in the models, relative risk (RR)
  point estimates narrowly exceeded 1.0 for all groups. Humidex effects were most
  apparent for females (RR=1.006, 95% CI=1.004-1.008 per 1°C humidex and RR=1.089,
  95% CI=1.058-1.121 for 50th to 95th percentile humidex). When air pollution was
  omitted from the model, RR in the 50-95th percentile analysis increased less than
  1.71% for all groups except females, for which RR decreased 1.42%. Differences in
  RR per 1°C humidex were all less than 0.12%. Confidence intervals narrowed slightly
  for all groups investigated. Heat stress has a statistically significant, yet minimal
  impact on Toronto populations, and air pollution does appear to have a small, but
  consistent confounding effect on humidex effect estimates. © 2003 Elsevier Science
