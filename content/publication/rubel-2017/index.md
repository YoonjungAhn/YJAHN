abstract: Although the European Alps are one of the most investigated regions worldwide,
  maps depicting climate change by means of climate classification are still not-existent.
  To contribute to this topic, a time series of very high resolution (30 arc-seconds)
  maps of the well-known Köppen-Geiger climate classification is presented. The maps
  cover the greater Alpine region located within the geographical domain of 4 to 19
  degrees longitude and 43 to 49 degrees latitude. Gridded monthly data were selected
  to compile climate maps within this region. Observations for the period 1800–2010
  were taken from the historical instrumental climatological surface time series of
  the greater Alpine region, HISTALP. Projected climate data for the period 2011–2100
  were taken, as an example, from the Rossby Centre regional atmospheric model RCA4.
  Temperature fields were spatially disaggregated by applying the observed seasonal
  cycle of the environmental lapse rate. The main results of this study are, therefore,
  366 observed and predicted (two scenarios) very high resolution Köppen-Geiger climate
  maps of the greater Alpine region covering the period 1800–2100. Digital data, as
  well as animated maps, showing the shift of the climate zones are provided on the
  following website http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at. Furthermore, the relationship
  between the Köppen-Geiger climate classification and the altitudinal belts of the
  Alps is demonstrated by calculating the boundaries of the climate zones, i.e. the
  deciduous forest line, the mixed forest line, the forest and tree line (timber line)
  and the snow line. The mean altitude of the potential timber line in the greater
  Alpine region, for example, was calculated to be 1730 m by the end of the 19th century,
  1880 m by the end of the 20th century and to lie between 2120 and 2820 m by the
  end of the 21st century. The latter altitudes were projected for the greenhouse
  gas scenarios RCP 2.6 (best case) and RCP 8.5 (worst case). The altitude of the
  timber line (and the other boundaries of the altitudinal belts) is generally higher
  in the Western Alps, showing a clear west-east slope.
