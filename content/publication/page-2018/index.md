abstract: Wildland fire managers in the United States currently utilize the gridded
  forecasts from the National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) to make fire behavior
  predictions across complex landscapes during large wildfires. However, little is
  known about the NDFDs performance in remote locations with complex topography for
  weather variables important for fire behavior prediction, including air temperature,
  relative humidity, and wind speed. In this study NDFD forecasts for calendar year
  2015 were evaluated in fire-prone locations across the conterminous United States
  during periods with the potential for active fire spread using the model performance
  statistics of root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean fractional bias (MFB), and mean
  bias error (MBE). Results indicated that NDFD forecasts of air temperature and relative
  humidity performed well with RMSEs of about 28C and 10%-11%, respectively. However,
  wind speed was increasingly under-predicted when observed wind speeds exceeded about
  4 m s 21 , with MFB and MBE values of approximately 215% and 20.5 m s 21 , respectively.
  The importance of accurate wind speed forecasts in terms of fire behavior prediction
  was confirmed, and the forecast accuracies needed to achieve ''good'' surface head
  fire rate-of-spread predictions were estimated as 620%-30% of the observed wind
  speed. Weather station location, the specific forecast office, and terrain complexity
  had the largest impacts on wind speed forecast error, although the relatively low
  variance explained by the model (;37%) suggests that other variables are likely
  to be important. Based on these results it is suggested that wildland fire managers
  should use caution when utilizing the NDFD wind speed forecasts if high wind speed
  events are anticipated.
