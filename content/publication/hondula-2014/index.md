abstract: This year marks the tenth anniversary of the development of the revised
  Spatial Synoptic Classification, the \"SSC\", by Scott Sheridan. This daily weather-type
  classification scheme has become one of the key analytical tools implemented in
  a diverse range of climatological investigations, including analysis of air quality
  variability, human health, vegetation growth, precipitation and snowfall trends,
  and broader analyses of historical and future climatic variability and trends. The
  continued and expanding use of the SSC motivates a review and comparison of the
  system's research and geographic foci to date, with the goal of identifying promising
  areas for future efforts, particularly within the context of human health and climate
  change. This review also assesses how the SSC has complemented and compares with
  other current environmental epidemiological studies in weather and health. Â© 2013
