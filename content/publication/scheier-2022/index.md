abstract: Energy inequity is an issue of increasing urgency. Few policy-relevant datasets
  evaluate the energy burden of typical American households. Here, we develop a framework
  using Net Energy Analysis and household socioeconomic data to measure systematic
  energy inequity among critical groups that need policy attention. We find substantial
  instances of energy poverty in the United States â€“ 16% of households experience
  energy poverty as presently defined as spending more than 6% of household income
  on energy expenditures. More than 5.2 million households above the Federal Poverty
  Line face energy poverty, disproportionately burdening Black, Hispanic, and Native
  American communities. For solar, wind, and energy efficiency to address socioeconomic
  mobility, programs must reduce energy expenditures by expanding eligibility requirements
  for support and access to improved conservation measures, efficiency upgrades, and
  distributed renewables. We recommend the United States develop a more inclusive
  federal energy poverty categorization that increases assistance for household energy
  costs. Net energy metrics reveal disparities in United States household energy burdens.
  Here the authors find that at least five million households are excluded from current
  accounting methods, with race, education, and housing tenure accounting for large
  differences in energy burden.
