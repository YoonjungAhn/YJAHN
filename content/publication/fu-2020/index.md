abstract: Global warming is inevitably the cause of local climate change, which will
  have a profound impact on regional ecology, especially in the desertified steppe
  and steppefied desert transition zones with fragile ecological environments. In
  order to investigate the change trends of precipitation, temperature and wind speed
  for effectively realizing the restoration and protection of desert ecosystems, a
  combination forecasting strategy including the data pre-processing technique, sub-models
  selection and parameter optimization was proposed and three numerical simulation
  experiments based on the combination model with the weights optimized by the particle
  swarm optimization algorithm were designed to forecast the precipitation, temperature
  and wind speed in the southeastern margin of the Tengger Desert in China. Numerical
  results showed that the proposed combination prediction method has higher forecasting
  accuracy and better robustness than single neural network models and hybrid models.
  The proposed method is beneficial to analyze climate change in arid regions.
