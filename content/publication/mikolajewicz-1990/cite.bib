 abstract = {Changes in surface air temperature resulting from a doubling in atmospheric carbon dioxide drive changes in ocean circulation. Results from an ocean general circulation model project a global mean sea level rise from thermal expansion alone to be 19cm in 50 years. Regional values, however, can vary: a rise of 40cm is projected in the North Atlantic (owing to reduction of deep-water formation), whereas the level of the Ross Sea actually falls through changes in ocean circulation.
