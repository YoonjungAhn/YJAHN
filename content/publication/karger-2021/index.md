abstract: High-resolution climatic data are essential to many questions and applications
  in environmental research and ecology. Here we develop and implement a new semi-mechanistic
  downscaling approach for daily precipitation estimate that incorporates high resolution
  (30 arcsec, â‰ˆ1 km) satellite-derived cloud frequency. The downscaling algorithm
  incorporates orographic predictors such as wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary
  layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. We apply the method to the ERA5
  precipitation archive and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily
  gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward.
  Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from
  the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal
  performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny
  of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates
  that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in comparison to other precipitation products.
  The CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared
  with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.
