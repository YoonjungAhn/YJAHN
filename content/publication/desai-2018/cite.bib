 abstract = {The present research aimed at analyzing temporal trends in thermal
discomfort indices for a period of 46 years from 1969 to 2014 over
western coastal region of India for seven urban centers during the
months of pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Direct thermal discomfort
indices employed for this purpose were thermo-hygrometric index (THI)
and heat index (HI). Statistical techniques applied for obtaining
temporal trends were linear regression model and Mann-Kendall (MK) rank
test. Statistical significance of the obtained trends was evaluated at
95% confidence level. Sequential MK (SQ-MK) test was used for change
point detection. To investigate actual incidences of thermal discomfort,
daily index values were averaged for standard meteorological weeks
(SMWs) over the study period and decadal percentage of thermal
discomfort during SMWs was estimated. Trend analysis of selected
meteorological parameters such as dry bulb temperature (DBT), wet bulb
temperature (WBT), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS) were
investigated, which might be responsible for variation in thermal
discomfort over the period. The results obtained depicted significant
increase in thermal discomfort over the cities located on the southern
part of west coast, while significant increase was observed during
monsoon season months compared to pre-monsoon season. Decadal variation
in percentage of SMWs falling in various discomfort categories was
studied. At majority of the stations, moderate and high-risk SMWs have
increased over the last two decades. The results of change point
detection for THI and HI denoted significant increase at most of the
stations after 1990s. The study validates increase in thermal discomfort
vulnerability, particularly at thriving urban centers of western coastal
region of India.},
