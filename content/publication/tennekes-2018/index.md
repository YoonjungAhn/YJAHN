abstract: Thematic maps show spatial distributions. The theme refers to the phenomena
  that is shown, which is often demographical, social, cultural, or economic. The
  best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according
  to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting
  system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic
  maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one
  or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps
  can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes,
  such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics
  device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R
  package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing
  spatial data.
