abstract: As the physical consequences of accidental falls in the elderly are well-researched,
  the long-term associations between falls and quality of life and related concepts
  are less known. The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the long-term
  relations between falls and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life satisfaction
  (LS) over six years in the general elderly population.One thousand three hundred
  and twenty-one subjects (aged 60-93 years), from the general population in the south
  of Sweden, were included in a baseline assessment and a follow-up after six years.
  HRQoL was measured with the SF-12 and LS with the life satisfaction index A (LSI-A).
  The differences in mean scores between fallers at baseline (n= 113) and non-fallers
  were statistical analyzed. Furthermore, the prediction of falls on the outcomes
  was analyzed using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for multiple
  confounding factors.Fallers scored significant lower in HRQoL and LS at baseline
  and after six years, compared to non-fallers, especially in the SF-12 physical component
  (p= <0.001). In the linear regression analysis, one or more falls at the baseline
  predicted a significant reduction in the SF-12 physical component at the follow-up
  assessment (B-Coefficient -1.8, 95% CI -3.4 to -0.2). In conclusion, falls predict
  a long-term reduction in the physical component of HRQoL in the general elderly
  population. Over six years, fallers had a notable chronic lowered score in both
  HRQoL and LS, compared to non-fallers. This long-term depression of elderly fallers
  in these aspects may be more extent than previous assumed. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland
