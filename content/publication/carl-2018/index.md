abstract: spind is an R package aiming to provide a useful toolkit to account for
  spatial dependence in the analysis of lattice data. Grid-based data sets in spatial
  modelling often exhibit spatial dependence, i.e. values sampled at nearby locations
  are more similar than those sampled further apart. spind methods, described here,
  take this kind of two-dimensional dependence into account and are sensitive to its
  variation across different spatial scales. Methods presented to account for spatial
  autocorrelation are based on the two fundamentally different approaches of generalised
  estimating equations as well as waveletrevised methods. Both methods are extensions
  to generalised linear models. spind also provides functions for multi-model inference
  and scaling by wavelet multiresolution regression. Since model evaluation is essential
  for assessing prediction accuracy in species distribution modelling, spind additionally
  supplies users with spatial accuracy measures, i.e. measures that are sensitive
  to the spatial arrangement of the predictions.
