abstract: The ever accelerating process of globalization enables more than half the
  population to live in cities. Thus, the air quality in cities exerts critical influence
  on the health status of more and more urban residents. In this article, based on
  urban air quality data collected through meteorological sites, mobile crowdsourcing,
  and IoT sensing, along with users' body signals, we propose an urban healthcare
  big data system named UH-BigDataSys. In this article, we first introduce a method
  of integrating multi-source air quality data for the data preparation of artificial-intelligence-based
  smart urban services. Then a testbed of UH-BigDataSys is set up with the deployment
  of air-quality-Aware healthcare applications. Finally, we provide health guidance
  for urban residents in aspects of respiratory diseases, outdoor travel, sleep quality,
  and so on. The ultimate goal of UH-BigDataSys is for urban residents to lead healthier
  lives.
