abstract: 'Household water insecurity is a global threat to human health and development,
  yet existing metrics lack a systematic consideration of geographic inequality and
  spatial variation. In this article, we introduce the notion of plumbing poverty
  as a conceptual and methodological heuristic to examine the intersectional nature
  of infrastructure, space, and social inequality. Plumbing poverty is understood
  in a dual sense: first, as a material and infrastructural condition produced by
  social relations that fundamentally vary through space and, second, as a methodology
  that operationalizes the spatial exploration of social inequality. Drawing on millions
  of census records, we strip household water security down to a single vital measure—the
  presence of complete household plumbing—to assess its spatial and sociodemographic
  trends. We identify distinct hot spots (geographic clusters of higher than average
  values) of plumbing poverty, track its social and spatial variance, and expose its
  fundamentally racialized nature. Our study finds that plumbing poverty is neither
  spatially nor socially random in the United States. Rather, plumbing incompleteness
  is spatially clustered in certain regions of the country and is clearly racialized:
  Living in an American Indian or Alaskan Native, black, or Hispanic household increases
  the odds of being plumbing poor, and these predictors warp and woof through space.
  In considering who experiences the slow violence of infrastructural dysfunction,
  a geography that is simultaneously ignored and unevenly expressed in the United
  States, we argue that analyses of space and social difference are central to understanding
  household water insecurity and must be prioritized in the development of cross-comparable
  metrics and global measurement tools. Key Words: census microdata, hot spot analysis,
  household water insecurity, infrastructural geographies, IPUMS.'
