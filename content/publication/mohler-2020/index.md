abstract: Governments have implemented social distancing measures to address the ongoing
  COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include instructions that individuals maintain social
  distance when in public, school closures, limitations on gatherings and business
  operations, and instructions to remain at home. Social distancing may have an impact
  on the volume and distribution of crime. Crimes such as residential burglary may
  decrease as a byproduct of increased guardianship over personal space and property.
  Crimes such as domestic violence may increase because of extended periods of contact
  between potential offenders and victims. Understanding the impact of social distancing
  on crime is critical for ensuring the safety of police and government capacity to
  deal with the evolving crisis. Understanding how social distancing policies impact
  crime may also provide insights into whether people are complying with public health
  measures. Examination of the most recently available data from both Los Angeles,
  CA, and Indianapolis, IN, shows that social distancing has had a statistically significant
  impact on a few specific crime types. However, the overall effect is notably less
  than might be expected given the scale of the disruption to social and economic
  life.
