abstract: With its audacious goal to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries,
  Vision Zero represents the opportunity to rethink how we utilize data, invest resources,
  and operate today's transportation system to improve conditions so that all road
  users, including pedestrians and bicyclists, have the opportunity to travel safely.
  In the US context, \"getting to zero\" requires an explicit focus on health equity
  involving data collection, community engagement, and public investments in low-income
  communities, communities of color, and among road users most disproportionately
  involved in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. Motor vehicle safety measures
  implemented throughout the 20 th century-like improved vehicle and roadway design,
  broader use of safety belts and car seats, and stronger drunk driving laws and enforcement-have
  contributed to substantial reductions in traffic-related death rates in the United
  States, even as annual vehicle miles traveled increased steadily during the same
  time period. 1 Despite this progress, traffic collisions remain a leading cause
  of death and disability in the US and are responsible for more deaths among children
  and young adults than any other cause. 2,3 Motor vehicle crashes resulted in more
  than 35,000 deaths-approximately 96 deaths per day-in 2014, and two million non-fatal
  injuries in 2013. 4,5 The US motor vehicle crash death rate of 10.3 deaths per 100,000
  people far outstripped such deaths in peer nations in 2013. 6 Motor vehicle crashes
  are also extremely costly in the US with fatalities totaling $44 billion in medical
  and work loss costs in 2013 and injuries totaling $18 billion in lifetime medical
  costs and another $33 billion in lifetime work loss costs in 2012. 7,8 Injuries
  are not accidents-they are predictable and preventable. As the 20 th century experience
  demonstrates, employing comprehensive, integrated, and quality prevention strategies
  saves and improves lives and reduces healthcare, law enforcement, and other governmental
  and business costs to society. Today, nearly two decades into the 21 st century,
  promising traffic safety policies, programs, and initiatives are emerging. These
  include active transportation investments, Complete Streets policies, Safe Routes
  to School programs, and-the particular focus of this brief-Vision Zero initiatives.
  Vision Zero is a growing movement in cities across the US and around the globe to
  eliminate all traffic-related deaths and severe injuries within a designated time
  period. Distinct in its acknowledgement that traffic-related deaths and severe injuries
  are preventable, and its focus on improving traffic safety through systems-level
  approaches, Vision Zero strives for better transportation systems and infrastructure
  for vehicle traffic as well as for people who walk, ride bicycles, and use other
  forms of transportation. Vision Zero is a bold vision that is not only possible,
  but necessary. First implemented in Sweden in 1997, then successfully across Europe
  and other parts of the world, Vision Zero is now actively being implemented in over
  two dozen US cities from Anchorage, Alaska, to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 9 Compared
  to other countries, there are major differences in travel behaviors,
