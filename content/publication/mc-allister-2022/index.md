abstract: 'Extreme heat is annually the deadliest weather hazard in the United States
  and is strongly amplified by climate change. In Florida, summer heat waves have
  increased in frequency and duration, exacerbating negative human health impacts
  on a state with a substantial older population and industries (e.g., agriculture)
  that require frequent outdoor work. However, the combined impacts of temperature
  and humidity (heat stress) have not been previously investigated. For eight Florida
  cities, this study constructs summer climatologies and trend analyses (1950–2020)
  of two heat stress metrics: heat index (HI) and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
  While both incorporate temperature and humidity, WBGT also includes wind and solar
  radiation and is a more comprehensive measure of heat stress on the human body.
  With minor exceptions, results show increases in average summer daily maximum, mean,
  and minimum HI and WBGT throughout Florida. Daily minimum HI and WBGT exhibit statistically
  significant increases at all eight stations, emphasizing a hazardous rise in nighttime
  heat stress. Corresponding to other recent studies, HI and WBGT increases are largest
  in coastal subtropical locations in central and southern Florida (i.e., Daytona
  Beach, Tampa, Miami, and Key West) but exhibit no conclusive relationship with urbanization
  changes. Danger (1038–1248F; 39.48–51.18C) HI and high (.888F; 31.18C) WBGT summer
  days exhibit significant frequency increases across the state. Especially at coastal
  locations in the Florida Peninsula and Keys, danger HI and high WBGT days now account
  for .20% of total summer days, emphasizing a substantial escalation in heat stress,
  particularly since 2000.'
