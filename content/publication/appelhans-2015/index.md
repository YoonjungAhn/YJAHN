abstract: Spatially high resolution climate information is required for a variety
  of applications in but not limited to functional biodiversity research. In order
  to scale the generally plot-based research findings to a landscape level, spatial
  interpolation methods of meteorological variables are required. Based on a network
  of temperature observation plots across the southern slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro,
  the skill of 14 machine learning algorithms in predicting spatial temperature patterns
  is tested and evaluated against the heavily utilized kriging approach. Based on
  a 10-fold cross-validation testing design, regression trees generally perform better
  than linear and non-linear regression models. The best individual performance has
  been observed by the stochastic gradient boosting model followed by Cubist, random
  forest and model averaged neural networks which except for the latter are all regression
  tree-based algorithms. While these machine learning algorithms perform better than
  kriging in a quantitative evaluation, the overall visual interpretation of the resulting
  air temperature maps is ambiguous. Here, a combined Cubist and residual kriging
  approach can be considered the best solution.
