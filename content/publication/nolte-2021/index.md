abstract: Access to rich, nationwide property data has catalyzed rapid empirical work
  concerning land use choices in several fields of inquiry, including environmental
  economics, urban geography, and conservation biology. When data on property transactions
  and assessments are provided in its original or only partially pre-processed state,
  the accuracy, reliability, and generalizability of findings can be improved with
  a series of cleaning procedures and quality checks. We discuss issues inherent in
  using increasingly popular, nationwide data to perform econometric analyses and
  propose best practices for data preparation by example of ZTRAX, a U.S.-wide real
  estate database available to academics, non-profit, and government researchers between
  2016 and 2023. We cover (1) the identification of arms-length sales, (2) the geo-location
  of parcels and buildings, (3) temporal linkages between transaction, assessor, and
  parcel data, (4) the identification of property types, such as single-family homes
  and vacant lands, and (5) dealing with missing or mismeasured data for standard
  housing attributes. We provide supplementary maps, filtering tables, and algorithmic
  descriptions to help analysts check and document their choices, improve the quality
  of ongoing and planned research, and help readers better understand the scope, reliability,
  and generalizability of findings and data products.
