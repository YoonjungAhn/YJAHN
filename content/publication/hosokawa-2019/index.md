abstract: Exertional heat illness (EHI) risk is a serious concern among athletes,
  laborers, and warfighters. US Governing organizations have established various activity
  modification guidelines (AMGs) and other risk mitigation plans to help ensure the
  health and safety of their workers. The extent of metabolic heat production and
  heat gain that ensue from their work are the core reasons for EHI in the aforementioned
  population. Therefore, the major focus of AMGs in all settings is to modulate the
  work intensity and duration with additional modification in adjustable extrinsic
  risk factors (e.g., clothing, equipment) and intrinsic risk factors (e.g., heat
  acclimatization, fitness, hydration status). Future studies should continue to integrate
  more physiological (e.g., valid body fluid balance, internal body temperature) and
  biometeorological factors (e.g., cumulative heat stress) to the existing heat risk
  assessment models to reduce the assumptions and limitations in them. Future interagency
  collaboration to advance heat mitiga-tion plans among physically active population
  is desired to maximize the existing resources and data to facilitate advancement
  in AMGs for environmental heat.
