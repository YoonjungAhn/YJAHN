abstract: 'It is well known that exposure to thermal stress during pregnancy can lead
  to an increased incidence of premature births. However, there is little known regarding
  window(s) of susceptibility during the course of a pregnancy. We attempted to identify
  possible windows of susceptibility in a cohort study of 3604 children in Changsha
  with a hot-summer and cold winter climatic characteristics. We examined the association
  between PTB and ambient temperature during different timing windows of pregnancy:
  conception month, three trimesters, birth month and entire pregnancy. We found a
  U-shaped relation between the prevalence of PTB and mean ambient temperature during
  pregnancy. Both high and low temperatures were associated with PTB risk, adjusted
  OR (95% CI) respectively 2.57 (1.98–3.33) and 2.39 (1.93–2.95) for 0.5 °C increase
  in high temperature range (>18.2°C) and 0.5°C decrease in low temperature range
  (< 18.2°C). Specifically, PTB was significantly associated with ambient temperature
  and extreme heat/cold days during conception month and the third trimester. Sensitivity
  analysis indicated that female fetus were more susceptible to the risk of ambient
  temperature. Our study indicates that the risk of preterm birth due to high or low
  temperature may exist early during the conception month.'
