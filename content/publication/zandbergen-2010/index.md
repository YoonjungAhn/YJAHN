abstract: 'Dasymetric mapping techniques can be employed to estimate population characteristics
  of small areas that do not correspond to census enumeration areas. Land cover has
  been the most widely used source of ancillary data in dasymetric mapping. The current
  research examines the performance of alternative sources of ancillary data, including
  imperviousness, road networks, and nighttime lights. Nationally available datasets
  were used in the analysis to allow for replicability. The performance of the techniques
  used to examine these sources was compared to areal weighting and traditional land
  cover techniques. Four states were used in the analysis, representing a range of
  different geographic regions: Connecticut, New Mexico, Oregon, and South Carolina.
  Ancillary data sources were used to estimate census block group population counts
  using census tracts as source zones, and the results were compared to the known
  block group population counts. Results indicate that the performance of dasymetric
  methods varies substantially among study areas, and no single technique consistently
  outperforms all others. The three best techniques are imperviousness with values
  greater than 75 percent removed, imperviousness with values greater than 60 percent
  removed, and land cover. Total imperviousness and roads perform slightly worse,
  with nighttime lights performing the worst compared to all other ancillary data
  types. All techniques performed better than areal weighting.'
