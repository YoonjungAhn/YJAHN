 abstract = {\ This book is a revised and updated version of a collection of presentations given by a group of distinguished researchers in the field of Geographic Information Science who gathered in Manchester in July 2001 and contains a collection of essays and discussions on this theme. It delves into subjects such as the nature of geographic information, the fundamental principles associated with it, how geographic information can be quantified, and how it can be communicated and related to the other information sciences. Foundations of Geographic Information Science should be useful for graduate students, researchers, and high-level professionals. \},
