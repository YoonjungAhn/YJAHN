abstract: ' This book is a revised and updated version of a collection of presentations
  given by a group of distinguished researchers in the field of Geographic Information
  Science who gathered in Manchester in July 2001 and contains a collection of essays
  and discussions on this theme. It delves into subjects such as the nature of geographic
  information, the fundamental principles associated with it, how geographic information
  can be quantified, and how it can be communicated and related to the other information
  sciences. Foundations of Geographic Information Science should be useful for graduate
  students, researchers, and high-level professionals. '
