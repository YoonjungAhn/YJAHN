abstract: 'Aging exacerbates hyperthermia and cardiovascular strain during passive
  heat exposure, but it remains unclear whether those effects worsen in older adults
  with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined these responses in unacclimatized, physically
  active, older individuals with (n = 13, mean ± SD age: 60 ± 8 years, HbA1c: 7.0
  ± 1.0%) and without (Control, n = 30, 62 ± 6 years) well-controlled T2D during a
  brief, 3-h passive exposure to extreme heat (44°C, 30% relative humidity). Metabolic
  heat production, dry heat gain, total heat gain (metabolic heat production + dry
  heat gain), evaporative heat loss, body heat storage (summation of heat gain/loss),
  rectal and mean skin temperatures as well as heart rate were measured continuously.
  No between-group differences were observed for metabolic heat production (T2D vs.
  Control; 53 ± 5 vs. 55 ± 7 W/m2), dry heat gain (48 ± 9 vs. 47 ± 11 W/m2), total
  heat gain (101 ± 10 vs. 102 ± 14 W/m2) and evaporative heat loss (83 ± 10 vs. 85
  ± 12 W/m2) over the 3 h (all P > 0.05). Consequently, the changes in body heat storage
  (380 ± 93 vs. 358 ± 172 kJ, P = 0.67) were similar between groups. Moreover, no
  between-group differences in rectal and mean skin temperatures or heart rate were
  measured. We conclude that unacclimatized, physically active, older adults with
  well-controlled T2D do not experience greater hyperthermia and cardiovascular strain
  compared to their healthy counterparts while resting in extreme heat for a brief,
  3-h period.'
