abstract: A detailed model of Alpine surface processes is used to simulate the amount
  of preferential deposition as well as redistribution of snow due to snowdrift for
  two alpine glaciers (Goldbergkees and Kleinfleißkees, Austrian Alps). The sequence
  of snow-cover modelling consists of the simulation of the wind field with a mesoscale
  atmospheric model, a three-dimensional finite-element drift module, an energy-balance
  module and a snowpack module. All modules with the exception of the wind-field model
  are integrated within the Alpine3D model frame. The drift module of Alpine3D distinguishes
  between saltation and suspension and is able to capture preferential deposition
  of snow precipitation and redistribution of previously deposited snow. Validation
  of the simulated snow depth is done using the spatially dense snow-probing dataset
  collected during a campaign in May 2003. Simulated snow depths agree with measurements
  during winter 2002/03 at locations with detailed snow-height monitoring, taking
  into account the high spatial variability of snow depth on the glacier. Moreover,
  comparison of snow accumulation from model results with detailed probing on 1 May
  2003 for the total glacier area shows that Alpine3D is able to capture major patterns
  of spatial distribution of snow accumulation. For the first time, the Alpine3D approach
  of using high-resolution wind fields from a meteorological model and a physical
  description of snow transport could be validated for a very steep glacierized area
  and for a full accumulation season. The results show that drift is a dominant factor
  to be considered for detailed glacier mass balances. Another dominant factor not
  considered in this study may be snow redistribution due to avalanches.
