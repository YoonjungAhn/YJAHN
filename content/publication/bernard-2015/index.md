abstract: 'Ambient temperature and relative humidity are readily ava-ilable and thus
  tempting metrics for heat stress assessment. Two methods of using air temperature
  and relative humidity to create an index are Heat Index and Adjusted Temperature.
  The purposes of this article are: (1) to examine how well Heat Index and Adjusted
  Temperature estimated the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index, and (2) to suggest
  how Heat Index and Adjusted Temperature can be used to screen for heat stress level.
  Psychrometric relationships were used to estimate values of actual WBGT for conditions
  of air temperature, relative humidity, and radiant heat at an air speed of 0.5 m/s.
  A relationship between Heat Index [°F] and WBGT [°C] was described by WBGT = -0.0034
  HI2 + 0.96 HI - 34. At lower Heat Index values, the equation estimated WBGTs that
  were ±2°C-WBGT around the actual value, and to about ±0.5°C-WBGT for Heat Index
  values > 100°F. A relationship between Adjusted Temperature [°F] and WBGT [°C] was
  described by WBGT = 0.45 Tadj - 16. The actual WBGT was between 1°C-WBGT below the
  estimated value and 1.4°C-WBGT above. That is, there was a slight bias toward overestimating
  WBGT from Adjusted Temperature. Heat stress screening tables were constructed for
  metabolic rates of 180, 300, and 450 W. The screening decisions were divided into
  four categories: (1) < alert limit, (2) < exposure limit, (3) hourly time-weighted
  averages (TWAs) of work and recovery, and (4) a caution zone for an exposure > exposure
  limit at rest. The authors do not recommend using Heat Index or Adjusted Temperature
  instead of WBGT, but they may be used to screen for circumstances when a more detailed
  analysis using WBGT is appropriate. A particular weakness is accounting for radiant
  heat; and neither air speed nor clothing was considered.'
