abstract: Extreme heat events (EHEs) are increasing in frequency in large U.S. cities
  and are responsible for a greater annual number of climate-related fatalities, on
  average, than any other form of extreme weather. In addition, low-density, sprawling
  patterns of urban development have been associated with enhanced surface temperatures
  in urbanized areas.
