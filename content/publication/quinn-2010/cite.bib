 abstract = {Asthma disproportionately affects non-whites in urban areas and those of low socioeconomic status, yet asthma's social patterning is not well-explained by known risk factors. We hypothesized that disadvantaged urban populations experience acute and chronic housing stressors which produce psychological stress and impact health through biological and behavioral pathways. We examined eight outcomes: six child respiratory outcomes as well as parent and child general health, using data from 682 low-income, Chicago parents of diagnosed and undiagnosed asthmatic children. We created a continuous exposure, representing material, social and emotional dimensions of housing stressors, weighted by their parent-reported difficulty. We compared the 75th to the 25th quartile of exposure in adjusted binomial and negative binomial regression models. Higher risks and rates of poor health were associated with higher housing stressors for six of eight outcomes. The risk difference (RD) for poor/fair general health was larger for children [RD = 6.28 (95% CI 1.22, 11.35)] than for parents [RD=3.88 (95% CI -1.87, 9.63)]. The incidence rate difference (IRD) for exercise intolerance was nearly one extra day per 2 weeks for the higher exposure group [IRD=0.88 (95% CI 0.41, 1.35)]; nearly one-third extra day per 2 weeks for waking at night [IRD = 0.32 (95% CI 0.01, 0.63)]; and nearly one-third extra day per 6 months for unplanned medical visits [IRD=0.30 (95% CI 0.059, 0.54)]. Results contribute to the conceptualization of urban stress as a "social pollutant" and to the hypothesized role of stress in health disparities. Interventions to improve asthma outcomes must address individuals' reactions to stress while we seek structural solutions to residential stressors and health inequities.
