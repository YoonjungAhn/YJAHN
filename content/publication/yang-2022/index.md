abstract: As a fundamental aspect of the urban form, building height is a key attribute
  for reflecting human activities and human-environment interactions in the urban
  context. However, openly accessible building height maps covering the whole China
  remain sorely limited, particularly for spatially informed data. Here we developed
  a 1 km Ã— 1 km resolution building height dataset across China in 2017 using Spatially-informed
  Gaussian process regression (Si-GPR) and open-access Sentinel-1 data. Building height
  estimation was performed using the spatially-explicit Gaussian process regression
  (GPR) in 39 major Chinese cities where the spatially explicit and robust cadastral
  data are available and the spatially-implicit GPR for the remaining 304 cities,
  respectively. The cross-validation results indicated that the proposed Si-GPR model
  overall achieved considerable estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 4.22 m) across
  the entire country. Because of the implementation of local modelling, the spatially-explicit
  GPR outperformed (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.82 m) the spatially-implicit GPR (R2 = 0.72,
  RMSE = 6.46 m) for all low-rise, mid-rise, and high-rise buildings. This dataset,
  with extensive-coverage and high-accuracy, can support further studies on the characteristics,
  causes, and consequences of urbanization.
