abstract: In the Northeastern U.S., future heatwaves will increase in frequency, duration,
  and intensity due to climate change. A great deal of the research about the health
  impacts from extreme heat has used ambient meteorological measurements, which can
  result in exposure misclassification because buildings alter indoor temperatures
  and ambient temperatures are not uniform across cities. To characterize indoor temperature
  exposures during an extreme heat event in buildings with and without central air
  conditioning (AC), personal monitoring was conducted with 51 (central AC, n = 24;
  non-central AC, n = 27) low-income senior residents of public housing in Cambridge,
  Massachusetts in 2015, to comprehensively assess indoor temperatures, sleep, and
  physiological outcomes of galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate (HR), along
  with daily surveys of adaptive behaviors and health symptoms. As expected, non-central
  AC units (Tmean = 25.6° C) were significantly warmer than those with central AC
  (Tmean = 23.2° C, p < 0.001). With higher indoor temperatures, sleep was more disrupted
  and GSR and HR both increased (p < 0.001). However, there were no changes in hydration
  behaviors between residents of different buildings over time and few moderate/several
  health symptoms were reported. This suggests both a lack of behavioral adaptation
  and thermal decompensation beginning, highlighting the need to improve building
  cooling strategies and heat education to low-income senior residents, especially
  in historically cooler climates.
