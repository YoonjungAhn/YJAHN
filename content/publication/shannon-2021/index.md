abstract: For the last twenty years, scholarly research has relied primarily on food
  deserts as a way to frame geographic disparities in access to healthy foods. The
  results of this research have been empirically mixed, and the term itself has been
  critiqued as apolitical. Using the alternative framing of retailer redlining, I
  analyze the rapid growth of dollar stores in twenty-seven metropolitan areas in
  the United States. Locations for these stores increased by 62 percent nationally
  during this time period, an expansion that was consistent in all regions of the
  country. Using descriptive statistics, cross-sectional, and first-difference models,
  I analyze how neighborhoodsâ€™ racial makeup was associated with changes in dollar
  store proximity, controlling for household income, population, and overall retailer
  density. This analysis shows that proximity to dollar stores is highly associated
  with neighborhoods of color even when controlling for other factors. This result
  highlights how the growth of dollar stores and similar spaces designed for economically
  precarious households both reflect and, potentially, contribute to long histories
  of racial exclusion.
