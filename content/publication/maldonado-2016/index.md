abstract: The organizers of the 2014 US National Climate Assessment (NCA) made a concerted
  effort to reach out to and collaborate with Indigenous peoples, resulting in the
  most comprehensive information to date on climate change impacts to Indigenous peoples
  in a US national assessment. Yet, there is still much room for improvement in assessment
  processes to ensure adequate recognition of Indigenous perspectives and Indigenous
  knowledge systems. discusses the synergy and discord between traditional knowledge
  systems and science and the emergence of cross-cutting issues and vulnerabilities
  for Indigenous peoples. The challenges of coalescing information about climate change
  and its impacts on Indigenous communities are outlined along with recommendations
  on the types of information to include in future assessment outputs. We recommend
  that future assessments-not only NCA, but other relevant local, regional, national,
  and international efforts aimed at the translation of climate information and assessments
  into meaningful actions-should support integration of Indigenous perspectives in
  a sustained way that builds respectful relationships and effectively engages Indigenous
  communities. Given the large number of tribes in the US and the current challenges
  and unique vulnerabilities of Indigenous communities, a special report focusing
  solely on climate change and Indigenous peoples is warranted. BClimate changeâ€¦remind[s]
  us that, as my Lakota relatives say, 'We are all related.' That might be the wisdom
  we need most whether scientist or non-scientist-Indigenous or non-Indigenous.^-Dr.
