abstract: 'Objective: To present evidence-based recommendations that promote optimized
  fluid-maintenance practices for physically active individuals. Background: Both
  a lack of adequate fluid replacement (hypohydration) and excessive intake (hyperhydration)
  can compromise athletic performance and increase health risks. Athletes need access
  to water to prevent hypohydration during physical activity but must be aware of
  the risks of overdrinking and hyponatremia. Drinking behavior can be modified by
  education, accessibility, experience, and palatability. This statement updates practical
  recommendations regarding fluid-replacement strategies for physically active individuals.
  Recommendations: Educate physically active people regarding the benefits of fluid
  replacement to promote performance and safety and the potential risks of both hypohydration
  and hyperhydration on health and physical performance. Quantify sweat rates for
  physically active individuals during exercise in various environments. Work with
  individuals to develop fluid-replacement practices that promote sufficient but not
  excessive hydration before, during, and after physical activity. I n humans, total
  body water and overall hydration are normally maintained within a relatively narrow
  range (1% hyperhydration to 3% hypohydration). 1,2 The benefits of optimal hydration
  status include maintaining athletic performance, 3À6 maximizing the transfer of
  metabolic heat, 5,7 maintaining mood, 8,9 and facilitating recovery from exercise.
  10,11 All may be compromised at modest levels of hypohydration (approximately 2%).
  5,9 However, extreme deviations on either end of the physiological range (hypohydration
  or hyperhydration) can compromise health and organ function. 12À14 A majority (more
  than 50%) of athletes in professional sports, 15 collegiate athletics, 16,17 and
  high school 18 and youth sports 19,20 arrive at workouts hypohydrated. When access
  to fluids based on thirst and voluntary fluid intake is adequate during activity,
  humans replace roughly two-thirds of sweat losses. 21À25 Maintaining hydration status
  with minimal variation (þ1% to-1%) allows the body to optimally thermoregu-late
  5,26,27 and maintain cardiovascular function. 7,28,29 Evap-orative heat loss is
  the most effective mode of heat dissipation in warm or hot conditions. If the eccrine
  sweating mechanism is compromised due to a lack of available body fluid, core temperature
  increases above that expected for the activity and environment. 30,31 Appropriate
  hydration is similarly important for physical activity at Journal of Athletic Training
