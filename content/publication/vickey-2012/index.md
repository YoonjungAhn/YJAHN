abstract: The purpose of this study was to research the new emerging technology of
  mobile health, the use of mobile fitness apps to share one's workout with their
  Twitter social network, the workout tweets and the individualities of the Tweeters.
  70,748 tweets from mobile fitness application Endomondo were processed using an
  online tweet collection application and a customized JavaScript to determine aspects
  of the shared workouts and the demographics of those that share. The data shows
  that by tracking mobile fitness app hashtags, a wealth of information can be gathered
  to include but not limited to exercise frequency, daily use patterns, location based
  workouts and language characteristics. While a majority of these tweets are to share
  a specific workout with their Twitter social networking, the data would suggest
  other reasons for sharing as well. Copyright Â© 2011, Association for the Advancement
