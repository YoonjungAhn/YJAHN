abstract: Objectives. This study assessed whether aggregate-level measures of socioeconomic
  status (SES) are less biased as proxies for individual-level measures if the unit
  of geographic aggregation is small in size and population. Methods. National Health
  Interview Survey and census data were used to replicate analyses that identified
  the degree to which aggregate proxies of individual SES bias interpretations of
  the effects of SES on health. Results. Ordinary least squares regressions on self-perceived
  health showed that the coefficients for income and education measured at the tract
  and block group levels were larger than those at the individual level but smaller
  than those estimated by Geronimus et al. at the zip code level. Conclusions. Researchers
  should be cautious about use of proxy measurement of individual SES even if proxies
  are calculated from small geographic units.
