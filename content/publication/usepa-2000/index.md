abstract: This document updates the June 1987 EPA document, \"On-Site Meteorological
  Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications\", EPA-450/4-87-013. The most
  significant change is the replacement of Section 9 with more comprehensive guidance
  on remote sensing and conventional radiosonde technologies for use in upper-air
  meteorological monitoring; previously this section provided guidance on the use
  of sodar technology. The other significant change is the addition to Section 8 (Quality
  Assurance) of material covering data validation for upper-air meteorological measurements.
  These changes incorporate guidance developed during the workshop on upper-air meteorological
  monitoring in July 1998
