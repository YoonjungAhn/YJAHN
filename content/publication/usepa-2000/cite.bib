 abstract = {This document updates the June 1987 EPA document, "On-Site Meteorological Program Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications", EPA-450/4-87-013. The most significant change is the replacement of Section 9 with more comprehensive guidance on remote sensing and conventional radiosonde technologies for use in upper-air meteorological monitoring; previously this section provided guidance on the use of sodar technology. The other significant change is the addition to Section 8 (Quality Assurance) of material covering data validation for upper-air meteorological measurements. These changes incorporate guidance developed during the workshop on upper-air meteorological monitoring in July 1998},
