abstract: We applied a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to study the correlations
  of total PM2.5 and its components with meteorological variables using an 11-year
  (1998-2008) observational record over the contiguous US. The data were deseasonalized
  and detrended to focus on synoptic-scale correlations. We find that daily variation
  in meteorology as described by the MLR can explain up to 50% of PM2.5 variability
  with temperature, relative humidity (RH), precipitation, and circulation all being
  important predictors. Temperature is positively correlated with sulfate, organic
  carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) almost everywhere. The correlation of nitrate
  with temperature is negative in the Southeast but positive in California and the
  Great Plains. RH is positively correlated with sulfate and nitrate, but negatively
  with OC and EC. Precipitation is strongly negatively correlated with all PM2.5 components.
  We find that PM2.5 concentrations are on average 2.6 μg m-3 higher on stagnant vs.
  non-stagnant days. Our observed correlations provide a test for chemical transport
  models used to simulate the sensitivity of PM2.5 to climate change. They point to
  the importance of adequately representing the temperature dependence of agricultural,
  biogenic and wildfire emissions in these models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
