abstract: The National Center for Health Statistics recently issued a monograph with
  11 guidelines for reporting health disparities. However, guidelines on confidence
  intervals (CIs) cannot be readily implemented with the complex sample surveys often
  used for disease surveillance. In the United States, dental caries (decay) is the
  most common chronic childhood disease - 5 times more common than asthma. Racial/ethnic
  minorities, immigrants, and persons of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) have a
  greater prevalence of caries. The authors provide methods for applying National
  Center for Health Statistics guidelines to complex sample surveys (health disparity
  indices and absolute and relative difference measures assessing associations of
  race/ethnicity and SEP to health outcomes with CIs); illustrate the application
  of those methods to children's untreated caries; provide relevant software; and
  report results from a simulation varying prevalence. They use data on untreated
  caries from the California Oral Health Needs Assessment of Children 2004-2005 and
  school percentage of participation in free/reduced-price lunch programs to illustrate
  the methods. Absolute and relative measures, the Slope Index of Inequality, the
  Relative Index of Inequality (mean and ratio), and the Health Concentration Index
  were estimated. Taylor series linearization and rescaling bootstrap methods were
  used to estimate CIs. Oral health differed significantly between White children
  and all non-White children and was significantly related to SEP.
