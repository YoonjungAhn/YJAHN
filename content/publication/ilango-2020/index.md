abstract: 'Background: Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality.
  Identifying potentially modifiable triggers toward the end of gestation, such as
  extreme heat, can improve understanding of the role of acute stress on early deliveries
  and inform warning systems. In this study we examined the association between extreme
  heat, variously defined during the last week of gestation, and risk of preterm birth
  among mothers in California. Methods: We created a population-based cohort comprised
  of 1,967,300 mothers who had live, singleton births in California, from May through
  September 2005–2013. Daily temperature data estimated at the maternal zip code of
  residence was used to create 12 definitions of extreme heat with varying relative
  temperatures (75th, 90th, 95th, and 98th percentiles) and durations (at least 2,
  3, or 4 consecutive days). We estimated risk of preterm birth (<37 gestational weeks)
  in relation to exposure to extreme heat during the last week of gestation with multi-level
  Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for maternal characteristics,
  sex of neonate, and seasonality. We also included randomly generated data, SAS code,
  and estimates for reproducibility purposes. Results: Approximately 7% of the cohort
  had a preterm birth. For all definitions of extreme heat, the risk of preterm birth
  was consistently higher among mothers who experienced an extreme heat episode during
  their last week of gestation. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.008 (95% CI: 0.997, 1.021)
  to 1.128 (95% CI: 1.052, 1.210), with increasing associations as the relative temperature
  and duration of extreme heat episode increased. Conclusion: This study adds to the
  previous literature by considering multiple definitions of extreme heat and applying
  a time-to-event framework. Findings suggest that acute exposure to extreme heat
  during the last week of gestation may trigger an earlier delivery. Implementing
  heat warning systems targeted toward pregnant women may improve birth outcomes.'
