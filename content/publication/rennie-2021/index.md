abstract: Extreme heat is one of the most pressing climate risks in the United States
  and is exacerbated by a warming climate and aging population. Much work in heat
  health has focused only on temperature-based metrics, which do not fully measure
  the physiological impact of heat stress on the human body. The U.S. Climate Reference
  Network (USCRN) consists of 139 sites across the United States and includes meteorological
  parameters that fully encompass human tolerance to heat, including relative humidity,
  wind, and solar radiation. Hourly and 5-min observations from USCRN are used to
  develop heat exposure products, including heat index (HI), apparent temperature
  (AT), and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Validation of this product is conducted
  with nearby airport and mesonet stations, with reanalysis data used to fill in data
  gaps. Using these derived heat products, two separate analyses are conducted. The
  first is based on standardized anomalies, which place current heat state in the
  context of a long-term climate record. In the second study, heat events are classified
  by time spent at various levels of severity of conditions. There is no consensus
  as to what defines a heat event, so a comparison of absolute thresholds (i.e., $30.08,
  35.08, and 40.08C) and relative thresholds ($90th, 95th, and 98th percentile) will
  be examined. The efficacy of the product set will be studied using an extreme heat
  case study in the southeastern United States. While no heat exposure metric is deemed
  superior, each has their own advantages and caveats, especially in the context of
  public communication.
