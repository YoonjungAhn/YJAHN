abstract: 'Context: Weather-based activity modification in athletics is an important
  way to minimize heat illnesses. However, many commonly used heat-safety guidelines
  include a uniform set of heat-stress thresholds that do not account for geographic
  differences in acclimatization. Objective: To determine if heat-related fatalities
  among American football players occurred on days with unusually stressful weather
  conditions based on the local climate and to assess the need for regional heat-safety
  guidelines. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Data from incidents of fatal
  exertional heat stroke (EHS) in American football players were obtained from the
  National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research and the Korey Stringer Institute.
  Patients or Other Participants: Sixty-one American football players at all levels
  of competition with fatal EHSs from 1980 to 2014. Main Outcome Measure(s): We used
  the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and a z-score WBGT standardized to local climate
  conditions from 1991 to 2010 to assess the absolute and relative magnitudes of heat
  stress, respectively. Results: We observed a poleward decrease in exposure WBGTs
  during fatal EHSs. In milder climates, 80% of cases occurred at above-average WBGTs,
  and 50% occurred at WBGTs greater than 1 standard deviation from the long-term mean;
  however, in hotter climates, half of the cases occurred at near average or below
  average WBGTs. Conclusions: The combination of lower exposure WBGTs and frequent
  extreme climatic values in milder climates during fatal EHSs indicates the need
  for regional activity-modification guidelines with lower, climatically appropriate
  weather-based thresholds. Established activity-modification guidelines, such as
  those from the American College of Sports Medicine, work well in the hotter climates,
  such as the southern United States, where hot and humid weather conditions are common.'
