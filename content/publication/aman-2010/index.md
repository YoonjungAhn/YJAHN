abstract: Over half the mobile homes in the United States are located in rural America,
  where they are a popular but understudied alternative to site-built houses. Using
  tax assessment and mail survey data gathered for mobile homes in several rural Pennsylvania
  counties, we show that residents are overwhelmingly satisfied with mobile home life,
  but that they face unique challenges related to their housing choice. Survey data
  reveal issues of land tenure and financing, social stigma, and hidden costs of mobile
  home ownership, and demonstrate that mobile homes provide both opportunities and
  challenges for rural communities. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
