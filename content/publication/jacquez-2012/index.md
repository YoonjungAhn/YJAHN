abstract: 'Until recently, little attention has been paid to geocoding positional
  accuracy and its impacts on accessibility measures; estimates of disease rates;
  findings of disease clustering; spatial prediction and modeling of health outcomes;
  and estimates of individual exposures based on geographic proximity to pollutant
  and pathogen sources. It is now clear that positional errors can result in flawed
  findings and poor public health decisions. Yet the current state-of-practice is
  to ignore geocoding positional uncertainty, primarily because of a lack of theory,
  methods and tools for quantifying, modeling, and adjusting for geocoding positional
  errors in health analysis.This paper proposes a research agenda to address this
  need. It summarizes the basics of the geocoding process, its assumptions, and empirical
  evidence describing the magnitude of geocoding positional error. An overview of
  the impacts of positional error in health analysis, including accessibility, disease
  clustering, exposure reconstruction, and spatial weights estimation is presented.
  The proposed research agenda addresses five key needs: (1) a lack of standardized,
  open-access geocoding resources for use in health research; (2) a lack of geocoding
  validation datasets that will allow the evaluation of alternative geocoding engines
  and procedures; (3) a lack of spatially explicit geocoding positional error models;
  (4) a lack of resources for assessing the sensitivity of spatial analysis results
  to geocoding positional error; (5) a lack of demonstration studies that illustrate
  the sensitivity of health policy decisions to geocoding positional error. Â© 2012
