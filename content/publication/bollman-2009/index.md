abstract: This paper reviews the key demographic, employment, income, and social capital
  features of rural Canada. Rural populations have different characteristics that
  are typically a direct result of \"rurality\"-i.e., long distances and low population
  density. Jobs that require a high-density population (such as a professional hockey
  player) are not available to individuals who live at a distance from a metro center.
  Rural Canada may have an agricultural landscape (or a forestry or mining landscape)
  but the vast majority of rural workers do not work in primary sectors. Manufacturing
  employment is larger. Rural Canada is competitive in manufacturing-rural areas are
  gaining a larger share of Canada's manufacturing workforce. Rural incomes are lower,
  on average. But lower living costs mean that the rural incidence of low incomes
  is similar to urban. In rural communities, the existence of social networks does
  not always imply that these networks are used. Networks are complementary-one network
  does not always substitute for another. However, local strength in one network can
  be used to build capacity in another network.
