abstract: 'The primary aim of this analysis was to present and describe questionnaire
  data characterizing time-location patterns of an older, multiethnic population from
  six American cities. We evaluated the consistency of results from repeated administration
  of this questionnaire and between this questionnaire and other questionnaires collected
  from participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution
  (MESA Air). Participants reported spending most of their time inside their homes
  (average: 121 h/week or 72%). More than 50% of the participants reported spending
  no time in several of the location options, including at home outdoors, at work/volunteer/school
  locations indoors or outdoors, or in \"other\" locations outdoors. We observed consistency
  between self-reported time-location patterns from repeated administration of the
  time-location questionnaire and compared with other survey instruments. Comparisons
  with national cohorts demonstrated the differences in time-location patterns in
  the MESA Air cohort due to differences in demographics, but the data showed similar
  trends in patterns by age, gender, season, and employment status. This study was
  the first to explicitly examine the time-location patterns in an older, multiethnic
  population and the first to add data on Chinese participants. These data can be
  used to inform future epidemiological research of MESA Air and other studies that
  include diverse populations.'
