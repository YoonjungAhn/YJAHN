abstract: In the past five years, the southern region of the United States has had
  a large number of fatal tornadoes. Previous research indicates that residents of
  this area may not be taking appropriate shelter. The present study uses a random
  sample of Tennessee residents (N = 1126) and the latent class analysis (LCA) technique
  to explore discrete types of responders according to their pattern of intended behaviors
  when presented with a tornado warning scenario in the daytime or nighttime. LCA
  revealed three distinct groups in the day subsample – Tech Users, Typical Actors,
  and Passive Reactors – and three in the night subsample – Tech Users, Typical Actors,
  and Non-Reactors. Being a Tech User or Typical Actor was positively associated with
  intending to seek safe shelter, although being a Passive Reactor or Non-Reactor
  was not. Further, Tech Users/Typical Actors were seeking and obtaining more warning
  information from other sources compared to Passive Reactors/Non-Reactors. While
  few demographic variables were associated with class assignment, bivariate and multivariate
  analyses illustrated that cognitive factors, such as previous experience with tornadoes
  and perceived accuracy of warnings, are significantly associated with class membership
  when controlling for non-cognitive factors. The distinctions made within and between
  the subsamples can support the National Weather Service's efforts to better target
  the public with future messages about tornado safety as well as guide researchers
  on future studies.
