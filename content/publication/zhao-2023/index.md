abstract: 'Urban construction has accelerated the deterioration of the urban sound
  environment, which has constrained urban development and harmed people’s health.
  This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of environmental sound and
  determine the influencing factors on the spatial differentiation of sound, thus
  supporting sustainable urban planning and decision-making. Fine-grained sound data
  are used in most urban sound-related research, but such data are difficult to obtain.
  For this problem, this study analyzed sound trends using Array of Things (AoT) sensing
  data. Additionally, this study explored the influences on the spatial differentiation
  of sound using GeoDetector (version number: 1.0-4), thus addressing the limitation
  of previous studies that neglected to explore the influences on spatial heterogeneity.
  Our experimental results showed that sound levels in different areas of Chicago
  fluctuated irregularly over time. During the morning peak on weekdays: the four
  southern areas of Chicago have a high–high sound gathering mode, and the remaining
  areas are mostly randomly distributed; the sound level of a certain area has a significant
  negative correlation with population density, park area, and density of bike route;
  park area and population density are the main factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity
  of Chicago’s sound; and population density and park area play an essential role
  in factor interaction. This study has some theoretical significance and practical
  value. Residents can choose areas with lower noise for leisure activities according
  to the noise map of this study. While planning urban development, urban planners
  should pay attention to the single and interactive effects of factors in the city,
  such as parks, road network structures, and points of interest, on the urban sound
  environment. Researchers can build on this study to conduct studies on larger time
  scales.'
