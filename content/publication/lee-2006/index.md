abstract: 'Purpose: The quality and economy of inferential research rely heavily on
  the sampling method. This paper addresses a methodological challenge in environment-behavior
  research: sampling respondents in relation to their built environmental characteristics.
  Methods: A discussion of issues related to traditional neighborhood-based sampling
  serves to introduce a new spatial sampling strategy. Spatial sampling consists of
  defining conceptual population of interest, constructing spatial sample frame using
  parcel-level environmental data in GIS, examining the sample frame, determining
  the sampling design and size, and drawing the samples. An application of this method
  is illustrated using a recent study examining environmental correlates of walking
  and biking. Results: Spatial sampling with parcel-level data ensures sufficient
  variations in and proper distributions of the environmental variables of interest,
  while controlling for the conditions of no interest. The use of the individual as
  unit of analysis offers an economic, generalizable, and easily interpretable approach
  to environment-behavior research, and discourages the potentially erroneous a priori
  definition of neighborhoods and aggregation problems. Conclusions: With its capacity
  to consider a broad range of detailed environmental variables, spatial sampling
  contributes to finding new or stronger environment-behavior associations and to
  the growing number of studies using the social ecologic model. Â© 2006 Elsevier Inc.
