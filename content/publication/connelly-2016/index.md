abstract: The term big data is currently a buzzword in social science, however its
  precise meaning is ambiguous. In this paper we focus on administrative data which
  is a distinctive form of big data. Exciting new opportunities for social science
  research will be afforded by new administrative data resources, but these are currently
  under appreciated by the research community. The central aim of this paper is to
  discuss the challenges associated with administrative data. We emphasise that it
  is critical for researchers to carefully consider how administrative data has been
  produced. We conclude that administrative datasets have the potential to contribute
  to the development of high-quality and impactful social science research, and should
  not be overlooked in the emerging field of big data.
