abstract: In this article, we review critical research on mobile and wearable health
  technologies focused on the promotion of ‘healthy lifestyles’. We begin by discussing
  key governmental and policy interests which indicate a shift towards greater digital
  integration in health care. Subsequently, we review relevant research literature,
  which highlights concerns about inclusion, social justice, and ownership of mobile
  health data, which we argue, provoke a series of key sociological questions that
  are in need of additional investigation. We examine the expansion of what counts
  as health data, as a basis for advocating the need for greater research into this
  area. Finally, we consider how digital devices raise questions about the reconfiguration
  of relationships, behaviours, and concepts of individuality.
