abstract: This work investigates whether and how COVID-19 containment policies had
  an immediate impact on crime trends in Los Angeles. The analysis is conducted using
  Bayesian structural time-series and focuses on nine crime categories and on the
  overall crime count, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. We
  concentrate on two post-intervention time windows—from March 4th to March 16th and
  from March 4th to March 28th 2020—to dynamically assess the short-term effects of
  mild and strict policies. In Los Angeles, overall crime has significantly decreased,
  as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft, and battery. No significant effect has been
  detected for vehicle theft, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, intimate partner
  assault, and homicide. Results suggest that, in the first weeks after the interventions
  are put in place, social distancing impacts more directly on instrumental and less
  serious crimes. Policy implications are also discussed.
