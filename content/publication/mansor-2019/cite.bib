 abstract = {Introduction: The heat-related illness (HRI) is a continuum illness ranging from minor health effects to life-threatening medical emergencies when the pathological effects of heat load are not prevented. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the threshold HRI symptom for deciding to take simple preventative actions both by the individual workers and employers. Method: A total of 328 municipal workers were enrolled in April to March 2016 were asked to recall if they experienced eleven HRI symptoms during the previous work day. Rasch Measurement Model was used to examine the unidimensional parameters and bias for gender before identifying the threshold of HRI symptoms. We determined the threshold symptom based on the person-item map distribution on a logit ruler value. Results: A total of 320 respondents were analysed. The psychometric features HRI symptoms suggested evidence of unidimensionality and free of bias for gender (DIF size =0.57; DIF t value =1.03). Based on the person-item map distribution, the thirst item was determined as the threshold item (Cut-off point =-2.17 logit) for the preventative action purposes to group the person as mild and moderate/severe HRI groups. Conclusion: Thirst item is viewed as threshold symptoms between mild and moderate or severe HRI symptoms. It is a reliable symptom to initiate behavioural response to quench the thirst by adequate fluids. Failure to recognise the thirst symptom may lead to devastating unwanted health complications.},
