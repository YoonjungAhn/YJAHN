abstract: 'Introduction: The heat-related illness (HRI) is a continuum illness ranging
  from minor health effects to life-threatening medical emergencies when the pathological
  effects of heat load are not prevented. The aim of this study was to demonstrate
  the threshold HRI symptom for deciding to take simple preventative actions both
  by the individual workers and employers. Method: A total of 328 municipal workers
  were enrolled in April to March 2016 were asked to recall if they experienced eleven
  HRI symptoms during the previous work day. Rasch Measurement Model was used to examine
  the unidimensional parameters and bias for gender before identifying the threshold
  of HRI symptoms. We determined the threshold symptom based on the person-item map
  distribution on a logit ruler value. Results: A total of 320 respondents were analysed.
  The psychometric features HRI symptoms suggested evidence of unidimensionality and
  free of bias for gender (DIF size =0.57; DIF t value =1.03). Based on the person-item
  map distribution, the thirst item was determined as the threshold item (Cut-off
  point =-2.17 logit) for the preventative action purposes to group the person as
  mild and moderate/severe HRI groups. Conclusion: Thirst item is viewed as threshold
  symptoms between mild and moderate or severe HRI symptoms. It is a reliable symptom
  to initiate behavioural response to quench the thirst by adequate fluids. Failure
  to recognise the thirst symptom may lead to devastating unwanted health complications.'
