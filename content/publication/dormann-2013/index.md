abstract: Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually
  in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological
  data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance
  of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification
  of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem
  when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another
  with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach
  of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors
  differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines,
  different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging
  from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable
  methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response
  relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared
  ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning
  approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on
  prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able
  to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity
  by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found
  that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods
  and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based
  pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised
  methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables
  are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded
  degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the 'folk lore'-thresholds
  of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of |r| >0.7 was an appropriate
  indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and
  subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis
  variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches
  reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them. © 2012 The
