abstract: activity level. This information was used to build an appropriate repeated
  measures model including demographics and work-related attributes. Results Final
  analyses included 318 Latina/o farmworkers. Only 70 subjects (22%) were a healthy
  BMI, and 115 subjects (36%) were considered obese (BMI !30). None were underweight.
  The majority of participants were paid hourly (n=233, 73%) as opposed to piece-rate
  (n=85, 27%). Activity counts averaged 452, or a low intensity activity level. In
  the final repeat measures model, work activity was inversely associated with WBGT,
  for every oC increase in WBGT activity decreased by 4.5 counts (95% CI 1.2-7.6)
  P 0.01. Other independent negative associations with activity were found with age
  and male gender. An interaction was found between piece-rate workers and gender.
  Male piece rate workers did not decrease activity levels with WBGT, but females
  and hourly paid workers did. Conclusion In general, farmworkers decrease their work
  activity with increasing environmental heat. Men, especially piece-rate workers
  are less likely to decrease their activity levels putting them at increased risk
  of HRI. There have been many laboratory studies of the effect of heat on the health
  of individuals in sport, at work or in the military. However, epidemiological studies
  are needed to develop impact assessment of climate change. In this presentation
  we outline the development and use of population-exposure risk functions for different
  heat effects. The first risk function is for heat discomfort based on the predicted
  mean vote with 10% population feeling discomfort at WBGT=21C and with 90% affected
  at 29C. The second population risk function is for heat exhaustion which we derive
  by using epidemiological data from the US military. 10% of the population is affected
  by heat exhaustion at WBGT=31C increasing up to 90% of the population affected at
  a WBGT=38C. The most severe population risk is heat stroke for which we use hospital
  data to calculate 10% of the population affected by heat stroke at WBGT=41C and
  90% of the population at WBGT=44C. These health effects of heat create different
  durations of ill health, with serious heat stroke causing prolonged periods of disability.
  Based on climate modelling and our risk functions the number of people affected
  globally can be calculated. For heat stroke, few persons working in the shade at
  300W metabolic rate, will currently suffer from heat levels that can cause heat
  stroke. By 2085 half a million workers (at 300W) will be exposed to heat levels
  that cause heat stroke. As for becoming totally exhausted (and unable to work) while
  working at 300W in the sun, currently that stands at about 124 million worldwide,
  but in 2085 that number will jump to 835 million. Additional epidemiological studies
  are utilised to validate these risk estimates at local and national level. Introduction
  Hot weather poses occupational health and safety concerns for outdoor workers or
  those in non-cooled indoor environments. The risk of occupational injuries increases
  during hot weather, however limited understanding exists on underlying factors associated
  with this increase in risk. While recommendations and guidelines for preventing
  heat-related health impacts include hydration, cooling practices, adequate ventilation
  and rescheduling work, the extent to which these recommendations are adopted in
  workplaces is currently unknown. Methods A national online survey was conducted
  among health and safety representatives (HSRs) to better understand the nature of
  heat-related injuries. Responses relating to risk factors and preventive measures
  associated with reported injuries in workplaces were identified using log-poisson
  regression models. Results In total, 222 HSRs completed the survey. Overall, more
  than a third (43%) of HSRs reported that injuries or incidents caused by hot/very
  humid weather occur sometimes/ often in their workplace. Factors found to be positively
  associated with reported injuries included 'the wearing of personal protective equipment
  (PPE)', 'inadequate resources and facilities' and 'new workers'. For outdoor workers,
  the most frequently adopted preventive measures were provision of PPE, sunscreen
  and access to cool drinking water. HSRs reported more injuries if certain preventive
  measures (rescheduling work to cooler times and shaded rest/work areas) were adopted
  never/rarely/sometimes compared to often/always. Access to cool drinking water and
  provision of PPE were the most frequently adopted preventive measures for indoor
  workers. For this group, HSRs reported more injuries if certain preventive measures
  (self-pacing, shielding of heat sources and adequate ventilation) were adopted never/rarely/
  sometimes. Conclusion Findings indicate that organisational issues, workplace hazards,
  personal factors and preventive measures, are all determinants of heat-related injuries
  in Australian workplaces. Wider adoption of prevention measures such as work rescheduling,
  self-pacing, provision of shade and adequate ventilation could reduce incidence
  of heat-related injuries in outdoor and indoor workplaces.
