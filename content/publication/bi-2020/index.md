abstract: Regulatory monitoring networks are often too sparse to support community-scale
  PM2.5 exposure assessment while emerging low-cost sensors have the potential to
  fill in the gaps. To date, limited studies, if any, have been conducted to utilize
  low-cost sensor measurements to improve PM2.5 prediction with high spatiotemporal
  resolutions based on statistical models. Imperial County in California is an exemplary
  region with sparse Air Quality System (AQS) monitors and a community-operated low-cost
  network entitled Identifying Violations Affecting Neighborhoods (IVAN). This study
  aims to evaluate the contribution of IVAN measurements to the quality of PM2.5 prediction.
  We adopted the Random Forest algorithm to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at
  a 1-km spatial resolution using three different PM2.5 datasets (AQS-only, IVAN-only,
  and AQS/IVAN combined). The results show that the integration of low-cost sensor
  measurements is an effective way to significantly improve the quality of PM2.5 prediction
  with an increase of cross-validation (CV) R2 by ~0.2. The IVAN measurements also
  contributed to the increased importance of emission source-related covariates and
  more reasonable spatial patterns of PM2.5. The remaining uncertainty in the calibrated
  IVAN measurements could still cause apparent outliers in the prediction model, highlighting
  the need for more effective calibration or integration methods to relieve its negative
  impact.
