abstract: Although it is often acknowledged that social and environmental factors
  interact to produce racial and ethnic environmental health disparities, it is still
  unclear how this occurs. Despite continued controversy, the environmental justice
  movement has provided some insight by suggesting that disadvantaged communities
  face greater likelihood of exposure to ambient hazards. The exposure-disease paradigm
  has long suggested that differential \"vulnerability\" may modify the effects of
  toxicants on biological systems. However, relatively little work has been done to
  specify whether racial and ethnic minorities may have greater vulnerability than
  do majority populations and, further, what these vulnerabilities may be. We suggest
  that psychosocial stress may be the vulnerability factor that links social conditions
  with environmental hazards. Psychosocial stress can lead to acute and chronic changes
  in the functioning of body systems (e.g., immune) and also lead directly to illness.
  In this article we present a multidisciplinary framework integrating these ideas.
  We also argue that residential segregation leads to differential experiences of
  community stress, exposure to pollutants, and access to community resources. When
  not counterbalanced by resources, stressors may lead to heightened vulnerability
  to environmental hazards.
