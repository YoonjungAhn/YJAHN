abstract: There is near consensus in the scientific community that humans will experience
  higher future temperatures due to the ongoing accumulation of greenhouse gases in
  the atmosphere. The human response to this climatic change, particularly if accompanied
  by a surge in extreme heat events, is a key topic being addressed by scientists
  across many disciplines. In this article, we review recent (2012-2015) research
  on human health impacts of observed and projected increases in summer temperature.
  We find that studies based on projected changes in climate indicate substantial
  increases in heat-related mortality and morbidity in the future, while observational
  studies based on historical climate and health records show a decrease in negative
  impacts during recent warming. The discrepancy between the two groups of studies
  generally involves how well and how quickly humans can adapt to changes in climate
  via physiological, behavioral, infrastructural , and/or technological adaptation,
  and how such adaptation is quantified.
