abstract: Low-cost air quality sensor networks have been increasingly used for high
  spatial resolution air quality monitoring in recent years. Ensuring data reliability
  during continuous operation is critical for these sensor networks. Using particulate
  matter sensor as an example, this study reports a data quality control method, including
  sensor selection, pre-calibration, and online inspection. It was used in developing
  and operating the dense low-cost particle sensor networks in two Chinese cities.
  Firstly, seven mainstream sensors were tested and one model of particle sensor was
  selected due to its better linearity and stability. For a batch of sensors of the
  same model, although they were calibrated after manufactured, there are differences
  in response toward the same concentration of pollutants. The systematical variation
  of sensors was corrected and unified through pre-calibration. After deploying them
  in the field, a data analysis method is established for online inspecting their
  working status. Using data from these sensors, it evaluates parameters such as intraclass
  correlation coefficients and normalized root mean square error. These two metrics
  help to construct a two-dimensional coordinate system and to classify sensors into
  four status, including normal, fluctuation, hotspots, and malfunction. During a
  one-month operation in the two cities, 8 (out of 82) and 10 (out of 59) sensors
  with suspected malfunctions were screened out for further on-site inspection. Moreover,
  the sensor networks show potential in identifying illegal emission sources that
  cannot be typically detected by sparse regulatory air quality monitoring stations.
