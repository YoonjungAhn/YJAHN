abstract: Weather and climate affect human and several aspects of the planet Earth.
  The Köppen-Geiger system is widely used for describing and analysing thermal comfort
  according to climate. However, little is available about the Köppen's system in
  predicting and evaluating the comfort temperature. This investigation addressed
  some observed issues in using the Köppen-Geiger system for thermal comfort studies.
  The origin data of the present case study is from the RP-884 database. The selected
  location is Melbourne city. The climate of Melbourne city was categorised (Cfb).
  The subjects of the case study were mostly exposed to dry environment. Long-term
  projections showed that the climate will shift from (Cfb) to (Cfa). Despite the
  wide range of the indoor air temperature, the shift from neutrality to slightly
  cool or slightly warm was very narrow. Major issues of Köppen's system in evaluating
  neutral temperatures according to climate types in Melbourne city were also addressed.
  The use of GIS for future thermal comfort meta-analysis was recommended.
