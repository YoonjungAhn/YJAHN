abstract: Background Recent research suggests that heat exposure may increase the
  risk of traumatic injuries. Published heat-related epidemiological studies have
  relied upon exposure data from individual weather stations. Objective To evaluate
  the association between heat exposure and traumatic injuries in outdoor agricultural
  workers exposed to ambient heat and internal heat generated by physical activity
  using modeled ambient exposure data. Methods A case-crossover study using time-stratified
  referent selection among 12,213 outdoor agricultural workers with new Washington
  State Fund workers' compensation traumatic injury claims between 2000 and 2012 was
  conducted. Maximum daily Humidex exposures, derived from modeled meteorological
  data, were assigned to latitudes and longitudes of injury locations on injury and
  referent dates. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios
  of injury for a priori daily maximum Humidex categories. Results The mean of within-stratum
  (injury day and corresponding referent days) standard deviations of daily maximum
  Humidex was 4.8. The traumatic injury odds ratio was 1.14 (95% confidence interval
  1.06, 1.22), 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.06, 1.25), and 1.10 (95% confidence
  interval 1.01, 1.20) for daily maximum Humidex of 25-29, 30-33, and â‰¥34, respectively,
  compared to < 25, adjusted for self-reported duration of employment. Stronger associations
  were observed during cherry harvest duties in the June and July time period, compared
  to all duties over the entire study period. Conclusions Agricultural workers laboring
  in warm conditions are at risk for heat-related traumatic injuries. Combined heat-related
  illness and injury prevention efforts should be considered in high-risk populations
  exposed to warm ambient conditions in the setting of physical exertion.
