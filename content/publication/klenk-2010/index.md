abstract: 'Background: in population-based studies, age and morbidity were associated
  with heat-related mortality. The nursing home population reveals both factors and
  may represent a highly vulnerable subgroup. Therefore, temperature-mortality relationship
  was examined in residents of nursing homes. Methods: the association between daily
  ambient maximum temperature and mortality was analysed in 95,808 nursing home residents
  in southwest Germany between 2001 and 2005. Time series analyses were applied across
  age groups, sex and functional abilities. In addition, excess mortality was determined
  for the 2003 heat wave. Results: mortality risk was lowest at maximum temperatures
  between 16 and 25.9°C. Risk increased by 26 and 62% at days of 32.0-33.9 and 34°C
  and more, respectively. In August 2003, heat caused >400 additional deaths in the
  observed population and was followed by only a moderate mortality displacement in
  the following months. The excess number of deaths during the heat wave was particularly
  high in residents aged >90 years and in residents with higher care needs. Conclusion:
  high ambient temperature was associated with an increased mortality risk in all
  analysed subgroups of the nursing home population. Medical competence and supervision
  are available in nursing homes and should, therefore, be favourable preconditions
  for the implementation of preventive measures. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford
