abstract: Studies of climate change at specific intervals of future warming have primarily
  been addressed through top-down approaches using climate projections and modelled
  impacts. In contrast, bottom-up approaches focus on the recent past and present
  vulnerability. Here, we examine climate signals at different increments of warming
  and consider the need to reconcile top-down and bottom-up approaches. We synthesise
  insights from recent studies in three climate-sensitive systems where change is
  a defining feature of the human-environment system. Whilst top-down and bottom-up
  approaches generate complementary insights into who and what is at risk, integrating
  their results is a much-needed step towards developing relevant information to address
  the needs of immediate adaptation decisions.
