abstract: 'Background: There is growing interest in designing cities that support
  not only walking, but also cycling. Bike Score® is a metric capturing environmental
  characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and
  Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between
  and within-city variability in cycling behavior. Methods: We used linear regression
  to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share
  (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National
  Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. Results:
  At the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work
  cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation
  was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 % (95 % CI:
  0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful
  difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 %) in many North American cities.
  Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (>90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 % higher
  (β = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0-25). City specific
  analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates
  between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 %. Conclusions: The Bike
  Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting
  its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure.'
