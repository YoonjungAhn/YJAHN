abstract: Land plays a critical role in both economic and environmental accounting.
  As an asset, it occupies a unique position at the intersection of the System of
  National Accounts (SNA), the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Central
  Framework (SEEA-CF), and (as a spatial unit) SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting
  (SEEA-EEA), making land a natural starting point for developing natural capital
  accounts more generally. We develop a pilot set of national and subnational land
  accounts for the United States that are consistent with the SEEA-CF and SNA principles,
  quantified in both physical and monetary terms. The physical accounts utilize detailed
  land use (National Land Use Database) and land cover (National Land Cover Database)
  datasets, which provide insights into how land cover in the U.S. is changing over
  time. To provide aggregate estimates of land values, we use a hedonic approach that
  exploits fine-grain microdata (“big data” from Zillow) that contains detailed information
  from hundreds of millions of property transactions and their corresponding physical
  characteristics covering much of the U.S. Methodologically, we show that it is feasible
  to produce monetary accounts for land that can be directly linked to and integrated
  with physical land cover/use. Overall, U.S. land cover has shown declines in forests,
  cropland, and pasture with increases in barren, scrub/shrub, and developed classes,
  which are particularly concentrated in the U.S. Southeast. Nominal land values in
  the U.S. fell about 28% ($7 trillion) from the boom to bust periods in the prior
  decade, albeit with substantial regional variation, and have subsequently experienced
  a nearly full recovery in recent years. We estimate private land in the contiguous
  48 states to be worth approximately $25.1 trillion in 2016.
