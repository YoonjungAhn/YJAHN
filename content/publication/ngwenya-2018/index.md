abstract: Record breaking summer heat events are increasing in frequency in Zimbabwe
  and 2016 was a particularly hot year with the country experiencing its worst heat
  wave event in decades. Currently, Zimbabwe has no coordinated public health response
  to deal with heat wave events and no specific data on heat-related morbidity and
  mortality. The country has no legislation for protecting workers against environmental
  heat exposure, particularly those most vulnerable who are employed in the informal
  sector. These workers are also at risk due to their outdoor work environments. The
  study outlines the state of climate and heat stress in Zimbabwe as benchmarked against
  other African countries and France. It further summaries outdoor workers' susceptibility
  to heat exposure and the need for the Zimbabwean Government to develop policies
  to ensure the health and safety of an increasing population of outdoor workers in
  Zimbabwe.
