abstract: The case-crossover design was proposed for the study of a transient effect
  of an intermittent exposure on the subsequent occurrence of a rare acute-onset disease.
  This design can be an alternative to Poisson time series regression for studying
  the health effects of fine particulate matter air pollution. Characteristics of
  time-series of particulate matter, including long-term time trends, seasonal trends,
  and short-term autocorrelations, require that referent selection in the case-crossover
  design be considered carefully and adapted to minimize bias. We performed simulations
  to evaluate the bias associated with various referent selection strategies for a
  proposed case-crossover study of associations between particulate matter and primary
  cardiac arrest. Some a priori reasonable strategies were associated with a relative
  bias as large as 10%, but for most strategies the relative bias was less than 2%
  with confidence interval coverage within 1% of the nominal level. We show that referent
  selection for case-crossover designs raises the same issues as selection of smoothing
  method for time series analyses. In addition, conditional logistic regression analysis
  is not strictly valid for some case-crossover designs, introducing further bias.
