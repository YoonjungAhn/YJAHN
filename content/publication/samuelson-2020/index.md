abstract: Municipalities use Heat Vulnerability Indices (HVIs) to quantify and map
  relative distribution of risks to human health in the event of a heatwave. These
  maps ostensibly allow public agencies to identify the highest-risk neighborhoods,
  and to concentrate emergency planning efforts and resources accordingly (e.g., to
  establish the locations of cooling centers). The method of constructing an HVI varies
  by municipality, but common inputs include demographic variables such as age and
  income – and to some extent, metrics such as land cover. However, taking demographic
  data as a proxy for heat vulnerability may provide an incomplete or inaccurate assessment
  of risk. A critical limitation in HVIs may be a lack of focus on housing characteristics
  and how they mediate indoor heat exposure. To provide an objective assessment of
  this limitation, we first reviewed HVIs in the literature and those published or
  commissioned by municipalities. We subsequently verified that most of these HVIs
  excluded housing factors. Next, to scope the potential consequences, we used physics-based
  simulations of housing prototypes (46,000 housing permutations per city) to estimate
  the variation in indoor heat exposure within high-vulnerability neighborhoods in
  Boston and Phoenix. The results show that by excluding building-level determinants
  of exposure, HVIs fail to capture important components of heat vulnerability. Moreover,
  we demonstrate how these maps currently overlook important nuances regarding the
  impact of building age and air conditioning functionality. Finally, we discuss the
  challenges of implementing housing stock characteristics in HVIs and propose methods
  for overcoming these challenges.
