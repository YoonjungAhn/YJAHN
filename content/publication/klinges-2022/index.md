abstract: Microclimate models predict temperature and other meteorological variables
  at scales relevant to individual organisms. The broad application of microclimate
  models requires gridded macroclimatic variables as input. However, the spatial and
  temporal resolution of such inputs can be a limiting factor on the accuracy of microclimate
  predictions. Due to its fine resolution and accuracy, the ERA5 reanalysis dataset
  is emerging as the favoured resource for global historical weather and climate data
  and has great potential for aiding microclimate modelling. Here we describe mcera5,
  an R language package that provides convenient access to, and wrangling of, the
  ERA5 climate datasets for use in microclimate models. Through this package, we provide
  functions to query ERA5 data for desired spatial and temporal extents, to correct
  for spatial biases and process outputs for easy interpretation by ecologists, thereby
  allowing faster and more accurate microclimate predictions. By validating with empirical
  observations from multiple biomes globally, we demonstrate that the use of ERA5
  climate forcing via mcera5 improves the prediction accuracy of soil moisture, air
  temperature and relative humidity as compared to forcing with other globally available
  data and offers comparable performance when predicting soil temperatures. Through
  the provision of fine-resolution ERA5 data, the mcera5 package fits into an ecosystem
  of tools for modelling microclimate in a spatio-temporally explicit fashion, advancing
  our ability to efficiently predict microclimate for any place on Earth for the past,
  present or future. The package also provides convenient access to ERA5 datasets
  for a range of other applications.
