abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has impacted the world in ways not seen in
  generations. Initial evidence suggests one of the effects is crime rates, which
  appear to have fallen drastically in many communities around the world. We argue
  that the principal reason for the change is the government ordered stay-at-home
  orders, which impacted the routine activities of entire populations. Because these
  orders impacted countries, states, and communities at different times and in different
  ways, a naturally occurring, quasi-randomized control experiment has unfolded, allowing
  the testing of criminological theories as never before. Using new and traditional
  data sources made available as a result of the pandemic criminologists are equipped
  to study crime in society as never before. We encourage researchers to study specific
  types of crime, in a temporal fashion (following the stay-at-home orders), and placed-based.
  The results will reveal not only why, where, when, and to what extent crime changed,
  but also how to influence future crime reduction. The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020
  is unquestionably one of the most significant worldwide events in recent history,
  impacting culture, government operations, crime, economics , politics, and social
  interactions for the foreseeable future. One unique aspect of this crisis is the
  governmental response of issuing legal stay-at-home orders to attempt to slow the
  spread of the virus. While these orders varied, both in degree and timing, between
  countries and states, they generally began with strong encouragement for persons
  to isolate themselves voluntarily. As the magnitude of the crisis grew, American
