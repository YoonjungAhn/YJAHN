abstract: "OBJECTIVES Data on the health impacts of heatwaves in infants are limited,
  and this study aimed to examine how heatwaves affect hospital admissions in infants.\
  \   METHODS A quasi-Poisson generalized additive model was used to assess the effects
  of heatwaves on hospital admissions in infants from 1st January 2005 to 31st December
  2015 in Brisbane, Australia, using a series of heatwave definitions after controlling
  for possible confounders. A case-only analysis was conducted to examine the possible
  modification effects of personal and community characteristics on the heatwaves
  effects on infants' hospital admissions.   RESULTS There was no significant increase
  in infants' hospital admissions when heatwave intensity was defined as mean temperature
  ≥90th percentile or ≥95th percentile of the mean temperature across the study period.
  When heatwave intensity increased to ≥97th percentile, infants' hospital admissions
  increased significantly (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10), and this increase raised
  with the increase of heatwave duration. No modification effect of gender, indigenous
  status, or Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) level on heatwave effect was
  observed.   CONCLUSIONS Infants in Brisbane were sensitive to intense heatwaves,
  and future heat early warning system based on a local evidence-based heatwave definition
  is needed to protect infants from heatwave impacts. Community-based heatwave adaptation
  programs aiming at raising the awareness of the adverse health impacts of intense
  heatwaves among infants' caregivers may relieve the postnatal health care demand
  in infants."
