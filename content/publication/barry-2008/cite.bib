 abstract = {Mountain Weather and Climate is an all-encompassing textbook describing mountain weather and climate processes. Results from several major field programs have been incorporated into this edition, including the European Alpine Experiment, studies of air drainage in the western United States and experiments on air flow over low hills. There are many new figures and selected regional case studies including new material on central Asia, Tibet, Greenland, Antarctica, the Andes, New Zealand, the Alps and equatorial East Africa. Chapters examine topics from human bioclimatology, weather hazards and air pollution, to climate change in mountain regions. Beginning with historical aspects of mountain meteorology, the book deals with the latitudinal, altitudinal and topographic controls of meteorological elements, circulation systems related to orography, and the climatic characteristics of mountains. It is ideal for graduates and researchers in meteorology, climatology, ecology, forestry, glaciology and hydrology.},
