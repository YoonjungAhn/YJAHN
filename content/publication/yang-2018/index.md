abstract: ", and 2011. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information
  on the Nation's land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD
  and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation's land resources,
  the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD
  2016 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for
  production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001
  to 2016 at 2-3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted
  in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and
  pre-processing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source
  integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications;
  a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy;
  a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating
  land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling
  method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production.
  The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty World
  Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall agreement
  ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was
  achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the
  robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational
  mapping."
