abstract: The National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB), consisting of solar radiation
  and meteorological data over the United States and regions of the surrounding countries,
  is a publicly open dataset that has been created and disseminated during the last
  23 years. This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations,
  models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the NSRDB as well as improvements
  in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the NSRDB over the years.
  The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for
  each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy
  Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental
  Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow
  and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
  (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective
  analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance
  data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean
  percentage biases within 5% and 10% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct
  normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov
  or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years,
  the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry
  both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.
