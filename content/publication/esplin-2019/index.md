abstract: AbstractThe risks associated with extreme heat are increasing as heat waves
  become more frequent and severe across larger areas. As people begin to experience
  heat waves more often and in more places, how will individuals respond? Measuring
  experience with heat simply as exposure to extreme temperatures may not fully capture
  how people subjectively experience those temperatures or their varied impacts on
  human health. These impacts may also influence an individual’s response to heat
  and motivate risk-reduction behaviors. If subjectively experiencing negative health
  effects from extreme heat promotes protective actions, these effects could be used
  alongside temperature exposure to more accurately measure extreme heat experience
  and inform risk prevention and communication strategies according to local community
  needs. Using a multi-level regression model, this study analyzes geo-referenced
  national survey data to assess whether Americans’ exposure to extreme heat and experience
  with its health effects are ...
