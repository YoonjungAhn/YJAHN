abstract: Assessment of socio-environmental problems and the search for solutions
  often require intersecting geospatial data on environmental factors and human population
  densities. In the United States, Census data is the most common source for information
  on population. However, timely acquisition of such data at sufficient spatial resolution
  can be problematic, especially in cases where the analysis area spans urban-rural
  gradients. With this data release, we provide a 30-m resolution population estimate
  for the contiguous United States. The workflow dasymetrically distributes Census
  block level population estimates across all non-transportation impervious surfaces
  within each Census block. The methodology is updatable using the most recent Census
  data and remote sensing-based observations of impervious surface area. The dataset,
  known as the U.G.L.I (updatable gridded lightweight impervious) population dataset,
  compares favorably against other population data sources, and provides a useful
  balance between resolution and complexity.
