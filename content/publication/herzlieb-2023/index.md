abstract: Range prediction of electric vehicles requires knowledge of many parameters,
  including information about the vehicle environment. As an alternative to onboard
  measurement, external data sources (secondary data) can be used. The presented methods
  are suitable for estimating climatic data for vehicle application including urban
  areas and areas of complex topography. Compared to an inverse distance weighting
  approach for ambient temperature values, Kriging yields better overall accuracy
  especially for areas of complex topography, improving accuracy in urban regions,
  however, remains a challenge. An approach to improve accuracy in urban areas by
  considering local climate zones in the selection of secondary data sources produces
  mixed results.
