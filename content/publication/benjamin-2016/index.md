abstract: © 2016 American Meteorological Society.The Rapid Refresh (RAP) and High-Resolution
  Rapid Refresh (HRRR), both operational at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental
  Prediction (NCEP) use the Thompson et al. mixed-phase bulk cloud microphysics scheme.
  This scheme permits predicted surface precipitation to simultaneously consist of
  rain, snow, and graupel at the same location under certain conditions. Here, the
  explicit precipitation-type diagnostic method is described as used in conjunction
  with the Thompson et al. scheme in the RAP and HRRR models. The postprocessing logic
  combines the explicitly predicted multispecies hydrometeor data and other information
  from the model forecasts to produce fields of surface precipitation type that distinguish
  between rain and freezing rain, and to also portray areas of mixed precipitation.
  This explicit precipitation-type diagnostic method is used with the NOAA operational
  RAP and HRRR models. Verification from two winter seasons from 2013 to 2015 is provided
  against METAR surface observations. An example of this product from a January 2015
  south-central United States winter storm is also shown.
