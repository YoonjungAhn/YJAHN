abstract: The proportion of a country's population living in urban areas is highly
  correlated with its level of income. Urban areas offer economies of scale and richer
  market structures, and there is strong evidence that workers in urban areas are
  individually more productive, and earn more, than rural workers. However, rapid
  urbanization is also associated with crowding, environmental degradation, and other
  impediments to productivity. Overall, we find no evidence that the level of urbanization
  affects the rate of economic growth. Our findings weaken the rationale for either
  encouraging or discouraging urbanization as part of a strategy for economic growth.
