abstract: '<p>The number of surface observations from nonstandardized networks across
  the United States has appreciably increased the last several years. Automated Weather
  Services, Inc. (AWS), maintains one example of this type of network offering nonstandardized
  observations for ∼8000 sites. The present study assesses the utility of such a network
  to improve short-term (i.e., lead times &amp;lt;12 h) National Digital Forecast
  Database (NDFD) forecasts for three parameters most relevant to the energy industry—temperature,
  dewpoint, and wind speed. A 1-yr sample of 13 AWS sites is chosen to evaluate the
  magnitude of forecast improvement (skill) and influence of physical location (siting)
  on such improvements. Hourly predictions are generated using generalized additive
  modeling (GAM)—a nonlinear statistical equation incorporating a predetermined set
  of the most significant AWS and NDFD predictors. Two references are used for comparison:
  (i) persistence climatology (PC) forecasts and (ii) NDFD forecasts calibrated to
  the AWS sites (CNDFD). The skill, measured via the percent improvement (reduction)
  in the mean absolute error (MAE), of forecasts generated by the study’s technique
  (CNDFD+) is comparable (&amp;lt;5%) to PC for lead times of 1–3 h for dewpoint and
  wind speed. Skill relative to PC slowly increases with lead time, with temperature
  exhibiting the greatest relative-to-PC skill (∼30% at 12 h). When compared to baseline
  CNDFD forecasts, the MAE of the generated CNDFD+ forecasts is reduced 65% for temperature
  and dewpoint at the 1-h lead time. An exponential drop in improvement occurs for
  longer lead times. Wind speed improvements are notably less, with little skill (&amp;lt;5%)
  demonstrated for forecasts beyond 4 h. Overall, CNDFD+ forecasts have the greatest
  accuracy relative to CNDFD and PC for the middle (3–7 h) lead times tested in the
  study. Variations in CNDFD+ skill exist with respect to AWS location. Tested stations
  located in complex terrain generally exhibit greater skill relative to CNDFD than
  the 13-station average for temperature (and, to a lesser degree, dewpoint). Relative
  to PC, however, the same subset of stations exhibits skill below the 13-station
  average. No conclusive relationship can be made between CNDFD+ skill and the sample
  stations located near water.</p>'
