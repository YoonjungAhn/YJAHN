abstract: 'The objectives of the present study are to: (i) evaluate the effect of
  environmental and metabolic heat on heat-related illnesses in outdoor workers; and
  (ii) evaluate the effect of personal factors, including heat acclimation, on the
  risk of heat-related illnesses in outdoor workers. We identified 47 cases of illnesses
  from exposure to environmental heat in outdoor workers in Korea from 2010 to 2014,
  based on review of workers’ compensation data. We also obtained the information
  on location, time, and work environment of each heat-related illness. Our major
  results are that 29 cases (61.7%) occurred during a heat wave. Forty five cases
  (95.7%) occurred when the maximum estimated WBGT (WBGTmax) was equal to or greater
  than the case specific threshold value which was determined by acclimatization and
  metabolic rate. Twenty two cases (46.8%) were not acclimated to the heat. Thirty-seven
  cases (78.7%) occurred after tropical night (temperature above 25 °C), during which
  many people may find it hard to sleep. Personal risk factors such as heat acclimation
  as well as environmental factors and high metabolic rate during work are the major
  determinants of heat-related illnesses.'
