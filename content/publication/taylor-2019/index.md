abstract: In the United Kingdom, the Met Office issues regionally calibrated impact-based
  weather warnings. These aim to reduce harm to people and property. To decrease risk
  from severe weather, it is important to understand how members of the U.K. public
  interpret and act on these warnings. This paper addresses this through a postevent
  survey (n = 552) conducted following Storm Doris, a 2017 winter storm during which
  wind warnings were issued across much of the United Kingdom. Survey questions examined
  1) understanding of impact-based wind warnings, 2) interpretation of local warning
  level, 3) predictors of perceived local risk (likelihood, impact severity, concern)
  implied by warnings, 4) predictors of trust in the forecast, and 5) predictors of
  recalled and anticipated action. Our findings indicate that U.K. residents generally
  understand that weather warnings are based on potential weather impacts, although
  many do not realize warnings are regionally calibrated. We also find that while
  local warning levels are rarely underestimated, they may sometimes be overestimated.
  Institutional trust in the Met Office and perceived vulnerability to weather predict
  both perceived risk and behavioral response, while warning ‘‘understandability’’
  is linked to greater trust in the forecast. Strikingly, while differences in local
  warning levels influenced risk perception, they did not affect recalled or intended
  behavioral response. This study highlights the importance of institutional trust
  in the effective communication of severe weather warnings, and a need for education
  on impact-based weather warnings. Above all, it demonstrates the need for further
  exploration of the effect of weather warnings on protective behavior.
