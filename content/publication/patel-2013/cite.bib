 abstract = {Environmental heat illness and injuries are a serious concern for the Army and Marines. Currently, the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index is used to evaluate heat injury risk. The index is a weighted average of dry-bulb temperature (T db), black globe temperature (T bg), and natural wet-bulb temperature (T nwb). The WBGT index would be more widely used if it could be determined using standard weather instruments. This study compares models developed by Liljegren at Argonne National Laboratory and by Matthew at the U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine that calculate WBGT using standard meteorological measurements. Both models use air temperature (T a), relative humidity, wind speed, and global solar radiation (R G) to calculate T nwb and T bg. The WBGT and meteorological data used for model validation were collected at Griffin, Georgia and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG), Arizona. Liljegren (YPG: R 2 = 0.709, p < 0.01; Griffin: R 2 = 0.854, p < 0.01) showed closer agreement between calculated and actual WBGT than Matthew (YPG: R 2 = 0.630, p < 0.01; Griffin: R 2 = 0.677, p < 0.01). Compared to actual WBGT heat categorization, the Matthew model tended to underpredict compared to Liljegren's classification. Results indicate Liljegren is an acceptable alternative to direct WBGT measurement, but verification under other environmental conditions is needed. INTRODUCTION Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are serious concerns for military organizations. In the U.S. military in 2011, a total of 2,652 cases of heat exhaustion, an incident rate of 1.82 per 1,000 person-years, were reported. 1 Preventing casualties is a command responsibility during mission planning and execution in warm and hot environments or during hard work in cooler weather. Heat indices that provide estimates of injury risk because of physical activity and heat exposure are commonly used to assess and reduce the risk of heat causalities. 2-5 At present, the U.S. military uses the Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) heat stress index to guide work/rest and hydration practices and reduce the risk of heat illness and injury. 2 However, accurate and timely WBGT information needed to make informed decisions is often not readily available because of the cost and overhead of WBGT sensor systems, including recalibration of electronic monitors and the need to regularly replenish the wet-bulb thermometer's H 2 O reservoir. Fortunately, mathematical models have been developed that estimate WBGT from standard weather measurements, i.e., air temperature (T a), air velocity, radiant load (e.g., direct, diffuse, or reflected solar radiation), and humidity.},
