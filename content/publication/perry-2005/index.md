abstract: Monthly or annual 5 km × 5 km gridded datasets covering the UK are generated
  for the 1961-2000 period, for 36 climatic parameters. As well as the usual elements
  of temperature, rainfall, sunshine, cloud, wind speed, and pressure, derived temperature
  variables (such as growing-season length, heating degree days, and heat and cold
  wave durations) and further precipitation variables (such as rainfall intensity,
  maximum consecutive dry days, and days of snow, hail and thunder) are analysed.
  The analysis process uses geographical information system capabilities to combine
  multiple regression with inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. Geographic and
  topographic factors, such as easting and northing, terrain height and shape, and
  urban and coastal effects, are incorporated either through normalization with regard
  to the 1961-90 average climate, or as independent variables in the regression. Local
  variations are then incorporated through the spatial interpolation of regression
  residuals. For each of the climatic parameters, the choice of model is based on
  verification statistics produced by excluding a random set of stations from the
  analysis for a selection of months, and comparing the observed values with the estimated
  values at each point. This gives some insight into the significance, direction,
  and seasonality of factors affecting different climate elements. It also gives a
  measure of the accuracy of the method at predicting values between station locations.
  The datasets are being used for the verification of climate modelling scenarios
  and are available via the Internet. © Crown Copyright 2005. Reproduced with the
