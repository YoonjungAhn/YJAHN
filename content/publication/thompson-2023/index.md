abstract: Heatwaves are becoming more frequent under climate change and can lead to
  thousands of excess deaths. Adaptation to extreme weather events often occurs in
  response to an event, with communities learning fast following unexpectedly impactful
  events. Using extreme value statistics, here we show where regional temperature
  records are statistically likely to be exceeded, and therefore communities might
  be more at-risk. In 31% of regions examined, the observed daily maximum temperature
  record is exceptional. Climate models suggest that similar behaviour can occur in
  any region. In some regions, such as Afghanistan and parts of Central America, this
  is a particular problem - not only have they the potential for far more extreme
  heatwaves than experienced, but their population is growing and increasingly exposed
  because of limited healthcare and energy resources. We urge policy makers in vulnerable
  regions to consider if heat action plans are sufficient for what might come. The
  global risk of record-breaking heatwaves is assessed, with the most at-risk regions
  identified. It is shown that record-smashing events that currently appear implausible
  could happen anywhere as a result of climate change.
