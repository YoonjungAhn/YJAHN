abstract: "The recent release of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project
  (ISCCP) HXG cloud products and new ERA5 reanalysis data enabled us to produce a
  global surface solar radiation (SSR) dataset: a 16-year (2000-2015) high-resolution
  (3 h, 10 km) global SSR dataset using an improved physical parameterization scheme.
  The main inputs were cloud optical depth from ISCCP-HXG cloud products; the water
  vapor, surface pressure and ozone from ERA5 reanalysis data; and albedo and aerosol
  from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The estimated
  SSR data were evaluated against surface observations measured at 42 stations of
  the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and 90 radiation stations of the China
  Meteorological Administration (CMA). Validation against the BSRN data indicated
  that the mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient
  (R) for the instantaneous SSR estimates at 10 km scale were -11.5 W m-2, 113.5 W
  m-2 and 0.92, respectively. When the estimated instantaneous SSR data were upscaled
  to 90 km, its error was clearly reduced, with RMSE decreasing to 93.4 W m-2 and
  R increasing to 0.95. For daily SSR estimates at 90 km scale, the MBE, RMSE and
  R at the BSRN were -5.8 W m-2, 33.1 W m-2 and 0.95, respectively. These error metrics
  at the CMA radiation stations were 2.1 W m-2, 26.9 W m-2 and 0.95, respectively.
  Comparisons with other global satellite radiation products indicated that our SSR
  estimates were generally better than those of the ISCCP flux dataset (ISCCP-FD),
  the global energy and water cycle experiment surface radiation budget (GEWEX-SRB),
  and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES). Our SSR dataset will contribute to
  the land-surface process simulations and the photovoltaic applications in the future.
