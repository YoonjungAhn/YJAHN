abstract: Adaptation to increasing extreme heat in a changing climate requires a precise
  understanding of who is most vulnerable to the health effects of extreme heat. The
  evidence for race, ethnicity, income, education , and occupation at both the individual
  and area levels as indicators of vulnerability is reviewed. The evidence for the
  social, behavioral, and technological mechanisms by which racial and socioeconomic
  disparities in vulnerability exist is also reviewed. These characteristics include
  cardiorespiratory, renal and endocrine comorbidities; cognitive, mental, or physical
  disabilities; medication use; housing characteristics; neighborhood characteristics
  such as urban heat islands, crime, and safety; social isolation; and individual
  behaviors such as air conditioning use, opening windows, using fans, and use of
  cooler public spaces. Pre-existing and future research identifying these more proximal
  indicators of vulnerability will provide information that is more gen-eralizable
  across locations and time to aid in identifying who to target for prevention of
  heat-associated morbidity and mortality.
