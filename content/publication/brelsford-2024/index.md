abstract: In this Data Descriptor, we present county-level electricity outage estimates
  at 15-minute intervals from 2014 to 2022. By 2022 92% of customers in the 50 US
  States, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico are represented. These data have been produced
  by the Environment for Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-ITM), a
  geographic information system and data visualization platform created at Oak Ridge
  National Laboratory to map the population experiencing electricity outages every
  15 minutes at the county level. Although these data do not cover every US customer,
  they represent the most comprehensive outage information ever compiled for the United
  States. The rate of coverage increases through time between 2014 and 2022. We present
  a quantitative Data Quality Index for these data for the years 2018–2022 to demonstrate
  temporal changes in customer coverage rates by FEMA region and indicators of data
  collection gaps or other errors.
