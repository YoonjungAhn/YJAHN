abstract: 'This paper presents the applications of Kriging spatial interpolation methods
  for meteorologic variables, including temperature and relative humidity, in regions
  of Vietnam. Three types of interpolation methods are used, which are as follows:
  Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, and Universal Kriging plus Digital Elevation
  model correction. The input meteorologic data was collected from 98 ground weather
  stations throughout Vietnam and the outputs were interpolated temperature and relative
  humidity gridded fields, along with their error maps. The experimental results showed
  that Universal Kriging plus the digital elevation model correction method outperformed
  the two other methods when applied to temperature. The interpolation effectiveness
  of Ordinary Kriging and Universal Kriging were almost the same when applied to both
  temperature and relative humidity.'
