 abstract = {This paper presents the applications of Kriging spatial interpolation methods for meteorologic variables, including temperature and relative humidity, in regions of Vietnam. Three types of interpolation methods are used, which are as follows: Ordinary Kriging, Universal Kriging, and Universal Kriging plus Digital Elevation model correction. The input meteorologic data was collected from 98 ground weather stations throughout Vietnam and the outputs were interpolated temperature and relative humidity gridded fields, along with their error maps. The experimental results showed that Universal Kriging plus the digital elevation model correction method outperformed the two other methods when applied to temperature. The interpolation effectiveness of Ordinary Kriging and Universal Kriging were almost the same when applied to both temperature and relative humidity.},
