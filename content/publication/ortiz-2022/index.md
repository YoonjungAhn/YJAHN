abstract: Global climate change has increased the need for cooling indoor spaces,
  leading to a rise in adoption of air conditioning. This adoption, while decreasing
  health risks, can increase energy use and pose economic burdens in low income households.
  Here, we estimate the burden associated with cooling, as well as potential extreme
  heat exposure without it in the largest city in the US, New York using a coupled
  weather and building energy model, utility pay scales, and household income data
  from the US Census.Results show uneven distribution of AC economic burden, with
  lower income neighborhoods experiencing the largest relative costs. High-burden
  neighborhoods see the largest climate-driven increases in spite of lower enthalpy
  increases. These neighborhoods also have the most exposure to indoor extreme heat,
  which may triple by end of century. Energy burden may pose a barrier to AC operation,
  with estimated cost in the lowest income households reaching up to 6.1% of income
  for a 100 m2 dwelling, which could increase to 8% by end of century. We also explore
  adaptation strategies and quantify their impacts, finding that modifying traditional
  set points and reflective roofs can reduce energy burden significantly, by up to
  20% in the highest burden neighborhoods.
