abstract: 'Most extreme heat studies relate outdoor weather conditions to human morbidity
  and mortality. In developed nations, individuals spend ~90% of their time indoors.
  This pilot study investigated the indoor environments of people receiving emergency
  medical care in New York City, NY, U.S., from July to August 2013. The first objective
  was to determine the relative influence of outdoor conditions as well as patient
  characteristics and neighborhood sociodemographics on indoor temperature and specific
  humidity (N = 764). The second objective was to determine whether cardiovascular
  or respiratory cases experience hotter and more humid indoor conditions as compared
  to controls. Paramedics carried portable sensors into buildings where patients received
  care to passively monitor indoor temperature and humidity. The case–control study
  compared 338 respiratory cases, 291 cardiovascular cases, and 471 controls. Intuitively,
  warmer and sunnier outdoor conditions increased indoor temperatures. Older patients
  who received emergency care tended to occupy warmer buildings. Indoor-specific humidity
  levels quickly adjusted to outdoor conditions. Indoor heat and humidity exposure
  above a 26 °C threshold increased (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.98–2.68, P = 0.056), but
  not significantly, the proportion of respiratory cases. Indoor heat exposures were
  similar between cardiovascular cases and controls.'
