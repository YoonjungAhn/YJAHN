abstract: 'Introduction: Spending a few hours to cool down in a cooling center reduces
  the impact of heat on health. But limited or lack of accessibility of these facilities
  is often a barrier to their utilization. The objective of this study was to assess
  accessibility of the cooling centers to heat-vulnerable populations in New York
  State (NYS) by various modes of transportation. Methods: We estimate the proximity
  of 377 cooling centers to general and heat-vulnerable populations in NYS (excluding
  New York City (NYC)) and determine their accessibility via walking, public transportation
  and driving. Distances between tract populations and nearest cooling center, and
  between cooling centers and public transportation stops were estimated. Accessibility
  in four metropolitan regions was determined via public transportation while accessibility
  in heat-vulnerable rural areas was estimated via driving. Results: Distances to
  nearest cooling center ranged from 0 to 53.2 miles with only a third of NYS population
  within walking distance (0.5 miles) of a cooling center. About 51% of heat-vulnerable
  tracts were within 0.5 miles, with an average distance of 2.4 miles to the nearest
  cooling center. Within the four metro politan regions 80% of cooling centers within
  0.5 miles of a public transportation stop. All cooling centers in heat-vulnerable
  tracts were accessible via public transportation. In rural heat-vulnerable tracts,
  driving distances averaged at about 18 miles. Conclusions: In urban areas many residents
  were not within walking distance of a cooling center, but most, and nearly all in
  the most heat-vulnerable areas, were within walking distance of public transportation
  to a cooling center. In rural locations distances were longer, and accessibility
  is a greater issue. Cooling centers can be a valuable resource for general and heat-vulnerable
  populations during an extreme heat event. When planning and implementing cooling
  centers, it is therefore important to improve accessibility and address other barriers
  that can hamper their utilization.'
