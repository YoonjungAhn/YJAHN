abstract: ' Due to climate change and rapid urbanization, Urban Heat Island (UHI),
  featuring significantly higher temperature in metropolitan areas than surrounding
  areas, has caused negative impacts on urban communities. Temporal granularity is
  often limited in UHI studies based on satellite remote sensing data that typically
  has multi-day frequency coverage of a particular urban area. This low temporal frequency
  has restricted the development of models for predicting UHI. To resolve this limitation,
  this study has developed a cyber-based geographic information science and systems
  (cyberGIS) framework encompassing multiple machine learning models for predicting
  UHI with high-frequency urban sensor network data combined with remote sensing data
  focused on Chicago, Illinois, from 2018 to 2020. Enabled by rapid advances in urban
  sensor network technologies and high-performance computing, this framework is designed
  to predict UHI in Chicago with fine spatiotemporal granularity based on environmental
  data collected with the Array of Things (AoT) urban sensor network and Landsat-8
  remote sensing imagery. Our computational experiments revealed that a random forest
  regression (RFR) model outperforms other models with the prediction accuracy of
  0.45 degree Celsius in 2020 and 0.8 degree Celsius in 2018 and 2019 with mean absolute
  error as the evaluation metric. Humidity, distance to geographic center, and PM
  2.5 concentration are identified as important factors contributing to the model
  performance. Furthermore, we estimate UHI in Chicago with 10-min temporal frequency
  and 1-km spatial resolution on the hottest day in 2018. It is demonstrated that
  the RFR model can accurately predict UHI at fine spatiotemporal scales with high-frequency
  urban sensor network data integrated with satellite remote sensing data. '
