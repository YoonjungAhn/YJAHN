abstract: The increasing number and severity of wildfires is negatively impacting
  air quality for millions of California residents each year. Community exposure to
  PM2.5 in two main population centers (San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles County
  area) was assessed using the low-cost PurpleAir sensor network for the record-setting
  2020 California wildfire season. Estimated PM2.5 concentrations in each study area
  were compared to census tract-level environmental justice vulnerability indicators,
  including environmental, health, and demographic data. Higher PM2.5 concentrations
  were positively correlated with poverty, cardiovascular emergency department visits,
  and housing inequities. Sensors within 30 km of actively burning wildfires showed
  statistically significant increases in indoor (~800 %) and outdoor (~540 %) PM2.5
  during the fires. Results indicate that wildfire emissions may exacerbate existing
  health disparities as well as the burden of pollution in disadvantaged communities,
  suggesting a need to improve monitoring and adaptive capacity among vulnerable populations.
