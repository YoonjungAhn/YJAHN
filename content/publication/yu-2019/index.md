abstract: Comparable estimates of the heat-related work productivity loss (WPL) in
  different countries over the world are difficult partly due to the lack of exact
  measures and comparable data for different counties. In this study, we analysed
  4363 responses to a global online survey on the WPL during heat waves in 2016. The
  participants were from both developed and developing countries, facilitating estimates
  of the heat-related WPL across the world for the year. The heat-related WPL for
  each country involved was then deduced for increases of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C in the
  global mean surface temperature under the representative concentration pathway scenarios
  in climate models. The average heat-related WPL in 2016 was 6.6 days for developing
  countries and 3.5 days for developed countries. The estimated heat-related WPL was
  negatively correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. When global surface
  temperatures increased by 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C, the corresponding WPL was 9 (19),
  12 (31), 22 (61) and 33 (94) days for developed (developing) countries, quantifying
  how developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change from a particular
  point of view. Moreover, the heat-related WPL was unevenly distributed among developing
  countries. In a 2°C-warmer world, the heat-related WPL would be more than two months
  in Southeast Asia, the most influenced region. The results are considerable for
  developing strategy of adaptation especially for developing countries.
