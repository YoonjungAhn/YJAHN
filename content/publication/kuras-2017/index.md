abstract: 'Background: Environmental heat exposure is a public health concern. The
  impacts of environmental heat on mortality and morbidity at the population scale
  are well documented, but little is known about specific exposures that individuals
  experience. Objectives: The first objective of this work was to catalyze discussion
  of the role of personal heat exposure information in research and risk assessment.
  The second objective was to provide guidance regarding the operationalization of
  personal heat exposure research methods. Discussion: We define personal heat exposure
  as realized contact between a person and an indoor or outdoor environment that poses
  a risk of increases in body core temperature and/or perceived discomfort. Personal
  heat exposure can be measured directly with wearable monitors or estimated indirectly
  through the combination of time-activity and meteorological data sets. Complementary
  information to understand individual-scale drivers of behavior, susceptibility,
  and health and comfort outcomes can be collected from additional monitors, surveys,
  interviews, ethnographic approaches, and additional social and health data sets.
  Personal exposure research can help reveal the extent of exposure misclassification
  that occurs when individual exposure to heat is estimated using ambient temperature
  measured at fixed sites and can provide insights for epidemiological risk assessment
  concerning extreme heat. Conclusions: Personal heat exposure research provides more
  valid and precise insights into how often people encounter heat conditions and when,
  where, to whom, and why these encounters occur. Published literature on personal
  heat exposure is limited to date, but existing studies point to opportunities to
  inform public health practice regarding extreme heat, particularly where fine-scale
  precision is needed to reduce health consequences of heat exposure.'
