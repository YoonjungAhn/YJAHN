abstract: 'Background: Extreme heat is an important public health risk. Climate change
  will likely increase the temperatures humans are exposed to through exacerbated
  heat wave intensity and frequency, possibly increasing health risks from heat. To
  prevent adverse effects on human health, heat prevention plans and climate change
  adaptation strategies are being implemented. But are these measures effectively
  reducing heat-related mortality and morbidity? This study assesses the evidence
  base in 2014. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed published
  literature. We applied a combined search strategy of automated search and journal
  content search using the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Biological
  Abstracts, CAB Abstracts and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses A&I. Quality appraisal
  was conducted using CASP checklists, and we identified recurrent themes in studies
  with content analysis methodology. We conducted sub-group analyses for two types
  of studies: survey and interview research on behavioral change and perception, and
  observational studies with regression. Results: 30 articles were included in the
  review. The majority of studies (n = 17) assessed mortality or morbidity reductions
  with regression analysis. Overall, the assessments report a reduction of adverse
  effects during extreme heat in places where preventive measures have been implemented.
  Population perception and behavior change were assessed in five studies, none of
  which had carried out a pre-test. Two themes emerged from the review: methodological
  challenges are a major hindrance to rigorous evaluation, and what counts as proof
  of an effective reduction in adverse health outcomes is disputed. Conclusions: Attributing
  health outcomes to heat adaptation remains a challenge. Recent study designs are
  less rigorous due to difficulties assigning the counterfactual. While sensitivity
  to heat is decreasing, the examined studies provide inconclusive evidence on individual
  planned adaptation measures.'
