abstract: Whether a community is in the path of a natural disaster, the target of
  an act of terror, or simply striving to meet the demands of increasingly dense urban
  populations, a community resilience paradigm can help communities and individuals
  not just to mitigate damage and heal, but to thrive. This article discusses experiences
  from recent, large-scale disasters to explore how community resilience might serve
  as a sustainable paradigm for organizing public health and medical preparedness,
  response, and recovery. By strengthening health systems, meeting the needs of vulnerable
  populations, and promoting organizational competence, social connectedness, and
  psychological health, community resilience encourages actions that build preparedness,
  promote strong day-to-day systems, and address the underlying social determinants
  of health. Thus, community resilience resonates with a wide array of stakeholders,
  particularly those whose work routinely addresses health, wellness, or societal
  well-being.
