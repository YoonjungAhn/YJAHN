abstract: The frequency of extreme heat events, such as the summer of 2003 in Europe,
  and their corresponding consequences for human beings are expected to increase under
  a warmer climate. The joint collaboration of institutional agencies and multidisciplinary
  approaches is essential for a successful development of heat-health warning systems
  and action plans which can reduce the impacts of extreme heat on the population.
  The present work constitutes a state-of-the-art review of 16 European heat-health
  warning systems and heat-health action plans, based on the existing literature,
  web search (over the National Meteorological Services websites) and questionnaires.
  The aim of this study is to pave the way for future heat-health warning systems,
  such as the one currently under development in the framework of the Horizon 2020
  HEAT-SHIELD project. Some aspects are highlighted among the variety of examined
  European warning systems. The meteorological variables that trigger the warnings
  should present a clear link with the impact under consideration and should be chosen
  depending on the purpose and target of the warnings. Setting long-term planning
  actions as well as pre-alert levels might prevent and reduce damages due to heat.
  Finally, education and communication are key elements of the success of a warning
  system.
