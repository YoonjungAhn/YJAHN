abstract: Previous studies have cataloged social disparities in air pollution exposure
  in US public schools with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. These
  studies rely upon chronic, averaged measures of air pollution, which fosters a static
  conception of exposure disparities. This paper examines PM2.5 exposure disparities
  in Salt Lake County (SLC), Utah public schools under three different PM2.5 scenarios—relatively
  clean air, a moderate winter persistent cold air pool (PCAP), and a major winter
  PCAP—with respect to race/ethnicity, economic deprivation, student age, and school
  type. We pair demographic data for SLC schools (n = 174) with modelled PM2.5 values,
  obtained from a distributed network of sensors placed through a community-university
  partnership. Results from generalized estimating equations controlling for school
  district clustering and other covariates reveal that patterns of social inequality
  vary under different PM2.5 pollution scenarios. Charter schools and schools serving
  economically deprived students experienced disproportionate exposure during relatively
  clean air and moderate PM2.5 PCAP conditions, but those inequalities attenuated
  under major PCAP conditions. Schools with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority
  students were unequally exposed under all PM2.5 pollution scenarios, reflecting
  the robustness of racial/ethnic disparities in exposure. The findings speak to the
  need for policy changes to protect school-aged children from environmental harm
  in SLC and elsewhere.
