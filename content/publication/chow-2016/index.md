abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the geographic
  disparity of geocoding error among different geocoding solutions. The research questions
  include: (1) What are the positional accuracies and matching rates of various geocoding
  techniques? (2) Are there any significant differences of geocoding quality in rural
  and urban areas? In this study, 1100 residential addresses scattered across Texas,
  USA, were address-matched using eight different geocoding platforms, including the
  ESRI ArcGIS Address Locator, CoreLogic PxPoint, Google Maps API, Yahoo! PlaceFinder,
  Microsoft Bing, Geocoder.us, Texas A&M University Geocoder, and OpenStreetMap (OSM).
  The geocoded locations for each method were validated against the GPS data and manual
  digitization. Using GPS data as reference data, the desktop geocoding using parcel
  data achieved the highest positional accuracy with a mean error of 24.8 m, whereas
  the Google Maps API was the best among the six Internet solutions with a mean error
  of 31.7 m. All geocoding solutions, except Geocoder.us and OSM, achieved a matching
  rate >95%. It is important to note, however, that the OSM geocoding revealed decent
  positional accuracy in terms of median and 5% trimmed mean errors, indicating the
  potential of crowdsourcing approach to produce an accurate geospatial data set.
  The geocoding errors between urban and rural areas were significantly different
  in most geocoding solutions but there was no consistent and monotonic trend. Excluding
  the errors of outliers, defined as the lowest 5 percentile, indeed changed the direction
  of urban versus rural accuracy in OSM, PxPoint, and ArcGIS geocoding.'
