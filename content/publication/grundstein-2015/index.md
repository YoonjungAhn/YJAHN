abstract: 'Exertional heat illnesses affect thousands of athletes each year across
  the United States (U.S.). Heat safety guidelines such as those developed by the
  American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) are widely used to direct activities
  based on environmental conditions but rely on a uniform set of heat safety categories.
  Due to geographic variations in heat exposure and acclimatization, however, lower
  heat safety thresholds may be needed in areas with cooler climates. Our study addresses
  this shortcoming by developing regional guidelines for athletic activity that use
  relative thresholds of a commonly used heat metric -- the wet bulb globe temperature
  (WBGT). We employed a unique WBGT climatology for the contiguous U.S. to determine
  locally extreme WBGTs, defined as the 90th percentile warm season daily maximum
  value, for 217 stations. Three heat safety regions were identified based on local
  extremes: Category 3 (WBGTs≥32.3°C), Category 2 (30.1-32.2°C), and Category 1 (≤30°C).
  Geographically, Category 3 encompasses much of the southeastern quadrant of the
  U.S. along with portions of the Southwest, and the Central Valley of California;
  Category 2 areas extend in an arc from the interior Northwest through Nevada and
  portions of the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast; and Category 1 locations include
  the Pacific Coast, New England, and the northern tier of the country. Associated
  regional activity guidelines based on those developed by the ACSM and the Georgia
  High School Association (GHSA) were developed for each heat safety region.'
