 abstract = {An equation is presented for wet-bulb temperature as a function of air temperature and relative humidity at standard sea level pressure. It was found as an empirical fit using gene-expression programming. This equation is valid for relative humidities between 5% and 99% and for air temperatures between -20° and 50°C, except for situations having both low humidity and cold temperature. Over the valid range, errors in wet-bulb temperature range from 21° to +0.65°C, with mean absolute error of less than 0.3°C. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},
