abstract: An equation is presented for wet-bulb temperature as a function of air temperature
  and relative humidity at standard sea level pressure. It was found as an empirical
  fit using gene-expression programming. This equation is valid for relative humidities
  between 5% and 99% and for air temperatures between -20° and 50°C, except for situations
  having both low humidity and cold temperature. Over the valid range, errors in wet-bulb
  temperature range from 21° to +0.65°C, with mean absolute error of less than 0.3°C.
