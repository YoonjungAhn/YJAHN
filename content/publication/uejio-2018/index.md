abstract: "PURPOSE: Outdoor workers face elevated and prolonged heat exposures and
  have limited access to air-conditioned spaces. This study's overarching research
  aim is to increase knowledge of municipal worker heat exposure and adaptation practices.
  The study's sub-objectives are: (1) quantifying exposure misclassification from
  estimating personal heat exposure from the official weather station; (2) surveying
  worker's knowledge and practices to adapt to extreme heat; and (3) relating heat
  exposure and adaptation practices to self-reported thermal comfort., METHODS: Participants
  wore a personal heat exposure sensor over 7 days from June 1st to July 3rd, 2015
  in Tallahassee, Florida US. Next, participants confirmed the days that they wore
  the sensor and reported their daily thermal comfort and heat adaptations. Finally,
  participants completed an extreme heat knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey.,
  RESULTS: Some participants (37%) experienced hotter and more humid conditions (heat
  index > 2) than the weather station. The most common heat adaptations were staying
  hydrated (85%), wearing a hat (46%), and seeking shade (40%). During work hours,
  higher temperatures increased the odds (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval:
  1.03-1.41, p = 0.016) of a participant feeling too hot. Shifting work duty indoors
  made workers to feel more comfortable (odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval:
  0.11-0.70, p = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: In hot and humid climates, everyday, heat exposures
  continuously challenge the health of outdoor workers."
