abstract: 'Introduction: There is an increasing interest in understanding whether
  air pollutants modify the quantitative relationships between temperature and health
  outcomes. The results of available studies were, however, inconsistent. This study
  aims to sum up the current evidence and provide a comprehensive understanding of
  this topic. Methods: We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE,
  Web of Science Core Collection, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The modified
  Navigation Guide was applied to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence. We
  calculated pooled temperature-related mortality at low and high pollutant levels
  respectively, using the random-effects model. Results: We identified 22 eligible
  studies, eleven of which were included in the meta-analysis. Significant effect
  modification was observed on heat effects for all-cause and non-accidental mortality
  by particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 Î¼m (PM10) and ozone (O3)
  (p < 0.05). The excess risks (ERs) for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were
  5.4% (4.4%, 6.4%) and 6.3% (4.8%, 7.8%) at the low PM10 level, 8.8% (7.5%, 10.1%)
  and 11.4% (8.7%, 14.2%) at the high PM10 level, respectively. As for O3, the ERs
  for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.1% (3.9%, 6.3%) and 3.6% (0.1%,
  7.2%) at the low O3 level, 7.6% (6.3%, 9.0%) and 12.5% (4.7%, 20.9%) at the high
  O3 level, respectively. Surprisingly, the heat effects on cardiovascular mortality
  were found to be lower at high carbon monoxide (CO) levels [ERs = 5.4% (3.9%, 6.9%)]
  than that at low levels [ERs = 9.4% (7.0%, 11.9%)]. The heterogeneity varied, but
  the results of sensitivity analyses were generally robust. Significant effect modification
  by air pollutants was not observed for heatwave or cold effects. Conclusions: PM10
  and O3 modify the heat-related all-cause and non-accidental mortality, indicating
  that policymakers should consider air pollutants when establishing heat-health warning
  systems. Future studies with comparable designs and settings are needed.'
