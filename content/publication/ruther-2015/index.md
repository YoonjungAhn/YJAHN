abstract: Comparability among population data enumerated within different time periods
  may be complicated by changing enumeration boundaries over time. Areal interpolation
  methods are commonly used to solve such zoning incompatibilities, but are frequently
  based on the questionable assumption of homogeneous population density within the
  different zones. To achieve more accurate estimates, land cover or other ancillary
  data may be used to better characterize the underlying source zone population density
  surface prior to areal interpolation. Although dasymetric techniques such as these
  are well documented, their effectiveness across different areal interpolation methods
  are not well established. This research compares the accuracy of a number of areal
  interpolation methods used to support temporal analysis of population data, and
  evaluates the effect of dasymetric mapping on interpolation accuracy. Our findings
  demonstrate that dasymetric refinement noticeably improves interpolation accuracy
  for the areal weighting, pycnophylactic, and target density weighting (TDW) methods
  of areal interpolation. A fourth method in which land cover densities are inherently
  incorporated, the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), performs equally well.
  Our results show that the dasymetrically refined TDW method outperforms other areal
  interpolation methods in most instances, but suggest that the EM algorithm may be
  preferred as the interval between enumeration periods grows large.
