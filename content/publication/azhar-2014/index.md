abstract: Introduction In the recent past, spells of extreme heat associated with
  appreciable mortality have been documented in developed countries, including North
  America and Europe. However, far fewer research reports are available from developing
  countries or specific cities in South Asia. In May 2010, Ahmedabad, India, faced
  a heat wave where the temperatures reached a high of 46.8°C with an apparent increase
  in mortality. The purpose of this study is to characterize the heat wave impact
  and assess the associated excess mortality.  Methods We conducted an analysis of
  all-cause mortality associated with a May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat,
  India, to determine whether extreme heat leads to excess mortality. Counts of all-cause
  deaths from May 1–31, 2010 were compared with the mean of counts from temporally
  matched periods in May 2009 and 2011 to calculate excess mortality. Other analyses
  included a 7-day moving average, mortality rate ratio analysis, and relationship
  between daily maximum temperature and daily all-cause death counts over the entire
  year of 2010, using month-wise correlations.  Results The May 2010 heat wave was
  associated with significant excess all-cause mortality. 4,462 all-cause deaths occurred,
  comprising an excess of 1,344 all-cause deaths, an estimated 43.1% increase when
  compared to the reference period (3,118 deaths). In monthly pair-wise comparisons
  for 2010, we found high correlations between mortality and daily maximum temperature
  during the locally hottest “summer” months of April (r = 0.69, p<0.001), May (r
  = 0.77, p<0.001), and June (r = 0.39, p<0.05). During a period of more intense heat
  (May 19–25, 2010), mortality rate ratios were 1.76 [95% CI 1.67–1.83, p<0.001] and
  2.12 [95% CI 2.03–2.21] applying reference periods (May 12–18, 2010) from various
  years.  Conclusion The May 2010 heat wave in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India had a substantial
  effect on all-cause excess mortality, even in this city where hot temperatures prevail
  through much of April-June.
