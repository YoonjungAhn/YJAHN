abstract: More frequent and intense periods of extreme heat (heatwaves) represent
  the most direct challenge to human health posed by climate change. Older adults
  are particularly vulnerable, especially those with common age-associated chronic
  health conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes,
  chronic kidney disease). In parallel, the global population is aging and age-associated
  disease rates are on the rise. Impairments in the physiological responses tasked
  with maintaining homeostasis during heat exposure have long been thought to contribute
  to increased risk of health disorders in older adults during heatwaves. As such,
  a comprehensive overview of the provisional links between age-related physiological
  dysfunction and elevated risk of heat-related injury in older adults would be of
  great value to healthcare officials and policy makers concerned with protecting
  heat-vulnerable sectors of the population from the adverse health impacts of heatwaves.
  In this narrative review, we therefore summarize our current understanding of the
  physiological mechanisms by which aging impairs the regulation of body temperature,
  hemodynamic stability and hydration status. We then examine how these impairments
  may contribute to acute pathophysiological events common during heatwaves (e.g.,
  heatstroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury) and discuss
  how age-associated chronic health conditions may exacerbate those impairments. Finally,
  we briefly consider the importance of physiological research in the development
  of climate-health programs aimed at protecting heat-vulnerable individuals.
