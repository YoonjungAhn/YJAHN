abstract: In this study, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the minimum rest time
  for the safety of South Korean outdoor workers during hot summer months (June to
  August) are examined based on the hourly wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) across
  27 weather stations in South Korea. The WBGT thresholds in the work-rest recommendation
  of the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency (KOSHA 2017) for the quantification
  of the minimum rest time are evaluated through a comparison of the given thresholds
  with the occurrences of occupational heat-related illness patients due to outdoor
  work during hot summer months in South Korea. The long-term (2009–2018) average
  of the hourly WBGT values during summer months shows that outdoor workers with a
  moderate workload are exposed to heat stress during approximately 30% of the entire
  daytime working hours (06:00–18:00). According to the WBGT thresholds modified from
  the KOSHA (2017) guidelines, the daily minimum rest time for a moderate workload
  noticeably increases up to 18% (11 min/h) in mid-summer (late July and early August).
  During mid-summer, the minimum rest time for a continuous moderate outdoor workload
  even increases up to 31% (18 min/h) between 12:00 and 13:00 and is regionally higher
  in the southwestern than in the southeastern regions of the Korean Peninsula. These
  results suggest that in summertime high-heat environments, a mandatory rest time
  must be provided according to appropriate heat management programs for the safety
  of workers.
