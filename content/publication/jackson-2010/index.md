abstract: Illness and mortality related to heat and worsening air quality are core
  public health concerns associated with climate change projections. We examined the
  historical relationship between age- and cause-specific mortality rates from 1980
  through 2006 and heat events at the 99th percentile of humidex values in the historic
  period from January 1, 1970 to December 31, 2006 in the greater Seattle area (King,
  Pierce and Snohomish counties), Spokane County, the Tri-Cities (Benton and Franklin
  counties) and Yakima County; the relative risks of mortality during heat events
  were applied to population and climate projections for Washington State to calculate
  number of deaths above the baseline (1980–2006) expected during projected heat events
  in 2025, 2045 and 2085. Three different warming scenarios were used in the analysis.
  Relative risks for the greater Seattle area showed a significant dose-response relationship
  between heat event duration and daily mortality rates for non-traumatic deaths for
  persons ages 45 and above, typically peaking at four days of exposure to humidex
  values above the 99th percentile. The largest number of projected excess deaths
  in all years and scenarios for the Seattle region was found for age 65 and above.
  Under the middle warming scenario, this age group is expected to have 96, 148 and
  266 excess deaths from all non-traumatic causes in 2025, 2045 and 2085, respectively.
  We also examined projected excess deaths due to ground-level ozone concentrations
  at mid century (2045–2054) in King and Spokane counties. Current (1997–2006) ozone
  measurements and mid-twenty-first century ozone projections were coupled with dose-response
  data from the scientific literature to produce estimates overall and cardiopulmonary
  mortality. Daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations are forecasted to be 16–28% higher
  in the mid twenty-first century compared to the recent decade of 1997–2006. By mid-century
  in King County the non-traumatic mortality rate related to ozone was projected to
  increase from baseline (0.026 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval 0.013–0.038)
  to 0.033 (95% CI 0.017–0.049). For the same health outcome in Spokane County, the
  baseline period rate of 0.058 (95% CI 0.030–0.085) was estimated increase to 0.068
  (95% CI 0.035–0.100) by mid-century. The cardiopulmonary death rate per 100,000
  due to ozone was estimated to increase from 0.011 (95% CI 0.005–0.017) to 0.015
  (0.007–0.022) in King County, and from 0.027 (95% CI 0.013–0.042) to 0.032 (95%
  CI 0.015–0.049) in Spokane County. Public health interventions aimed at protecting
  Washington’s population from excessive heat and increased ozone concentrations will
  become increasingly important for preventing deaths, especially among older adults.
  Furthermore, heat and air quality related illnesses that do not result in death,
  but are serious nevertheless, may be reduced by the same measures.
