abstract: The relationship between urbanization and economic growth has been perplexing.
  In this paper, we identify the pattern of global change and the correlation of urbanization
  and economic growth, using cross-sectional, panel estimation and geographic information
  systems (GIS) methods. The analysis has been carried out on a global geographical
  scale, while the timescale of the study spans the last 30 years. The data shows
  that urbanization levels have changed substantially during these three decades.
  Empirical findings from cross-sectional data and panel data support the general
  notion of close links between urbanization levels and GDP per capita. However, we
  also present significant evidence that there is no correlation between urbanization
  speed and economic growth rate at the global level. Hence, we conclude that a given
  country cannot obtain the expected economic benefits from accelerated urbanization,
  especially if it takes the form of government-led urbanization. In addition, only
  when all facets are taken into consideration can we fully assess the urbanization
  process.
