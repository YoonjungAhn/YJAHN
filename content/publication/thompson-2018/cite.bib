 note = {The author insisted that location based environment exposure data is nesseary to to investigate the heat expousre of individual. <br/>Therefore, the author used sensors and collected personal monitoring of environmental temperautre and geo-referenced time activity patterns data of outdoor workers in South-estern United State in three differenet universities. They shared the mornitoring result with the participants and surveyed how they feel about it.<br/>The data was collected during summer period. The author applied Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Chi-squre test to research if there is a difference between groups. <br/>As a result, this sutdy found out that the participants are posivite about the research and wish that they can be informed their heat exposure during working hours.},
