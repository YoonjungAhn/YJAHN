abstract: 'With the doubling of urban population within the next two decades and the
  disproportionate growth of megacities, it is critical to explore the synergism between
  urban heat and pollution. In this paper, a systematic review is conducted on the
  existing knowledge, collected since 1990, on the link between urban heat island
  (UHI) and urban pollution island (UPI). Results from 16 countries and 11 KÃ¶ppen-Geiger
  climatic zones are perused and compared to delineate methodological and experimental
  trends, geographical dependencies and research gaps. Detailed content analysis is
  conducted according to five prominent topics: i) the role of UHI on temperature-dependent
  chemistry, ii) the daytime/nighttime variability in the UHI-UPI interaction, iii)
  the role of urban geomorphic types, forms and growth schemes, iv) future trends
  and v) primary and secondary effects of UHI mitigation on urban air quality. Different
  approaches and observations are eventually harmonized to outline opportunities and
  challenges towards the disentanglement and/or the two-way mitigation of both phenomena.
  This will help governments and urban planners to deliver coping strategies and precautions
  towards a more salutogenic urban design.'
