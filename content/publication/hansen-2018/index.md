abstract: Heat exposure can be a health hazard for many Australian workers in both
  outdoor and indoor situations. With many heat-related incidents left unreported,
  it is often difficult to determine the underlying causal factors. This study aims
  to provide insights into perceptions of potentially unsafe or uncomfortably hot
  working conditions that can affect occupational health and safety using information
  provided by the public and workers to the safety regulator in South Australia (SafeWork
  SA). Details of complaints regarding heat exposure to the regulator’s “Help Centre”
  were assembled in a dataset and the textual data analysed thematically. The findings
  showed that the majority of calls relate to indoor work environments such as kitchens,
  factories, and warehouses. The main themes identified were work environment, health
  effects, and organisational issues. Impacts of hot working conditions ranged from
  discomfort to serious heat-related illnesses. Poor management practices and inflexibility
  of supervisors featured strongly amongst callers’ concerns. With temperatures predicted
  to increase and energy prices escalating, this timely study, using naturalistic
  data, highlights accounts of hot working conditions that can compromise workers’
  health and safety and the need for suitable measures to prevent heat stress. These
  could include risk assessments to assess the likelihood of heat stress in workplaces
  where excessively hot conditions prevail.
