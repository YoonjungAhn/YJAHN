abstract: This study examined relationships among individual demographics, environmental
  features (e.g., fast food outlet density, park land use) of residential neighborhoods
  and activity spaces, and weight-related behaviors (diet, physical activity). Participantsâ€™
  movement was tracked for 7 days using global positioning systems (GPS). Two activity
  space measures (one standard deviation ellipse, daily path area) were derived from
  the GPS data. Activity spaces were generally larger than residential neighborhoods;
  environmental features of residential neighborhoods and activity spaces were weakly
  associated; and some activity space environmental features were related to dietary
  behaviors. Activity spaces may provide new insights into environmental influences
  on obesity-related behaviors.
