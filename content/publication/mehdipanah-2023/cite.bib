 abstract = {Objectives. To examine how redlining, a historical racially discriminatory housing policy implemented by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), is associated with current neighborhood determinants of health in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Methods. We analyzed associations between census tract‒level HOLC color grades (red = "hazardous"; yellow = "declining"; blue = "desirable"; and green = "best") and a developed neighborhood determinants of health index (DOHI) consisting of 8 indicators of economic, social, governance, and physical environment characteristics using spatial regression analysis and controlling for change in the census tract's percentage of White residents. Results. A total of 484 Detroit Metropolitan Area census tracts had HOLC grades. The mean redlining score across all census tracts was 3.02 (min = 1.0; max = 4.0). The mean contemporary DOHI was 19.11 (min = 8.0; max = 36.0). Regression models show significantly higher DOHI scores in yellowlined (b = 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52, 3.91), bluelined (b = 5.33; 95% CI = 3.65, 7.01), and greenlined (b = 9.25; 95% CI = 6.86, 11.64) neighborhoods compared with redlined neighborhoods. Conclusions. Historical redlined neighborhoods experience contemporary determinants of health conditions that are less conducive to health compared with those in nonredlined neighborhoods. These differences also reflect the accumulation of resources essential for health in greenlined neighborhoods. Public Health Implications. Neighborhood development initiatives should consider the impacts of historical redlining on contemporary neighborhood conditions.
