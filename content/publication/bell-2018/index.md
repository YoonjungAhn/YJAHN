abstract: 'Extreme weather and climate-related events affect human health by causing
  death, injury, and illness, as well as having large socioeconomic impacts. Climate
  change has caused changes in extreme event frequency, intensity, and geographic
  distribution, and will continue to be a driver for change in the future. Some of
  these events include heat waves, droughts, wildfires, dust storms, flooding rains,
  coastal flooding, storm surges, and hurricanes. The pathways connecting extreme
  events to health outcomes and economic losses can be diverse and complex. The difficulty
  in predicting these relationships comes from the local societal and environmental
  factors that affect disease burden. More information is needed about the impacts
  of climate change on public health and economies to effectively plan for and adapt
  to climate change. This paper describes some of the ways extreme events are changing
  and provides examples of the potential impacts on human health and infrastructure.
  It also identifies key research gaps to be addressed to improve the resilience of
  public health to extreme events in the future. Implications: Extreme weather and
  climate events affect human health by causing death, injury, and illness, as well
  as having large socioeconomic impacts. Climate change has caused changes in extreme
  event frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution, and will continue to be
  a driver for change in the future. Some of these events include heat waves, droughts,
  wildfires, flooding rains, coastal flooding, surges, and hurricanes. The pathways
