abstract: 'Extreme summertime heat is a significant public health threat that disproportionately
  impacts vulnerable urban populations. Research on health impacts of climate change
  (including increasing intensity, duration, and frequency of hot weather) is sometimes
  designed and implemented without the involvement of the communities being studied,
  i.e., “community-placed” not “community-based.” We describe how the Heatwaves, Housing,
  and Health: Increasing Climate Resiliency in Detroit (HHH) partnership engaged relevant
  communities by integrating a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach
  into an existing, academic-designed research project through a steering committee
  of community and academic partners. Using a case study approach, we analyze program
  documentation, partnership evaluation questionnaires, and HHH steering committee
  meeting notes. We describe the CBPR process by which we successfully collected research
  data in Detroit during summer 2016, engaged in collaborative analysis of data, and
  shared results with Detroit residents. Evaluations of the partnership over 2 years
  show community involvement in research; enhanced capacities; success in securing
  new grant funding; and ways that CBPR strengthened the validity, relevance, and
  translation of research. Engaging communities as equal partners using CBPR, even
  after a study is underway, can strengthen research to understand and address the
  impacts of extreme heat on health and equity in urban communities.'
