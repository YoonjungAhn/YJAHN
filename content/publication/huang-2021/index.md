abstract: In the Big Data era, Earth observation is becoming a complex process integrating
  physical and social sectors. This study presents an approach to generating a 100
  m population grid in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) by disaggregating the
  US census records using 125 million of building footprints released by Microsoft
  in 2018. Land-use data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowdsourcing platform, was
  applied to trim original footprints by removing the non-residential buildings. After
  trimming, several metrics of building measurements such as building size and building
  count in a census tract were used as weighting scenarios, with which a dasymetric
  model was applied to disaggregate the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates
  (2013â€“2017) into a 100 m population grid product. The results confirm that the OSM
  trimming process removes non-residential buildings and thus provides a better representation
  of population distribution within complicated urban fabrics. The building size in
  the census tract is found in the optimal weighting scenario. The product is 2.5Gb
  in size containing 800 million populated grids and is currently hosted by ESRI (http://arcg.is/19S4qK)
  for visualization. The data can be accessed via https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DLGP7Y.
  With the accelerated acquisition of high-resolution spatial data, the product could
  be easily updated for spatial and temporal continuity.
