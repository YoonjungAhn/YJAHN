abstract: Daily mortality is typically higher on hot days in urban areas, and certain
  population groups experience disproportionate risk. Air conditioning (AC) has been
  recommended to mitigate heat-related illness and death. We examined whether AC prevalence
  explained differing heat-related mortality effects by race. Poisson regression was
  used to model daily mortality in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh.
  Predictors included natural splines of time (to control seasonal patterns); mean
  daily apparent temperature on the day of death, and averaged over lags 1-3; barometric
  pressure; day of week; and a linear term for airborne particles. Separate, city-specific
  models were fit to death counts stratified by race (Black or White) to derive the
  percent change in mortality at 29°C, relative to 15°C (lag 0). Next, city-specific
  effects were regressed on city- and race-specific AC prevalence. Combined effect
  estimates across all cities were calculated using inverse variance-weighted averages.
  Prevalence of central AC among Black households was less than half that among White
  households in all four cities, and deaths among Blacks were more strongly associated
  with hot temperatures. Central AC prevalence explained some of the differences in
  heat effects by race, but room-unit AC did not. Efforts to reduce disparities in
  heat-related mortality should consider access to AC. © The Author 2005. Published
