abstract: 'Many recreational and elite runners participate in distance races each
  year. When these events are conducted in hot or cold conditions, the risk of environmental
  illness increases. However, exertional hyperthermia, hypothermia, dehydration, and
  other related problems may be minimized with pre-event education and preparation.
  This position stand provides recommendations for the medical director and other
  race officials in the following areas: scheduling; organizing personnel, facilities,
  supplies, equipment, and communication; providing competitor education; measuring
  environmental stress; providing fluids; and avoiding potential legal liabilities.
  This document also describes the predisposing conditions, recognition, and treatment
  of the four most common environmental illnesses: heat exhaustion, heatstroke, hypothermia,
  and frostbite. The objectives of this position stand are: 1) To educate distance
  running event officials and participants about the most common forms of environmental
  illness including predisposing conditions, warning signs, susceptibility, and incidence
  reduction. 2) To advise race officials of their legal responsibilities and potential
  liability with regard to event safety and injury prevention. 3) To recommend that
  race officials consult local weather archives and plan events at times likely to
  be of low environmental stress to minimize detrimental effects on participants.
  4) To encourage race officials to warn participants about environmental stress on
  race day and its implications for heat and cold illness. 5) To inform race officials
  of preventive actions that may reduce debilitation and environmental illness. 6)
  To describe the personnel, equipment, and supplies necessary to reduce and treat
  cases of collapse and environmental illness.'
