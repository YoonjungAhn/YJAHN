abstract: Bicycling is an affordable, environmentally friendly alternative transportation
  mode to motorized travel. A common task performed by bikers is to find good routes
  in an area, where the quality of a route is based on safety, efficiency, and enjoyment.
  Finding routes involves trial and error as well as exchanging information between
  members of a bike community. Biketastic is a platform that enriches this experimentation
  and route sharing process making it both easier and more effective. Using a mobile
  phone application and online map visualization, bikers are able to document and
  share routes, ride statistics, sensed information to infer route roughness and noisiness,
  and media that documents ride experience. Biketastic was designed to ensure the
  link between information gathering, visualization, and bicycling practices. In this
  paper, we present architecture and algorithms for route data inferences and visualization.
  We evaluate the system based on feedback from bicyclists provided during a two-week
  pilot. Â© 2010 ACM.
