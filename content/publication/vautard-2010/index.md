abstract: Surface winds have declined in China, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic,
  the United States and Australia over the past few decades. The precise cause of
  the stilling is uncertain. Here, we analyse the extent and potential cause of changes
  in surface wind speeds over the northern mid-latitudes between 1979 and 2008, using
  data from 822 surface weather stations. We show that surface wind speeds have declined
  by 5g-15% over almost all continental areas in the northern mid-latitudes, and that
  strong winds have slowed faster than weak winds. In contrast, upper-air winds calculated
  from sea-level pressure gradients, and winds from weather reanalyses, exhibited
  no such trend. Changes in atmospheric circulation that are captured by reanalysis
  data explain 10g-50% of the surface wind slowdown. In addition, mesoscale model
  simulations suggest that an increase in surface roughnessg-the magnitude of which
  is estimated from increases in biomass and land-use change in Eurasiag-could explain
  between 25 and 60% of the stilling. Moreover, regions of pronounced stilling generally
  coincided with regions where biomass has increased over the past 30 years, supporting
  the role of vegetation increases in wind slowdown. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
