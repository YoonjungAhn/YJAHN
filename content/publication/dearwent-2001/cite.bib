 abstract = {The assignment of locational attributes to a study subject in epidemiologic analyses is commonly referred to as georeferencing. When georeferencing study subjects to a point location using their residential street address, most researchers rely on the street centerline data model. This study assessed the potential locational bias introduced using street centerline data. It also evaluated georeferencing effects on a location-dependent, exposure assessment process. For comparison purposes, subjects were georeferenced to the center of their residential parcel of land using digitized parcel maps. A total of 10,026 study subjects residing in Jefferson County, Alabama were georeferenced using both street centerline and residential parcel methods. The mean nondirectional, linear distance between points georeferenced using both methods was 246 ft with a range of 11 to 13,260 ft. Correlation coefficients comparing differences in exposure estimates were generated for all 10,026 subjects. Coefficients increased as the geographic areas of analysis around study subjects increased, indicating the influence of nondifferential exposure misclassification.},
