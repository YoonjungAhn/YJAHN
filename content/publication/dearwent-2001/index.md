abstract: The assignment of locational attributes to a study subject in epidemiologic
  analyses is commonly referred to as georeferencing. When georeferencing study subjects
  to a point location using their residential street address, most researchers rely
  on the street centerline data model. This study assessed the potential locational
  bias introduced using street centerline data. It also evaluated georeferencing effects
  on a location-dependent, exposure assessment process. For comparison purposes, subjects
  were georeferenced to the center of their residential parcel of land using digitized
  parcel maps. A total of 10,026 study subjects residing in Jefferson County, Alabama
  were georeferenced using both street centerline and residential parcel methods.
  The mean nondirectional, linear distance between points georeferenced using both
  methods was 246 ft with a range of 11 to 13,260 ft. Correlation coefficients comparing
  differences in exposure estimates were generated for all 10,026 subjects. Coefficients
  increased as the geographic areas of analysis around study subjects increased, indicating
  the influence of nondifferential exposure misclassification.
