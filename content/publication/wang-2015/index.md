abstract: This study examines locational patterns of housing choice vouchers in Duval
  County, Florida, using the Housing Suitability Model (HSM), a newly developed geographic
  information systemâ€“based model that evaluates residential land parcels and neighborhoods
  in terms of their suitability for affordable housing. The HSM was used to characterize
  voucher locations and other residential parcels across the county in terms of opportunity
  and accessibility. The analysis explores the tradeoffs between opportunity and accessibility
  inherent in many neighborhoods throughout the county. It finds that voucher holders'
  locations lag substantially behind other residential locations in terms of opportunity
  measures but are more comparable in terms of accessibility. Further analysis finds
  differences in opportunity and accessibility among subgroups of voucher holders
  by various demographic characteristics. The study recommends the incorporation of
  opportunity and accessibility for voucher holders into local housing planning, including
  the implementation of proposed rules for Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.
