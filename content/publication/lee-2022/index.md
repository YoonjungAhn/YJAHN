abstract: Increasing surface air temperature is a fundamental characteristic of a
  warming world. Rising temperatures have potential impacts on human health through
  heat stress. One heat stress metric is the wet-bulb globe temperature, which takes
  into consideration the effects of radiation, humidity, and wind speed. It also has
  broad health and environmental implications. This study presents wet-bulb globe
  temperatures calculated from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis and combines it with health guidelines
  to assess heat stress variability and the potential for reduction in labor hours
  over the past decade on both the continental and urban scale. Compared to 2010–2014,
  there was a general increase in heat stress during the period from 2015 to 2019
  throughout the northern hemisphere, with the largest warming found in tropical regions,
  especially in the northern part of the Indian Peninsula. On the urban scale, our
  results suggest that heat stress might have led to a reduction in labor hours by
  up to ~20% in some Asian cities subject to work–rest regulations. Extremes in heat
  stress can be explained by changes in radiation and circulation. The resultant threat
  is highest in developing countries in tropical areas where workers often have limited
  legal protection and healthcare. The effect of heat stress exposure is therefore
  a collective challenge with environmental, economic, and social implications.
