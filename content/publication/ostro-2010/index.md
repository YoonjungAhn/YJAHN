abstract: Several investigators have documented the effect of temperature on mortality,
  although fewer have studied its impact on morbidity. In addition, little is known
  about the effectiveness of mitigation strategies such as use of air conditioners
  (ACs). The authors investigated the association between temperature and hospital
  admissions in California from 1999 to 2005. They also determined whether AC ownership
  and usage, assessed at the zip-code level, mitigated this association. Because of
  the unique spatial pattern of income and climate in California, confounding of AC
  effects by other local factors is less likely. The authors included only persons
  who had a temperature monitor within 25 km of their residential zip code. Using
  a time-stratified case-crossover approach, the authors observed a significantly
  increased risk of hospitalization for multiple diseases, including cardiovascular
  disease, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, respiratory disease, pneumonia,
  dehydration, heat stroke, diabetes, and acute renal failure, with a 10°F increase
  in same-day apparent temperature. They also found that ownership and usage of ACs
  significantly reduced the effects of temperature on these health outcomes, after
  controlling for potential confounding by family income and other socioeconomic factors.
  These results demonstrate important effects of temperature on public health and
  the potential for mitigation. © The Author 2010.
