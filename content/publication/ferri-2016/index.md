abstract: 'The wide propagation of devices, such as mobile phones, that include a
  global positioning system (GPS) sensor has popularised the storing of geographic
  information for different kinds of activities, many of them recreational, such as
  sport. Extracting and learning knowledge from GPS data can provide useful geographic
  information that can be used for the design of novel applications. In this paper
  we address the problem of identifying the sport from a GPS track that is recorded
  during a sport session. For that purpose, we store 8500 GPS tracks from ten different
  kinds of sports. We extract twelve features that are able to represent the activity
  that was recorded in a GPS track. From these features several models are induced
  by diverse machine learning classification techniques. We study the problem from
  two different perspectives: flat classification, i.e, models classify the track
  in one of the ten possible sport types; and hierarchical classification, i.e. given
  the high number of classes and the structure of the problem, we induce a hierarchy
  in the classes and we address the problem as a hierarchical classification problem.
  For this second framework, we analyse three different approaches. According to our
  results, multiclassifier systems based on decision trees obtain the better performance
  in both scenarios.'
