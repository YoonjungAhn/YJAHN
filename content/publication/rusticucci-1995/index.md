abstract: The diurnal and seasonal patterns of the dry and wet bulb temperatures over
  Argentina are studied. The wet bulb temperature frequency distributions have negative
  skewness over all the country. The higher values are in the lower latitude stations,
  which are under a subtropical regime. The dry bulb temperature frequency distributions
  change their skewness from north (negative values) to south, and the highest positive
  value occurs at the most southerly station, which is under a middle latitude regime.
  Three stations in the Buenos Aires area are analysed to study the effects of the
  river and the city on temperature. The effects of the city and the river on the
  dry bulb temperature and the wet bulb temperature depend on the wind direction and
  the time of day. The effect of the river also depends on the month. These effects
  are also present in the anomalies. If it is necessary to represent extreme climatic
  or synoptic conditions over a region then the city stations are more appropriate
  than coastal ones. Copyright Â© 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd
