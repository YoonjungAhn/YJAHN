abstract: Increased popularity of smartphones has great potential to assist individuals
  in making healthy changes to their behaviour. Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are
  fast becoming a healthcare concern in modern societies. This study takes an important
  step in designing persuasive fitness applications (or apps) that can enhance the
  physical activity behaviour of individuals. We conceptualize that persuasive technology
  design principles embedded in social cognitive theory constructs will lead to the
  design of successful fitness apps. The conceptual model will be tested by analysing
  the design principles in existing mobile fitness apps. The theoretical and practical
  implications are discussed.
