abstract: "Background: The earth's climate is warming and the frequency, duration,
  and severity of heat waves are increasing. Meanwhile, the world's population is
  rapidly aging. Epidemiological data demonstrate exponentially greater increases
  in morbidity and mortality during heat waves in adults â‰¥65 years. Laboratory data
  substantiate the mechanistic underpinnings of age-associated differences in thermoregulatory
  function. However, the specific combinations of environmental conditions (i.e.,
  ambient temperature and absolute/relative humidity) above which older adults are
  at increased risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality are less clear. Methods:
  This review was conducted to (1) examine the recent (past 3 years) literature regarding
  heat-related morbidity and mortality in the elderly and discuss projections of future
  heat-related morbidity and mortality based on climate model data, and (2) detail
  the background and unique methodology of our ongoing laboratory-based projects aimed
  toward identifying the specific environmental conditions that result in elevated
  risk of heat illness in older adults, and the implications of using the data toward
  the development of evidence-based safety interventions in a continually-warming
  climate (PSU HEAT; Human Environmental Age Thresholds). Results: The recent literature
  demonstrates that extreme heat continues to be increasingly detrimental to the health
  of the elderly and that this is apparent across the world, although the specific
  environmental conditions above which older adults are at increased risk of heat-related
  morbidity and mortality remain unclear. Conclusion: Characterizing the environmental
  conditions above which risk of heat-related illnesses increase remains critical
  to enact policy decisions and mitigation efforts to protect vulnerable people during
  extreme heat events."
