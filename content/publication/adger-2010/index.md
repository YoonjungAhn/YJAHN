abstract: The effects of observed and future changes in climate are spatially and
  socially differentiated. The impacts of future changes will be felt particularly
  by resource-dependent communities through a multitude of primary and secondary effects
  cascading through natural and social systems. Given that the world is increasingly
  faced with risks of climate change that are at the boundaries of human experience3,
  there is an urgent need to learn from past and present adaptation strategies to
  understand both the processes by which adaptation takes place and the limitations
  of the various agents of change -- states, markets, and civil society -- in these
  processes. Societies have inherent capacities to adapt to climate change. In this
  article, I argue that these capacities are bound up in their ability to act collectively.
