abstract: "Within a five-year 'Sport and Environment Cooperation' between the German
  Olympic Sports Federation (DOSB) and the German Federal Environmental Foundation
  (DBU), 35 projects with total funding of 2.3 million euros have been rea lised.
  Cooperation focused on three key issues: climate protection, nature conservation
  and environmental communica tion. In each of these issues not only new strategies
  for environmentally friendly sports activities have been developed and established,
  but also networking between sports federations and environmental/nature conservation
  organisa tions has been further improved. Nevertheless, the potential of sports
  - especially in the field of nature conservation - is far from exhausted. The examples
  on the themes of habitat restoration, environmental management and environmental
  education outlined in this article make this evident."
