abstract: Two hundred million people in the US are overweight or obese mirroring a
  worldwide trend that is asso-ciated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Health
  and fitness mobile technology applications have great capacities for supporting
  dieters' life-style changes and could profit from and provide input of health behavior
  theories. Those theories have been demonstrated with massive clinical evidence to
  be efficient for fostering healthy lifestyle changes and weight loss. This research
  reviewed the 100 most popular mo-bile technology applications from iTunes App Store's
  Health and Fitness category in respect coverage of health behavior theories' concepts
  und chose 14 of those for a complete analysis. Applications provide good support
  for athletes' workouts and have great potential to be extended to serve overweight
  users as well. Missing features could be easily implemented given the current state
  of technology. These devel-opments look promising for tackling sustained weight
  loss in many mobile technology users.
