abstract: Intensive urbanization has led to the depletion of vegetation and its replacement
  by impervious surfaces, resulting in the accumulation of thermal energy, with urban
  areas becoming warmer than peripheral areas, a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat
  Island (UHI). Much of the literature has focused on the relationship between the
  UHI and urban factors at peak summer times, without considering seasonality effects.
  There is, however, clear evidence that the UHI varies over the year, with implications
  for greening mitigation strategies, as green spaces are known to help reduce summer
  local temperatures, but also reduce exposure to winter cold, thus increasing local
  winter temperatures. Both effects are likely to generate, in varying extents, benefits
  in terms of better health and reduced energy usage and pollution emissions. This
  paper addresses the seasonality of the impacts of building rooftop and fa√ßade areas,
  urban canyons, water bodies, vegetation, and solar radiation, on UHI intensity.
  In a case study of the central area of Columbus, Ohio, these various 2D and 3D inputs,
  as well as land surface temperatures estimated with remotely-sensed imagery, are
  captured within a spatial grid, and used in spatial regression analyses. The estimation
  results confirm the opposite effects of greenery, measured by the NDVI, on summer
  and winter temperatures. The estimated models are then used to simulate the seasonal
  changes in temperatures resulting from a potential urban greening strategy involving
  green roofs, the greening of parking lots and other vacant spaces, and vegetation
  densification. The results show that increased greenery reduces temperatures in
  summer and increases them in winter, thus demonstrating that greening and land-use
  policies designed to mitigate the UHI must account for seasonal effects to achieve
  year-long effectiveness.
