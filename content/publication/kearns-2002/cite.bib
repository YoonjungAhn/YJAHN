 abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on the positioning of health geography within the wider academic landscapes of geography and health-related research. Drawing on examples from a number of countries, we consider the extent to which a 'new geography of health' has emerged in recent years. We structure our discussion around the themes of place, theoretical engagement and critical relevancy. Changes within the subdiscipline are placed in the context of a central question: what is new about the new geography of health.},
