abstract: "In this paper, we reflect on the positioning of health geography within
  the wider academic landscapes of geography and health-related research. Drawing
  on examples from a number of countries, we consider the extent to which a 'new geography
  of health' has emerged in recent years. We structure our discussion around the themes
  of place, theoretical engagement and critical relevancy. Changes within the subdiscipline
  are placed in the context of a central question: what is new about the new geography
  of health."
