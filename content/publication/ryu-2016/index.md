abstract: '© 2016, The Author(s). Since recently, the potential of torrential downpour
  is increased and the flood damage shows increasing trend, in this study, the method
  to assess the flood vulnerability was established for the industrial parks, which
  is the driving power of the economic growth in Korea, and the results were analyzed.
  The vulnerability of each industrial parks was analyzed using three indicators:
  climate exposure, sensitivity and the adaptation ability, and the indicator value
  was calculated by selecting the proxy variable by each indicator. Among the primarily
  indicators, the final indicators were selected through the site investigation and
  in-depth interview. The vulnerability assessment was performed not only for the
  present but for the future (2020s, 2050s and 2100s). In the analysis results, Ulsan
  Mipo National Industrial Park was the most vulnerable for the present but in 2020s,
  Gwangyang National Industrial Park and Myeongji-Noksan National Industrial Park
  in 2050s and 2100s were assessed as most vulnerable. In the results of flooding
  vulnerability assessment, south coast industrial parks are the most vulnerable region during
  baseline and future. In addition, such industrial parks mostly built in the early
  phase of industrialization and they have advantage in import and export but were
  represented to be highly vulnerable due to aged infrastructures. In the industrial
  parks, as the enterprises are concentrated, it is easy to exchange the information
  and logistics, but the damage of natural disasters due to flooding can be aggravated
  due to the characteristics of the concentration. Actually, there are some cases
  that the industrial parks and the enterprises received the flooing damage in the
  highly vulnerable area by the torrential downpour. In this study, the vulnerability
  assessment was performed for the flooding damage by the torrential downpour for
  the industrial parks and the potential that the this study can be used as a useful
  decision-making tool in deciding the priority of adaptation ability was confirmed.'
