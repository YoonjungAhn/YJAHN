abstract: The case-crossover study design in principle allows testing for an acute
  health effect of an exposure such as air pollution with restriction in time to remove
  seasonal confounding. We argue that much thinking about this design has been based
  on false analogies with matched case-control studies, and show that the usual design
  and analysis of case-crossover studies introduce a previously unrecognized bias
  by not conditioning correctly on the sampling scheme. We show that the usual conditional
  logistic regression analysis is a valid maximum likelihood method for a simple modification
  of the case-crossover design that divides time into strata. However, the bias from
  standard case-crossover designs will typically be small. Copyright (C) 2000 John
