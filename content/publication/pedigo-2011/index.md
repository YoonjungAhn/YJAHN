abstract: 'Background: Stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are serious public health
  burdens in the US. These burdens vary by geographic location with the highest mortality
  risks reported in the southeastern US. While these disparities have been investigated
  at state and county levels, little is known regarding disparities in risk at lower
  levels of geography, such as neighborhoods. Therefore, the objective of this study
  was to investigate spatial patterns of stroke and MI mortality risks in the East
  Tennessee Appalachian Region so as to identify neighborhoods with the highest risks.
  Methods. Stroke and MI mortality data for the period 1999-2007, obtained free of
  charge upon request from the Tennessee Department of Health, were aggregated to
  the census tract (neighborhood) level. Mortality risks were age-standardized by
  the direct method. To adjust for spatial autocorrelation, population heterogeneity,
  and variance instability, standardized risks were smoothed using Spatial Empirical
  Bayesian technique. Spatial clusters of high risks were identified using spatial
  scan statistics, with a discrete Poisson model adjusted for age and using a 5% scanning
  window. Significance testing was performed using 999 Monte Carlo permutations. Logistic
  models were used to investigate neighborhood level socioeconomic and demographic
  predictors of the identified spatial clusters. Results: There were 3,824 stroke
  deaths and 5,018 MI deaths. Neighborhoods with significantly high mortality risks
  were identified. Annual stroke mortality risks ranged from 0 to 182 per 100,000
  population (median: 55.6), while annual MI mortality risks ranged from 0 to 243
  per 100,000 population (median: 65.5). Stroke and MI mortality risks exceeded the
  state risks of 67.5 and 85.5 in 28% and 32% of the neighborhoods, respectively.
  Six and ten significant (p < 0.001) spatial clusters of high risk of stroke and
  MI mortality were identified, respectively. Neighborhoods belonging to high risk
  clusters of stroke and MI mortality tended to have high proportions of the population
  with low education attainment. Conclusions: These methods for identifying disparities
  in mortality risks across neighborhoods are useful for identifying high risk communities
  and for guiding population health programs aimed at addressing health disparities
  and improving population health. Â© 2011 Pedigo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'
