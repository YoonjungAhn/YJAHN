abstract: The changing manufacturing economy has received scant attention in research
  on environmental inequalities, even though manufacturing work in the United States
  has dropped precipitously since the mid-20th century. I integrate manufacturing
  decline in metropolitan areas into the study of environmental inequality by using
  data on industrial air pollution in 1990, 2000, and 2010. I test to see if an indicator
  of change in the number of manufacturing workers in a metropolitan area from 1970
  to each of the three study years is associated with more or less industrially produced
  toxic emissions. Findings show, somewhat counterintuitively, that metropolitan areas
  that have had a larger drop in manufacturing work are linked to greater industrial
  air pollution and that these findings hold in all U.S. regions except the West.
  Implications focus on how the indelible imprint of manufacturing history may condition
  contemporary pollution levels.
