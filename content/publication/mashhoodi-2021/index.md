abstract: "Severe land surface temperature (LST) significantly impacts residents'
  thermal discomfort and can be life-threatening during warm seasons. Therefore, it
  is essential to identify the inequalities in LST exposure, i.e. the socioeconomic
  groups who are over- or underexposed to LST. There is a knowledge gap in the literature:
  there is no previous study which differentiates between national-scale inequalities
  -i.e. inequalities apparent in all location of a country, and the local-scale inequalities
  -i.e. inequalities existing in some areas of a country. Employing a semi-parametric
  geographically weighted regression model to study LST in Dutch residential zones
  in the summer of 2014, the results of this study show that two national-scale inequalities
  are significant: overexposure of high-income groups and underexposure of the owners
  of high-value properties. Additionally, eight local-scale inequalities are identified.
  Among the latter, ethnic inequalities, overexposure of Non-western and Western immigrants,
  found to be the most severe and frequent at the local scale. Additionally, females
  are often the second most overexposed to LST at the local-scale. To a lesser degree
  Rental dwellings and Population age 15âˆ’24 are the second most overexposed of a zone's
  population. In the end, the results and policy implications are discussed."
