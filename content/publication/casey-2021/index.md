abstract: Wildfire smoke harms health. We add to this literature by evaluating the
  health effects of California's 2018 Carr Fire and preceding wildfire seasons in
  Shasta County. Methods With data from the Shasta County Health and Human Services
  Agency, we examined the link between weekly wildfire fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
  exposure estimated using a spatiotemporal multiple imputation approach and emergency
  department (ED) visits and mortality using time-series models that controlled for
  temporal trends and temperature. Results Between 2013 and 2018, Shasta County experienced
  19 weeks with average wildfire PM2.5 ≥5.5 μg/m3 (hereafter, \"high wildfire PM2.5
  concentration\"). Among all Shasta County Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs; n =
  36), we detected no association between high wildfire PM2.5 concentrations and respiratory
  or circulatory disease-related ED visits or mortality. Subsequent analyses were
  confined to valley ZCTAs (n = 11, lower elevation, majority of population, worse
  air quality in general). In valley ZCTAs, high wildfire PM2.5 was associated with
  a 14.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2, 24.9) increase in same-week respiratory
  disease-related ED visits but no increase in the subsequent 2 weeks nor on circulatory
  disease-related mortality or ED visits or all-cause mortality. Two weeks after high
  wildfire PM2.5 weeks, respiratory disease-related deaths decreased (-31.5%, 95%
  CI = -64.4, 1.5). The 2018 Carr Fire appeared to increase respiratory disease-related
  ED visits by 27.0% (95% CI = 4.0, 50.0) over expectation and possibly reduce circulatory
  disease-related deaths (-18.2%, 95% CI = -39.4, 2.9). Conclusions As climate change
  fuels wildfire seasons, studies must continue to evaluate their health effects,
  particularly in highly exposed populations.
