abstract: "One approach to delaying the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
  is to reduce human travel by imposing travel restriction policies. Understanding
  the actual human mobility response to such policies remains a challenge owing to
  the lack of an observed and large-scale dataset describing human mobility during
  the pandemic. This study uses an integrated dataset, consisting of anonymized and
  privacy-protected location data from over 150 million monthly active samples in
  the USA, COVID-19 case data and census population information, to uncover mobility
  changes during COVID-19 and under the stay-at-home state orders in the USA. The
  study successfully quantifies human mobility responses with three important metrics:
  daily average number of trips per person; daily average person-miles travelled;
  and daily percentage of residents staying at home. The data analytics reveal a spontaneous
  mobility reduction that occurred regardless of government actions and a 'floor'
  phenomenon, where human mobility reached a lower bound and stopped decreasing soon
  after each state announced the stay-at-home order. A set of longitudinal models
  is then developed and confirms that the states' stay-at-home policies have only
  led to about a 5% reduction in average daily human mobility. Lessons learned from
  the data analytics and longitudinal models offer valuable insights for government
  actions in preparation for another COVID-19 surge or another virus outbreak in the
  future."
