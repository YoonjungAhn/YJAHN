abstract: We are entering an era of big data - data sets that are characterised by
  high volume, velocity, variety, exhaustivity, resolution and indexicality, relationality
  and flexibility. Much of these data are spatially and temporally referenced and
  offer many possibilities for enhancing geographical understanding, including for
  post-positivist scholars. Big data also, however, poses a number of challenges and
  risks to geographic scholarship and raises a number of taxing epistemological, methodological
  and ethical questions. Geographers need to grasp the opportunities whilst at the
  same time tackling the challenges, ameliorating the risks and thinking critically
  about big data as well as conducting big data studies. Failing to do so could be
  quite costly as the discipline gets left behind as others leverage insights from
  the growing data deluge. Â© The Author(s) 2013.
