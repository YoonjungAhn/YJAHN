abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The evidence that heat waves can result in both increased deaths
  and illness is subs tantial, and concern over this issue is rising because of climate
  change. Adverse health impacts from heat waves can be avoided, and epidemiologic
  studies have identified specific population and community characteristics that mark
  vulnerability to heat waves. OBJECTIVES: We situated vulnerability to heat in geographic
  space and identified potential areas for intervention and further research. METHODS:
  We mapped and analyzed 10 vulnerability factors for heat-related morbidity/mortality
  in the United States: six demographic characteristics and two household air conditioning
  variables from the U.S. Census Bureau, vegetation cover from satellite images, and
  diabetes prevalence from a national survey. We performed a factor analysis of these
  10 variables and assigned values of increasing vulnerability for the four resulting
  factors to each of 39,794 census tracts. We added the four factor scores to obtain
  a cumulative heat vulnerability index value. RESULTS: Four factors explained > 75%
  of the total variance in the original 10 vulnerability variables: a) social/environmental
  vulnerability (combined education/poverty/race/green space), b) social isolation,
  c) air conditioning prevalence, and d) proportion elderly/diabetes. We found substantial
  spatial variability of heat vulnerability nationally, with generally higher vulnerability
  in the Northeast and Pacific Coast and the lowest in the Southeast. In urban areas,
  inner cities showed the highest vulnerability to heat. CONCLUSIONS: These methods
  provide a template for making local and regional heat vulnerability maps. After
  validation using health outcome data, interventions can be targeted at the most
  vulnerable populations.'
