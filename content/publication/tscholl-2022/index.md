abstract: Fine-scale climate information is critical to understand species–climate
  relationships. It is usually obtained by interpolating meteorological station data
  or by downscaling coarse-gridded climate data. In mountain areas, however, the low
  station density and macroclimate variables used in coarse-gridded climate products
  cannot reproduce fine-scale variations caused by the complex topography and thus
  result in biased predictions of species responses to climate change. Here, we present
  an innovative method to estimate daily local air temperature at 100 m spatial resolution
  in the mountain region of South Tyrol (Central Alps, Italy), called the cloud-corrected
  model. We introduce a correction factor that couples solar radiation and cloud cover
  data to improve air temperature predictions. Results are compared to models that
  either consider elevation only (lapse-rate model) or elevation and solar radiation
  but not cloud cover (clear-sky model) using a set of independent meteorological
  stations for validation. Moreover, all models were tested to predict critical phenological
  stages of the climate-sensitive species Vitis vinifera. Over the vegetative period,
  the cloud-corrected model significantly reduced the mean absolute error of predicted
  temperature compared with the lapse rate and clear-sky model by 10 and 23%, respectively,
  and the bias by 93 and 90%, respectively. Solar radiation and cloud cover both strongly
  influenced local air temperature and their inclusion in temperature estimates greatly
  reduced systematic biases and improved predictions of important plant phenological
  stages by multiple days. Our method therefore provides a new way to include easily
  accessible topography and climate data into fine-scale temperature predictions and
  accounts for important climate forcing factors that otherwise are often neglected.
  It combines efficiency and accuracy, because it limits data requirements but still
  operates on an ecologically relevant spatial scale. Thus, our approach offers promising
  opportunities to improve the understanding of species–climate relationships, especially
  in regions sensitive to the effects of climate change.
