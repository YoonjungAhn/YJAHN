abstract: 'Background: Heat warnings are issued in advance of forecast extreme heat
  events, yet little evidence is available regarding their effectiveness in reducing
  heat-related illness and death. We estimated the association of heat warnings and
  advisories (collectively, “alerts”) issued by the United States National Weather
  Service with all-cause mortality and cause-specific hospitalizations among Medicare
  beneficiaries aged 65 years and older in 2,817 counties, 2006–2016. Methods: In
  each county, we compared days with heat alerts to days without heat alerts, matched
  on daily maximum heat index and month. We used conditional Poisson regression models
  stratified on county, adjusting for year, day of week, federal holidays, and lagged
  daily maximum heat index. Results: We identified a matched non-heat alert day for
  92,029 heat alert days in 2,817 counties, or 54.6% of all heat alert days during
  the study period. Contrary to expectations, heat alerts were not associated with
  lower risk of mortality (RR: 1.005 [95% CI: 0.997, 1.013]). However, heat alerts
  were associated with higher risk of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders
  (RR: 1.040 [95% CI: 1.015, 1.065]) and heat stroke (RR: 1.094 [95% CI: 1.038, 1.152]).
  Results were similar in sensitivity analyses additionally adjusting for same-day
  heat index, ozone, and PM2.5. Conclusions: Our results suggest that heat alerts
  are not associated with lower risk of mortality but may be associated with higher
  rates of hospitalization for fluid and electrolyte disorders and heat stroke, potentially
  suggesting that heat alerts lead more individuals to seek or access care.'
