abstract: Extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming more intense, more frequent and
  longer lasting in the 21st century. These events can disproportionately impact the
  health of low-income, minority, and urban populations. To better understand heat-related
  intervention strategies used by four U.S. cities, we conducted 73 semi-structured
  interviews with government and non-governmental organization leaders representing
  public health, general social services, emergency management, meteorology, and the
  environmental planning sectors in Detroit, MI; New York City, NY; Philadelphia,
  PA and Phoenix, AZâ€”cities selected for their diverse demographics, climates, and
  climate adaptation strategies. We identified activities these leaders used to reduce
  the harmful effects of heat for residents in their city, as well as the obstacles
  they faced and the approaches they used to evaluate these efforts. Local leaders
  provided a description of how local context (e.g., climate, governance and city
  structure) impacted heat preparedness. Despite the differences among study cities,
  political will and resource access were critical to driving heat-health related
  programming. Upon completion of our interviews, we convened leaders in each city
  to discuss these findings and their ongoing efforts through day-long workshops.
  Our findings and the recommendations that emerged from these workshops could inform
  other local or national efforts towards preventing heat-related morbidity and mortality.
