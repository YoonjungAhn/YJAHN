abstract: Much of the flood risk faced by coastal and riparian populations worldwide
  is manufactured rather than strictly natural-the outcome of human development projects
  involving municipal growth machines. This paper details the impacts of the hurricane
  of September 1947 on New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, and its relationship
  with the urban development and expansion efforts undertaken during and after the
  Second World War of 1939-45. New Orleans' newest drainage and shipping canals, which
  were a major part of its mid-twentieth century development initiative, funnelled
  the storm surge into the city, a pattern that would repeat itself in subsequent
  years. Unlike more infamous hurricanes, such as Betsy and Katrina of 1965 and 2005,
  respectively, the 1947 event is not well-known among disaster researchers. Yet,
  it provides a fundamental example of how local elites have continuously exacerbated
  flood risk throughout the city and surrounding area, leaving it simultaneously dependent
  on and endangered by its embedded system of drainage and shipping canals.
