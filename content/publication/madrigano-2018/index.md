abstract: 'Preventing heat-related illness and death requires an understanding of
  who is at risk and why, and options for intervention. We sought to understand the
  drivers of socioeconomic disparities in heat-related vulnerability in New York City
  (NYC), the perceived risk of heat exposure and climate change, and barriers to protective
  behaviors. A random digit dial telephone survey of 801 NYC adults aged 18 and older
  was conducted from 22 September‚Åª1 October, 2015. Thirteen percent of the population
  did not possess an air conditioner (AC), and another 15% used AC never/infrequently.
  In adjusted models, odds of not possessing AC were greater for non-Hispanic blacks
  compared with other races/ethnicities, odds ratio (OR) = 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.5),
  and for those with low annual household income, OR = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.8, 5.5). Only
  12% reported going to a public place with AC if they could not keep cool at home.
  While low-income individuals were less likely to be aware of heat warnings, they
  were more likely to be concerned that heat could make them ill and that climate
  change would affect their health than participants with a higher household income,
  OR = 1.6 (95% CI: 1.0, 2.3). In NYC, lack of access to AC partially explains disparities
  in heat-related health outcomes. Our results point to opportunities for knowledge
  building and engagement on heat-health awareness and climate change adaptation that
  can be applied in NYC and other metropolitan areas to improve and target public
  health prevention efforts.'
