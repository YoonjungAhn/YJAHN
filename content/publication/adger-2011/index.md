abstract: This article examines whether some response strategies to climate variability
  and change have the potential to undermine long-term resilience of social-ecological
  systems. We define the parameters of a resilience approach, suggesting that resilience
  is characterized by the ability to absorb perturbations without changing overall
  system function, the ability to adapt within the resources of the system itself,
  and the ability to learn, innovate, and change. We evaluate nine current regional
  climate change policy responses and examine governance, sensitivity to feedbacks,
  and problem framing to evaluate impacts on characteristics of a resilient system.
  We find that some responses, such as the increase in harvest rates to deal with
  pine beetle infestations in Canada and expansion of biofuels globally, have the
  potential to undermine long-term resilience of resource systems. Other responses,
  such as decentralized water planning in Brazil and tropical storm disaster management
  in Caribbean islands, have the potential to increase long-term resilience. We argue
  that there are multiple sources of resilience in most systems and hence policy should
  identify such sources and strengthen capacities to adapt and learn. Â© 2011 John
