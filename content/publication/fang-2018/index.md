abstract: Where do people live, and how has this changed over timescales of centuries?
  High-resolution spatial information on historical human population distribution
  is of great significance to understand human-environment interactions and their
  temporal dynamics. However, the complex relationship between population distribution
  and various influencing factors coupled with limited data availability make it a
  challenge to reconstruct human population distribution over timescales of centuries.
  This study generated 1-km decadal population maps for the conterminous US from 1790
  to 2010 using parsimonious models based on natural suitability, socioeconomic desirability,
  and inhabitability. Five models of increasing complexity were evaluated. The models
  were validated with census tract and county subdivision population data in 2000
  and were applied to generate five sets of 22 historical population maps from 1790-2010.
  Separating urban and rural areas and excluding non-inhabitable areas were the most
  important factors for improving the overall accuracy. The generated gridded population
  datasets and the production and validation methods are described here.
