abstract: The aim of matching spatial data at different map scales is to find corresponding
  objects at different levels of detail (LODs) that represent the same real-world
  phenomena. This is a prerequisite for integrating, evaluating and updating spatial
  data collected and maintained at various scales. However, matching spatial data
  is not straightforward due to the ambiguities caused by problems like many-to-many
  correspondence, non-systematic displacement and different LODs between data sets.
  This paper proposes an approach to matching areal objects (e.g. buildings) based
  on relaxation labeling techniques widely applied in pattern recognition and computer
  vision. The underlying idea is to utilize contextual information (quantified by
  compatibility coefficient) in an iterative process, where the ambiguities are reduced
  until a consistent matching is achieved. This paper describes (1) a domain-specific
  extension to previous relaxation schemes and (2) a new compatibility coefficient
  that exploits relative relationships between areal object pairs in spatial data.
  Our approach were validated through extensive experiments using building data sets
  at 1:10k and 1:50k as an example. Our contextual approach showed superior performance
  against a non-contextual approach in general and especially in ambiguous situations.
  The proposed approach can also be applied to matching other areal features and/or
  for a different scale range. Â© 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and
