abstract: The exponential growth in solar radiation measuring stations across the
  conterminous United States permits the generation of gridded solar irradiance data
  that capture the spatiotemporal variability of solar irradiance far more accurately
  than was previously possible from ground-based observations. Taking advantage of
  these observations, we generated a 30-yr climatology (1991-2020) of mean monthly
  global irradiance at a resolution of 30 arc s (âˆ¼800 m) on both a horizontal surface
  and a sloped ground surface. This paper describes the methods used to generate the
  gridded data, which include extensive quality control of station data, spatial interpolation
  of effective cloud transmittance using the \"PRISM\" method, and simulation of the
  effects of elevation, shading, and reflection from nearby terrain on solar irradiance.
  A comparison of the new dataset with several other solar radiation products reveals
  some spatial features in solar radiation that are either lacking or underresolved
  in some or all of the other datasets. Examples of these features include strong
  gradients near foggy coastlines and along mountain ranges where there is persistent
  orographically driven cloud formation. The workflow developed to create the long-term
  means will be used as a template for generating time series of monthly and daily
  solar radiation grids up to the present.
