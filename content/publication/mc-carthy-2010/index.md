abstract: Urbanisation is estimated to result in 6 billion urban dwellers by 2050.
  Cities will be exposed to climate change from greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing,
  and localised effects from urbanisation such as the urban heat island. An urban
  landsurface model has been included in the HadAM3 Global Climate Model. It shows
  that regions of high population growth coincide with regions of high urban heat
  island potential, most notably in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, and
  East Africa. Climate change has the capacity to modify the climatic potential for
  urban heat islands, with increases of 30% in some locations, but a global average
  reduction of 6%. Warming and extreme heat events due to urbanisation and increased
  energy consumption are simulated to be as large as the impact of doubled CO2 in
  some regions, and climate change increases the disparity in extreme hot nights between
  rural and urban areas. Copyright Â© 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.
