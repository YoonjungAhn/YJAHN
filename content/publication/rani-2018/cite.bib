 abstract = {Rapid growing urban population has resulted in the occupancy of large proportionate of the city and its outskirts, thereby contributing factors to change in the environmental conditions. This has resulted in widespread land acquisition for built up and industrial development, covering the centre of the city while moving at the outskirts of the city as well. Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) changes causes alterations in the land use categories, mostly the concrete forests which has increased the urban temperature as compared to the rural regions due to rapidly growing urbanized environment. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the human-induced environmental phenomenon affecting the urban inhabitant in many ways, such as altering and disturbing the land cover its use which changes thermal energy flow causing elevated surface and air temperature. Temporal satellite datasets (LANDSAT ETM+ image of 1989, 2000 and 2006) can be used to monitor surface temperature while vegetation indices can be used to assess the coverage of the vegetation and non-vegetation area in the region. Temporal NDVI is employed in the study area to analyse the impact of land surface temperature against NDVI in the region. Therefore, temporal remotely sensed data can be used to map LULC and its dynamic changes and other environmental phenomena such as surface temperature over a period of time. Temporal UHI has been estimated using geospatial technology to incorporate it for environmental impact assessment on the surrounding environment. The present research focuses on temporal NDVI and Surface temperature, the methodology used altogether for the assessment of resolution dynamic UHI change on environmental condition for Haridwar district, Uttrakhand India and Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh in India. Both case study has different environmental conditions, geographical locations and demography. Hilly and forested region with almost no industrial activities for Haridwar while several industrial activities and densely populated region Kanpur located in an Indo-Gangetic plain. The research outcome demonstrates the correlation between temporal NDVI and Surface temperature exemplified with case study conducted over two different regions, geographically as well as economically. There is a need to consider the environmental dimension while making progress to urbanization.},
