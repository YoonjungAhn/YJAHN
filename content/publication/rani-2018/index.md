abstract: Rapid growing urban population has resulted in the occupancy of large proportionate
  of the city and its outskirts, thereby contributing factors to change in the environmental
  conditions. This has resulted in widespread land acquisition for built up and industrial
  development, covering the centre of the city while moving at the outskirts of the
  city as well. Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) changes causes alterations in the land
  use categories, mostly the concrete forests which has increased the urban temperature
  as compared to the rural regions due to rapidly growing urbanized environment. Urban
  Heat Island (UHI) is one of the human-induced environmental phenomenon affecting
  the urban inhabitant in many ways, such as altering and disturbing the land cover
  its use which changes thermal energy flow causing elevated surface and air temperature.
  Temporal satellite datasets (LANDSAT ETM+ image of 1989, 2000 and 2006) can be used
  to monitor surface temperature while vegetation indices can be used to assess the
  coverage of the vegetation and non-vegetation area in the region. Temporal NDVI
  is employed in the study area to analyse the impact of land surface temperature
  against NDVI in the region. Therefore, temporal remotely sensed data can be used
  to map LULC and its dynamic changes and other environmental phenomena such as surface
  temperature over a period of time. Temporal UHI has been estimated using geospatial
  technology to incorporate it for environmental impact assessment on the surrounding
  environment. The present research focuses on temporal NDVI and Surface temperature,
  the methodology used altogether for the assessment of resolution dynamic UHI change
  on environmental condition for Haridwar district, Uttrakhand India and Kanpur district,
  Uttar Pradesh in India. Both case study has different environmental conditions,
  geographical locations and demography. Hilly and forested region with almost no
  industrial activities for Haridwar while several industrial activities and densely
  populated region Kanpur located in an Indo-Gangetic plain. The research outcome
  demonstrates the correlation between temporal NDVI and Surface temperature exemplified
  with case study conducted over two different regions, geographically as well as
  economically. There is a need to consider the environmental dimension while making
  progress to urbanization.
