abstract: 'This study objective is to estimate high and low thresholds of the outdoor
  thermal comfort category for different thermal comfort indices in Iran. By using
  a statistical method that considers foure bioclimatic indices: SET*, PT, PET, and
  UTCI, the paper estimates their thermal comfort zone to gauge difference in terms
  of local climate. In this study, 154 stations were selected across the country and
  daily data period from 1995 to 2014 were considered. The results show that the estimated
  thermal comfort zones for the indices studied for Iran are: SET*, from 20.5 (BWh
  or Hot desert climate) to 25.5 °C (BSh or Hot semi-arid climate); PT, from 15.9
  (Cfa or Humid subtropical climate) to 19.1 °C (Aw or Tropical wet and dry); PET,
  from 18.9 (BWh) to 22.5 °C (Aw); and UTCI, from 18.5 (BWh) to 25 °C (Csb or Warm-summer
  Mediterranean climate). A comparison between the original thresholds and estimated
  thresholds of each one of the four indices considered provides an insight to assist
  the future decision making of outdoor activities planning and design.'
