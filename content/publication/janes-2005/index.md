abstract: The case-crossover design has been widely used to study the association
  between short-term air pollution exposure and the risk of an acute adverse health
  event. The design uses cases only; for each individual case, exposure just before
  the event is compared with exposure at other control (or \"referent\") times. Time-invariant
  confounders are controlled by making within-subject comparisons. Even more important
  in the air pollution setting is that time-varying confounders can also be controlled
  by design by matching referents to the index time. The referent selection strategy
  is important for reasons in addition to control of confounding. The case-crossover
  design makes the implicit assumption that there is no trend in exposure across the
  referent times. In addition, the statistical method that is used-conditional logistic
  regression-is unbiased only with certain referent strategies. We review here the
  case-crossover literature in the air pollution context, focusing on key issues regarding
  referent selection. We conclude with a set of recommendations for choosing a referent
  strategy with air pollution exposure data. Specifically, we advocate the time-stratified
  approach to referent selection because it ensures unbiased conditional logistic
  regression estimates, avoids bias resulting from time trend in the exposure series,
  and can be tailored to match on specific time-varying confounders. Copyright Â© 2005
