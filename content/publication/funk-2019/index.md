abstract: Understanding the dynamics and physics of climate extremes will be a critical
  challenge for twenty-first-century climate science. Increasing temperatures and
  saturation vapor pressures may exacerbate heat waves, droughts, and precipitation
  extremes. Yet our ability to monitor temperature variations is limited and declining.
  Between 1983 and 2016, the number of observations in the University of East Anglia
  Climatic Research Unit (CRU) Tmax product declined precipitously (5900 / 1000);
  1000 poorly distributed measurements are insufficient to resolve regional Tmax variations.
  Here, we show that combining long (1983 to the near present), high-resolution (0.058),
  cloud-screened archives of geostationary satellite thermal infrared (TIR) observations
  with a dense set of;15 000 station observations explains 23%, 40%, 30%, 41%, and
  1% more variance than the CRU globally and for South America, Africa, India, and
  areas north of 508N, respectively; even greater levels of improvement are shown
  for the 2011–16 period (28%, 45%, 39%, 52%, and 28%, respectively). Described here
  for the first time, the TIR Tmax algorithm uses subdaily TIR distributions to screen
  out cloud-contaminated observations, providing accurate (correlation'0.8) gridded
  emission Tmax estimates. Blending these gridded fields with;15 000 station observations
  provides a seamless, high-resolution source of accurate Tmax estimates that performs
  well in areas lacking dense in situ observations and even better where in situ observations
  are available. Cross-validation results indicate that the satellite-only, station-only,
  and combined products all perform accurately (R' 0.8–0.9, mean absolute errors'
  0.8–1.0). Hence, the Climate Hazards Center Infrared Temperature with Stations (CHIRTSmax)
  dataset should provide a valuable resource for climate change studies, climate extreme
  analyses, and early warning applications.
