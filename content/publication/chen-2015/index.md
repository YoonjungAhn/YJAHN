abstract: Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change
  studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal
  benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300. m and 1000. m,
  a 30. m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation
  of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be
  captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This
  paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver
  reliable data products.Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to
  cover the entire Earth at 30. m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large
  volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and
  operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and
  thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed
  ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below
  65%) at global scale at 30. m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the
  integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been
  developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge
  strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence
  and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust
  integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the
  quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification
  procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance
  of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes
  from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80% was
  achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and
  feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30. m resolution.
