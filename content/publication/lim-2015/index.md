abstract: 'Research has shown that diurnal temperature range (DTR) is significantly
  associated with mortality and morbidity in regions of Asia; however, few studies
  have been conducted in other regions such as North America. Thus, we examined DTR
  effects on mortality in the USA. We used mortality and environmental data from the
  National Morbidity Mortality Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS). The data are daily mortality,
  air pollution, and temperature statistics from 95 large US communities collected
  between 1987 and 2000. To assess community-specific DTR effects on mortality, we
  used Poisson generalized linear models allowing for over-dispersion. After assessing
  community-specific DTR effects on mortality, we estimated region- and age-specific
  effects of DTR using two-level normal independent sampling estimation. We found
  a significant increase of 0.27 % [95 % confidence intervals (CI), 0.24–0.30 %] in
  nonaccidental mortality across 95 communities in the USA associated with a 1 °C
  increase in DTR, controlling for apparent temperature, day of the week, and time
  trend. This overall effect was driven mainly by effects of DTR on cardiovascular
  and respiratory mortality in the elderly: Mortality in the above 65 age group increased
  by 0.39 % (95 % CI, 0.33–0.44 %) and 0.33 % (95 % CI, 0.22–0.44 %), respectively.
  We found some evidence of regional differences in the effects of DTR on nonaccidental
  mortality with the highest effects in Southern California [0.31 % (95 % CI, 0.21–0.42 %)]
  and smallest effects in the Northwest and Upper Midwest regions [0.22 % (95 % CI,
  0.11–0.33 %) and 0.22 % (95 % CI, 0.07–0.37 %), respectively]. These results indicate
  a statistically significant association between DTR and mortality on average for
  95 large US communities. The findings indicate that DTR impacts on nonaccidental
  and cardiovascular-related mortality in most US regions and the elderly population
  was most vulnerable to the effects of DTR.'
