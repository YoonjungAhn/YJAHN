abstract: 'Background: Childhood growth is a cornerstone of pediatric research. Statistical
  models need to consider individual trajectories to adequately describe growth outcomes.
  Specifically, well-defined longitudinal models are essential to characterize both
  population and subject-specific growth. Linear mixed-effect models with cubic regression
  splines can account for the nonlinearity of growth curves and provide reasonable
  estimators of population and subject-specific growth, velocity and acceleration.
  Methods: We provide a stepwise approach that builds from simple to complex models,
  and account for the intrinsic complexity of the data. We start with standard cubic
  splines regression models and build up to a model that includes subject-specific
  random intercepts and slopes and residual autocorrelation. We then compared cubic
  regression splines vis-à-vis linear piecewise splines, and with varying number of
  knots and positions. Statistical code is provided to ensure reproducibility and
  improve dissemination of methods. Models are applied to longitudinal height measurements
  in a cohort of 215 Peruvian children followed from birth until their fourth year
  of life. Results: Unexplained variability, as measured by the variance of the regression
  model, was reduced from 7.34 when using ordinary least squares to 0.81 (p < 0.001)
  when using a linear mixed-effect models with random slopes and a first order continuous
  autoregressive error term. There was substantial heterogeneity in both the intercept
  (p < 0.001) and slopes (p < 0.001) of the individual growth trajectories. We also
  identified important serial correlation within the structure of the data (ρ = 0.66;
  95 % CI 0.64 to 0.68; p < 0.001), which we modeled with a first order continuous
  autoregressive error term as evidenced by the variogram of the residuals and by
  a lack of association among residuals. The final model provides a parametric linear
  regression equation for both estimation and prediction of population- and individual-level
  growth in height. We show that cubic regression splines are superior to linear regression
  splines for the case of a small number of knots in both estimation and prediction
  with the full linear mixed effect model (AIC 19,352 vs. 19,598, respectively). While
  the regression parameters are more complex to interpret in the former, we argue
  that inference for any problem depends more on the estimated curve or differences
  in curves rather than the coefficients. Moreover, use of cubic regression splines
  provides biological meaningful growth velocity and acceleration curves despite increased
  complexity in coefficient interpretation. Conclusions: Through this stepwise approach,
  we provide a set of tools to model longitudinal childhood data for non-statisticians
  using linear mixed-effect models.'
