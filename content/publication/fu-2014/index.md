abstract: 'Smartphone users are increasingly using apps that can access their location.
  Often these accesses can be without users knowledge and consent. For example, recent
  research has shown that installation-time capability disclosures are ineffective
  in informing people about their apps’ location access. In this paper, we present
  a four-week field study (N=22) on run-time location access disclosures. Towards
  this end, we implemented a novel method to disclose location accesses by location-enabled
  apps on participants’ smartphones. In particular, the method did not need any changes
  to participants’ phones beyond installing our study app. We randomly divided our
  participants to two groups: a Disclosure group (N=13), who received our disclosures
  and a No Disclosure group (N=9) who received no disclosures from us. Our results
  confirm that the Android platform’s location access disclosure method does not inform
  participants effectively. Almost all participants pointed out that their location
  was accessed by several apps they would have not expected to access their location.
  Further, several apps accessed their location more frequently than they expected.
  We conclude that our participants appreciated the transparency brought by our run-time
  disclosures and that because of the disclosures most of them had taken actions to
  manage their apps’ location access.'
