abstract: Monitoring of air quality is demanding, especially in poor air quality regions.
  China has been suffering from PM2.5 pollution associated with the fast urbanization
  and economic productivity. The purpose of this work is to analyze PM2.5 with regard
  to air quality for five populated cities (Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai
  and Shenyang) of China. In this study, hourly concentration of PM2.5 is decomposed
  into annual and seasonal concentrations and is evaluated. The results show the downward
  trend of PM2.5 for Beijing and Chengdu from 2013 to 2016 and for Guangzhou from
  2012 to 2016, but no clear trend is observed for Shanghai and Shenyang. Although
  trend is decreasing for three cities (Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou), but overall
  annual average is found higher than the annual U.S. national ambient air quality
  standards for PM2.5. Among all five cities, highest annual PM2.5 concentration is
  found to be 104.1 µgm−3for Beijing in 2010 and lowest (32.6 µgm−3) is found for
  Guangzhou in 2016. The diurnal variation is high during night for Beijing, Guangzhou
  and Shanghai and it is high after morning rush hours for Chengdu and Shenyang (during
  April 2008–June 2017), respectively. In all studied sites, the seasonal variability
  is found highest in winter and lowest in the summer. Due to more contribution from
  biomass burning and dust, high PM2.5 variation is also found in the autumn and spring,
  respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study for Guangzhou,
  Chengdu and Shenyang that explores PM2.5 concentration for 5 years.
