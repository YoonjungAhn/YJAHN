abstract: Observations of daily surface solar or shortwave radiation data from over
  4000 stations have been gathered, covering much of the continental United States
  as well as portions of Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. The quantity of data
  increases almost linearly from 1998, when only several hundred stations had data.
  A quality-control procedure utilizing threshold values along with computing the
  clear-sky radiation envelope for individual stations was implemented to both screen
  bad data and rescue informative data. Over two-thirds of the observations are seen
  as acceptable. There are 15 different surface solar radiation products assessed
  relative to observations, including reanalyses [Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR),
  CFS Reanalysis and Reforecast (CFSRR), ERA-Interim, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis
  Project (JRA-55), MERRA, NARR, and NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis 1 (NCEP-1)], derived products
  [observations from the CRU and NCEP-1 (CRU-NCEP); Daily Surface Weather and Climatological
  Summaries (Daymet); Global Land Data Assimilation System, version 1 (GLDAS-1); Global
  Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3); Multiscale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model
  Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP); and phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation
  System (NLDAS-2)], and two satellite products (CERES and GOES). All except the CERES
  product have daily or finer temporal resolution. The RMSE of spatial biases is greater
  than 18 W m 22 for 13 of the 15 products over the summer season (June-August). None
  of the daily resolution products fulfill all three desirable criteria of low (,5%)
  annual or seasonal bias, high correlation with observed cloudiness, and correct
  distribution of clear-sky radiation. Some products display vestiges of underlying
  algorithm issues [e.g., from the Mountain Microclimate Simulation Model, version
  4.3 (MTCLIM 4.3)] or bias-correction methods. A new bias-correction method is introduced
  that preserves clear-sky radiation values and better replicates cloudiness statistics.
  The current quantity of data over the continental United States suggests that a
  solar radiation product based on, or enhanced with, observations is feasible.
