abstract: 'BACKGROUND Days of extreme temperature may be associated with transiently
  higher risk of preterm birth, but prior studies have been limited and results have
  been heterogeneous.   OBJECTIVES To evaluate the association between days of extreme
  heat and cold and risk of preterm birth among ~32 million live singleton births
  between 1989 and 2002 across 403 counties in the contiguous United States (US).   METHODS
  We used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate the association between population-weighted
  daily mean temperature and risk of preterm birth in each county and then pooled
  results across geographic regions and climate zones. We defined extreme heat and
  cold as the 95th and 5th percentile of the county-specific temperatures, respectively.   RESULTS
  Preterm birth accounted for 9.3% of deliveries. There was a monotonic association
  between ambient temperature and risk of preterm birth. Days of extreme heat and
  cold were associated with a relative risk of preterm birth of 1.025 (95% CI: 1.015,
  1.036) and 0.985 (95% CI: 0.976, 0.993) over the subsequent four days, respectively,
  relative to the county-specific median temperature. If causal, the fraction of preterm
  births attributable to extreme heat was 0.17% (empirical 95% CI: 0.14%, 0.19%),
  corresponding to 154 (empirical 95% CI: 127, 173) preterm births per million births.
  Extreme heat was more strongly associated with preterm birth in regions with colder
  and drier climates, and among younger women. Days of extreme cold temperature were
  associated with lower rather than higher risk of preterm birth.   CONCLUSIONS Days
  of extreme heat, but not extreme cold, are associated with higher risk of preterm
  birth in the contiguous US. If causal, these results may have important implications
  for the management of pregnant women during forecasted periods of extreme heat.'
