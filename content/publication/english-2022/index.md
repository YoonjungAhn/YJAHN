abstract: Recent advances in computing technologies have enabled the development of
  low-cost, compact weather and air quality monitors. The U.S. federally funded Array
  of Things (AoT) project has deployed more than 140 such sensor nodes throughout
  the City of Chicago. This article combines a yearâ€™s worth of AoT sensor data with
  household data collected from 450 elderly Chicagoans in order to explore the feasibility
  of using previously unavailable data on local environmental conditions to improve
  traditional neighborhood research. Specifically, we pilot the use of AoT sensor
  data to overcome limitations in research linking air pollution to poor physical
  and mental health and find support for recent findings that exposure to pollutants
  contributes to both respiratory- and dementia-related diseases. We expect that this
  support will become even stronger as sensing technologies continue to improve and
  more AoT nodes come online, enabling additional applications to social science research
  where environmental context matters.
