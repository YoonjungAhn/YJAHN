abstract: 'Using air purifiers is an intervention to reduce exposure to fine particulate
  matter (PM2.5) for health benefits. We performed a comprehensive simulation in urban
  China to estimate the cost-effectiveness of long-term use of air purifiers to remove
  indoor PM2.5 from indoor and ambient air pollution in five intervention scenarios
  (S1-S5), where the indoor PM2.5 targets were 35, 25, 15, 10, and 5 Î¼g/m3, respectively.
  In scenarios S1 to S5, 5221 (95% uncertainty interval: 3886-6091), 6178 (4554-7242),
  8599 (6255-10,109), 11,006 (7962-13,013), and 14,990 (10,888-17,610) thousand disability-adjusted-life-years
  (DALYs) can be avoided at the cost of 201 (199-204), 240 (238-243), 364 (360-369),
  522 (515-530), and 921 (905-939) billion Chinese Yuan (CNY), respectively. A high
  disparity in per capita health benefits and costs was observed by city, which expanded
  with the decrease of the indoor PM2.5 target. The net benefits of using purifiers
  in cities varied across scenarios. Cities with a lower ratio of annual average outdoor
  PM2.5 concentration to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita tended to achieve
  higher net benefits in the scenario with a lower indoor PM2.5 target. Controlling
  ambient PM2.5 pollution and developing the economy can reduce the inequality in
  air purifier use across China.'
