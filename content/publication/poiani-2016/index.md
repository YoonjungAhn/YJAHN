abstract: In the aftermath of a disaster, there is an urgent need for base maps to
  support relief efforts, especially in developing countries. In response to this,
  the OpenStreetMap project has been leveraged to produce maps of disaster-affected
  areas in a collaborative way. However, there has been little investigation aimed
  at explaining the collaborative mapping activity itself. This study presents an
  exploratory case study on how the collaborative mapping activities that followed
  the Nepal Earthquake in 2015 were coordinated and structured, i.e. how volunteers
  were organized, and what were the main outcomes of their activity in the context
  of disaster management. The results show that a large number of remote contributors
  spread across the world carried out concerted efforts to support the relief work.
  Moreover, coordination mechanisms were used by local actors to share their knowledge
  with remote mappers, and, hence, to improve the accuracy of the map.
