abstract: "stakeholders such as occupational health and safety professionals (HSPs)
  on injury risk factors during hot weather may assist in informing injury prevention
  efforts. Methods A national online survey of HSPs was undertaken. Collected data
  included perspectives on injury experiences, current preventive measures, training,
  policies and guidelines, and barriers for prevention. Results were analyzed descriptively
  and a log-poisson regression was used to identify risk factors associated with reported
  injuries during hot weather at workplaces the HSPs visited/managed. Results In total
  there were 307 respondents, the majority of who acknowledged the potential for increased
  risk of occupational injuries in hot weather. A variety of injury types and mechanisms
  were reported, including manual handling injuries, hand injuries, wounds or lacerations
  and loss of control of power tools. Work factors significantly associated with reported
  injuries included problems with personal protective equipment; lack of shade; inadequate
  hydration and rest breaks, and problems with supervision. Less than half (42%) of
  HSPs stated the availability of adequate heat training for staff and 54% reported
  the provision for outdoor work to cease if temperatures are extreme as a preventive
  measure in workplaces they visited/managed. HSPs recommended 'heat stress training'
  as the most important preventive measure for outdoor and indoor workers. Reported
  barriers for prevention include: lack of awareness by workers and supervisors of
  injury risks, and management concerns about productivity loss and/or deadlines.
  Conclusion These findings point to a range of modifiable work and organisational
  risk factors for injury during hot weather. More attention to these factors, in
  conjunction with traditional interventions for heat-induced illness, could enhance
  injury prevention in the workplace. Recent global analysis of current and future
  ambient heat conditions has shown that occupational heat exposure in Pacific countries,
  measured or projected as WBGT, is among the most extreme in the world. Many Pacific
  countries face a serious and unprecedented collision of adverse environmental, sociocultural/demographic
  and chronic health factors. Environmentally , high temperatures and humidity exist
  several months each year, reducing physical work capacity. Conservative assessments
  reveal annual loss of healthy work hours for a person working at 400 W metabolic
  rate in countries like Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Nauru and Guam increasing from
  2%-3% to 9%-18% by 2100, based on the RCP6.0 pathway for climate change. Socio-culturally,
  such countries have low average income levels and high reliance on primary industries,
  so occupational and domestic exposure to ambient heat is chronic and somewhat intractable.
  Health wise, such countries have among the highest burden of chronic cardiometabolic
  disease in the world. Diabetes is already prevalent (20%-35%), as is hypertension.
  Casual links between heat exposure and cardiovascular health problems is strengthening
  and these health problems are becoming a major threat to health in Pacific countries.
  A diet that is increasingly more divergent from traditional foods is one key factor,
  but increasing heat conditions will contribute, particularly for people working
  in physically intensive occupations. Obesity is also prevalent, which is relevant
  because it adds to heat production while concurrently reducing heat loss, thereby
  impairing work capacity and tolerance of humid heat. Collectively these factors
  compromise thermal tolerance, reduce functional capacity and contribute to cardiometabolic
  disease. This paper will analyse the physiological base for the heat effects on
  cardiovascu-lar disease with particular reference to occupational heat exposure,
  and estimate the impacts of climate change in the Pacific countries as well as identify
  solutions to reduce the future impacts. Exposure to extreme heat negatively affects
  occupational health. Heat stress indices like Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)
  combine temperature and humidity and allow quantifying the climatic impact on human
  physiology and clinical health. Multi-day periods of high heat stress (aka. heat
  waves) affect occupational health and productivity independently from the absolute
  temperature levels; e.g. well-documented heatwaves in Europe caused disruption,
  hospitalisations and deaths (2003 French heat wave: more than 1000 extra deaths,
  15-65 years, mainly men) even though the temperatures were within the normal range
  of hotter countries. Climate change is likely to increase frequency and severity
  of periods of high heat stress. However, current global grid-cell based climate
  models are not designed to predict heat waves, neither in terms of severity or frequency.
  By analysing 37 years of historic daily heat index data from almost 5000 global
  weather stations and comparing them to widely used grid-cell based climate model
  outputs over the same period, our research explores methods to assess the frequency
  and intensity of heat waves as well as the associated occupational health effects
  at any location around the world in the future. Weather station temperature extreme
  values (WBGT) for the 3 hottest days in 30 years exceed the mean WBGT of the hottest
  month calculated from climate models in the same grid-cell by about 2 degrees in
  the tropics but by 10 degrees at higher latitudes in temperate climate regions.
  Our model based on the relationship between actual recorded periods of elevated
  heat-stress and grid-cell based climate projections, in combination with population
  and employment projections, can quantify national and regional productivity loss
  and health effects with greater certainty than is currently the case."
