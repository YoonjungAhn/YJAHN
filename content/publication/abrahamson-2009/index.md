abstract: "BackgroundMost projections of climate change suggest an increased frequency
  of heatwaves in England over coming decades; older people are at particular risk.
  This could result in substantial mortality and morbidity.ObjectiveTo determine elderly
  people's knowledge and perceptions of heat-related risks to health, and of protective
  behaviours.MethodsSemi-structured interviews: 73 men and women, 72-94 years, living
  in their own homes in London and Norwich, UK.ResultsFew respondents considered themselves
  either old or at risk from the effects of heat, even though many had some form of
  relevant chronic illness; they did recognize that some medical conditions might
  increase risks in others. Most reported that they had taken appropriate steps to
  reduce the effects of heat. Some respondents considered it appropriate for the government
  to take responsibility for protecting vulnerable people, but many thought state
  intervention was unnecessary, intrusive and unlikely to be effective. Respondents
  were more positive about the value of appropriately disseminated advice and solutions
  by communities themselves.ConclusionThe Heatwave Plan should consider giving greater
  emphasis to a population-based information strategy, using innovative information
  dissemination methods to increase awareness of vulnerability to heat among the elderly
  and to ensure clarity about behaviour modification measures."
