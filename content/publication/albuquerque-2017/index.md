abstract: "This study used real data from a Brazilian financial institution on transactions
  involving Consumer Direct Credit (CDC), granted to clients residing in the Distrito
  Federal (DF), to construct credit scoring models via Logistic Regression and Geographically
  Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) techniques. The aims were: to verify whether
  the factors that influence credit risk differ according to the borrower's geographic
  location; to compare the set of models estimated via GWLR with the global model
  estimated via Logistic Regression, in terms of predictive power and financial losses
  for the institution; and to verify the viability of using the GWLR technique to
  develop credit scoring models. The metrics used to compare the models developed
  via the two techniques were the AICc informational criterion, the accuracy of the
  models, the percentage of false positives, the sum of the value of false positive
  debt, and the expected monetary value of portfolio default compared with the monetary
  value of defaults observed. The models estimated for each region in the DF were
  distinct in their variables and coefficients (parameters), with it being concluded
  that credit risk was influenced differently in each region in the study. The Logistic
  Regression and GWLR methodologies presented very close results, in terms of predictive
  power and financial losses for the institution, and the study demonstrated viability
  in using the GWLR technique to develop credit scoring models for the target population
  in the study."
