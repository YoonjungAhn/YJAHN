 abstract = {This study used real data from a Brazilian financial institution on transactions involving Consumer Direct Credit (CDC), granted to clients residing in the Distrito Federal (DF), to construct credit scoring models via Logistic Regression and Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) techniques. The aims were: to verify whether the factors that influence credit risk differ according to the borrower's geographic location; to compare the set of models estimated via GWLR with the global model estimated via Logistic Regression, in terms of predictive power and financial losses for the institution; and to verify the viability of using the GWLR technique to develop credit scoring models. The metrics used to compare the models developed via the two techniques were the AICc informational criterion, the accuracy of the models, the percentage of false positives, the sum of the value of false positive debt, and the expected monetary value of portfolio default compared with the monetary value of defaults observed. The models estimated for each region in the DF were distinct in their variables and coefficients (parameters), with it being concluded that credit risk was influenced differently in each region in the study. The Logistic Regression and GWLR methodologies presented very close results, in terms of predictive power and financial losses for the institution, and the study demonstrated viability in using the GWLR technique to develop credit scoring models for the target population in the study.},
