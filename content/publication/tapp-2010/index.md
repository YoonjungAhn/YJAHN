abstract: This research contributes to the body of literature on areal interpolation
  and dasymetric mapping by introducing algorithms that make use of local ancillary
  data sources. The address weighting (AVV) and parcel distribution (PD) methods are
  based on county address points and parcels. The algorithms can be effectively applied
  in rural and transitional areas where geographies are large and population counts
  are low. These new methods were compared to existing algorithms that use nationally
  available land cover and street network datasets. Compared with existing methods,
  the new methods yielded significant improvement in reducing estimate error for the
  study areas. Both new methods succeeded in maintaining high accuracy in both urban
  and rural areas. The research presents opportunities for increasing the accuracy
  of both areal interpolation and dasymetric mapping in areas where accurate local
  data are available.
