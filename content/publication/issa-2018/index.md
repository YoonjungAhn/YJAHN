abstract: Three powerful and devastating hurricanes from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane
  season (Harvey [August 17-September 1], Irma [August 30-September 13], and Maria
  [September 16-October 2]) resulted in the deaths of hundreds of persons. Disaster-related
  mortality surveillance is critical to an emergency response because it provides
  government and public health officials with information about the scope of the disaster
  and topics for prevention messaging. CDC's Emergency Operations Center collaborated
  with state health departments in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina to collect
  and analyze Hurricane Irma-related mortality data to understand the main circumstances
  of death. The most common circumstance-of-death categories were exacerbation of
  existing medical conditions and power outage. Further analysis revealed two unique
  subcategories of heat-related and oxygen-dependent deaths in which power outage
  contributed to exacerbation of an existing medical condition. Understanding the
  need for subcategorization of disaster-related circumstances of death and the possibility
  of overlapping categories can help public health practitioners derive more effective
  public health interventions to prevent deaths in future disasters.
