abstract: Conducting temporal analysis of census data often requires applying areal
  interpolation to integrate data that have been spatially aggregated using incompatible
  zoning systems. This article introduces a method of areal interpolation, target-density
  weight-ing (TDW), that is useful for long-term temporal analysis because it requires
  only readily available historical data and basic geographic information system operations.
  Then, through regression analysis of a large sample of U.S. census tract data, a
  model is produced that relates the error in TDW estimates of tract population to
  four basic properties of tracts. An analysis of model residuals combined with theorized
  absolute limits on interpolation error yields formulas with which we can compute
  upper and lower prediction bounds on the population in a tract of one census at
  the time of a different census. These prediction intervals enable the interpretation
  of different interpolated estimates with appropriately varying degrees of uncertainty.
