abstract: Roadway design aims to maximize functionality, safety, and longevity. The
  materials used for construction, however, are often selected on the assumption of
  a stationary climate. Anthropogenic climate change may therefore result in rapid
  infrastructure failure and, consequently, increased maintenance costs, particularly
  for paved roads where temperature is a key determinant for material selection. Here,
  we examine the economic costs of projected temperature changes on asphalt roads
  across the contiguous United States using an ensemble of 19 global climate models
  forced with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Over the past 20 years, stationary assumptions
  have resulted in incorrect material selection for 35% of 799 observed locations.
  With warming temperatures, maintaining the standard practice for material selection
  is estimated to add approximately US$13.6, US$19.0 and US$21.8 billion to pavement
  costs by 2010, 2040 and 2070 under RCP4.5, respectively, increasing to US$14.5,
  US$26.3 and US$35.8 for RCP8.5. These costs will disproportionately affect local
  municipalities that have fewer resources to mitigate impacts. Failing to update
  engineering standards of practice in light of climate change therefore significantly
  threatens pavement infrastructure in the United States.
