abstract: The problem of testing smooth components of an extended generalized additive
  model for equality to zero is considered. Confidence intervals for such components
  exhibit good across-the-function coverage probabilities if based on the approximate
  result, where f is the vector of evaluated values for the smooth component of interest
  and V f is the covariance matrix for f according to the Bayesian view of the smoothing
  process. Based on this result, a Wald-type test of f=0 is proposed. It is shown
  that care must be taken in selecting the rank used in the test statistic. The method
  complements previous work by extending applicability beyond the Gaussian case, while
  considering tests of zero effect rather than testing the parametric hypothesis given
  by the null space of the component's smoothing penalty. The proposed p-values are
  routine and efficient to compute from a fitted model, without requiring extra model
  fits or null distribution simulation. Â© 2012 Biometrika Trust.
