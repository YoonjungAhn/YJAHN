abstract: Street trees are often unequally distributed in urban areas, and their physical
  and structural attributes, such as extent of canopy cover, species composition,
  and size distribution, are also spatially heterogeneous. Some studies report that
  inequalities are more prevalent in streetscapes than in private landscapes. Considering
  the existing inequality issues and public nature of street trees, street tree inequality
  studies warrant greater attention. However, most existing studies in this field
  focus heavily on the unequal distribution of tree canopy cover, while disregarding
  other tree attributes. In this study, seven street tree measures covering tree abundance,
  species diversity, and size structure were derived from high-resolution satellite
  images, Google Street View, and street tree census. We then applied the geographically
  weighted regression to these seven tree measures in New York City, United States,
  compared street tree inequalities among different socioeconomic groups, and identified
  inequality hotspots. Our results show that street tree inequalities are greatest
  with respect to tree abundance and species diversity. Furthermore, race-based and
  education-based inequalities are most notable, and age-, income-, and household
  characteristic-based inequalities were also detected based on tree abundance or
  species diversity. Socially vulnerable areas that suffer the most severe inequalities
  are clustered in Brooklyn and Queens. Disaggregated street tree inequalities, with
  explicit recognition of the differentiated distribution of limited tree resources
  among different social groups and across geographical areas, are critical for effective
  decision-making to alleviate environmental inequities.
