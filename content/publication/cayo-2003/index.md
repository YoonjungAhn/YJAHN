abstract: 'Background: Public health applications using geographic information system
  (GIS) technology are steadily increasing. Many of these rely on the ability to locate
  where people live with respect to areas of exposure from environmental contaminants.
  Automated geocoding is a method used to assign geographic coordinates to an individual
  based on their street address. This method often relies on street centerline files
  as a geographic reference. Such a process introduces positional error in the geocoded
  point. Our study evaluated the positional error caused during automated geocoding
  of residential addresses and how this error varies between population densities.
  We also evaluated an alternative method of geocoding using residential property
  parcel data.'
