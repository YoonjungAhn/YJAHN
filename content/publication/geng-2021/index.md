abstract: <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 33 million confirmed cases
  and over 1 million deaths globally, as of 1 October 2020. During the lockdown and
  restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become
  one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because
  of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual
  wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 and government response policies
  to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses
  the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily
  from Googleâ€™s Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response
  Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park
  visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior
  to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure
  of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to
  parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively
  associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and
  outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the
  important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks,
  under the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other
  decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as
  well as for park design and development. In particular, parks could be utilized
  during pandemics to increase the physical and mental health and social well-being
  of individuals.</p>
