abstract: High temperatures and heat waves are related but not synonymous concepts.
  Heat waves, generally understood to be acute periods of extreme warmth, are relevant
  to a wide range of stakeholders because of the impacts that these events have on
  human health and activities and on natural environments. Perhaps because of the
  diversity of communities engaged in heat wave monitoring and research, there is
  no single, standard definition of a heat wave. Experts differ in which threshold
  values (absolute versus relative), duration and ancillary variables to incorporate
  into heat wave definitions. While there is value in this diversity of perspectives,
  the lack of a unified index can cause confusion when discussing patterns, trends,
  and impacts. Here, we use data from the North American Land Data Assimilation System
  to examine patterns and trends in 15 previously published heat wave indices for
  the period 1979-2011 across the Continental United States. Over this period the
  Southeast region saw the highest number of heat wave days for the majority of indices
  considered. Positive trends (increases in number of heat wave days per year) were
  greatest in the Southeast and Great Plains regions, where more than 12 % of the
  land area experienced significant increases in the number of heat wave days per
  year for the majority of heat wave indices. Significant negative trends were relatively
  rare, but were found in portions of the Southwest, Northwest, and Great Plains.
