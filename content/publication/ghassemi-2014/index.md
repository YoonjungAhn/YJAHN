abstract: 'Background: Observational studies have found an increased risk of adverse
  effects such as hemorrhage, stroke, and increased mortality in patients taking selective
  serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The impact of prior use of these medications
  on outcomes in critically ill patients has not been previously examined. We performed
  a retrospective study to determine if preadmission use of SSRIs or serotonin norepinephrine
  reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) is associated with mortality differences in patients
  admitted to the ICU. Methods: The retrospective study used a modifiable data mining
  technique applied to the publicly available Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring
  in Intensive Care (MIMIC) 2.6 database. A total of 14,709 patient records, consisting
  of 2,471 in the SSRI/SNRI group and 12,238 control subjects, were analyzed. The
  study outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: After adjustment for age, Simplified
  Acute Physiology Score, vasopressor use, ventilator use, and combined Elixhauser
  score, SSRI/SNRI use was associated with significantly increased in-hospital mortality
  (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.40; P = .026). Among patient subgroups, risk was highest
  in patients with acute coronary syndrome (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.21-3.13; P = .006)
  and patients admitted to the cardiac surgery recovery unit (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.04;
  P = .008). Mortality appeared to vary by specific SSRI, with higher mortalities
  associated with higher levels of serotonin inhibition. Conclusions: We found significant
  increases in hospital stay mortality among those patients in the ICU taking SSRI/SNRIs
  prior to admission as compared with control subjects. Mortality was higher in patients
  receiving SSRI/SNRI agents that produce greater degrees of serotonin reuptake inhibition.
  The study serves to demonstrate the potential for the future application of advanced
  data examination techniques upon detailed (and growing) clinical databases being
  made available by the digitization of medicine. Â© 2014 American College of Chest
