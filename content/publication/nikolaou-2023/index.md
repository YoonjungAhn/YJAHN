abstract: The commonly used weather stations cannot fully capture the spatiotemporal
  variability of near-surface air temperature (Tair), leading to exposure misclassification
  and biased health effect estimates. We aimed to improve the spatiotemporal coverage
  of Tair data in Germany by using multi-stage modeling to estimate daily 1 × 1 km
  minimum (Tmin), mean (Tmean), maximum (Tmax) Tair and diurnal Tair range during
  2000–2020. We used weather station Tair observations, satellite-based land surface
  temperature (LST), elevation, vegetation and various land use predictors. In the
  first stage, we built a linear mixed model with daily random intercepts and slopes
  for LST adjusted for several spatial predictors to estimate Tair from cells with
  both Tair and LST available. In the second stage, we used this model to predict
  Tair for cells with only LST available. In the third stage, we regressed the second
  stage predictions against interpolated Tair values to obtain Tair countrywide. All
  models achieved high accuracy (0.91 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.98) and low errors (1.03 °C ≤ Root
  Mean Square Error (RMSE) ≤ 2.02 °C). Validation with external data confirmed the
  good performance, locally, i.e., in Augsburg for all models (0.74 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99, 0.87
  °C ≤ RMSE ≤ 2.05 °C) and countrywide, for the Tmean model (0.71 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.99, 0.79
  °C ≤ RMSE ≤ 1.19 °C). Annual Tmean averages ranged from 8.56 °C to 10.42 °C with
  the years beyond 2016 being constantly hotter than the 21-year average. The spatial
  variability within Germany exceeded 15 °C annually on average following patterns
  including mountains, rivers and urbanization. Using a case study, we showed that
  modeling leads to broader Tair variability representation for exposure assessment
  of participants in health cohorts. Our results indicate the proposed models as suitable
  for estimating nationwide Tair at high resolution. Our product is critical for temperature-based
  epidemiological studies and is also available for other research purposes.
