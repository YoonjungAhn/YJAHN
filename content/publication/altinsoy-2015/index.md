abstract: Occupational fatalities and work-related injuries are more common in Turkey
  than in most developing and developed countries. Several precautions have been taken
  concerning the matter, and The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSL 2012) has
  been passed. These efforts, however, have failed to incorporate in their framework
  the role of global warming. New legislation is underway for the prevention of occupational
  diseases , injuries, and fatalities. This is particularly worrisome given that Turkey
  is in the forefront of countries projected to be affected seriously by climate change.
  Consequently, a study on the direct and indirect impact of climate change on workers'
  health and labour productivity is paramount. The main purpose of this research is
  to present diminishing labour productivity as a consequence of decreased working
  hours via an estimate of rest hours of workers in manual labour. The climatic outputs
  of Regional Climate Model (RegCM3) obtained from the ENSEMBLES Project are used
  to calculate the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) over western Turkey. The study
  covers the span of years between 1971 and 2100. Moreover, spatial distributions
  of observed domain are estimated by means of a seasonal analysis, preliminary to
  a more detailed research. Critical regions, more adversely influenced than others,
  are identified. The total number of loss days for these critical regions are presented
  for various time periods. As a result, labour productivity particularly in agriculture
  and construction is expected to diminish seriously over Central Anatolia, Cyprus,
  and parts of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean coastal areas. Between 2071 and
  2100, deficiency in labour productivity may reach up to 52 % during the summer across
  some of these critical regions. Though it will be seen that the present study has
  focused primarily on manual labour and outdoor work in particular, it foreshadows
  nevertheless the dangerous impact of climate change on occupational health and labour
  productivity in general.
