abstract: From Hurricane Katrina and the south Asian tsunami to human-induced atrocities,
  terrorist attacks and the looming effects of climate change, the world is assailed
  by both natural and unnatural hazards and disasters. These expose not only human
  vulnerability - particularly that of the poorest, who are least able to respond
  and adapt - but also the profound worldwide environmental injustices that result
  from the geographical distribution of risks, hazards and disasters. This collection
  of essays, from one of the most renowned and experienced experts, provides a timely
  assessment of these critical themes. Presenting the top selections from Susan L.
  Cutter's thirty years of scholarship on hazards, vulnerability and environmental
  justice, the volume tackles issues such as nuclear and toxic hazards, risk assessment,
  communication and planning, and societal responses. Cutter maps out the terrain
  and draws out the salient themes with a fresh, powerful introduction written in
  the wake of her work in the aftermath of Katrina. This essential collection is ideal
  for professionals, researchers, academics and students working on hazards, risk,
  disasters and environmental justice across a range of disciplines.
