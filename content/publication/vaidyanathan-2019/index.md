abstract: Heat early warning systems and action plans use temperature thresholds to
  trigger warnings and risk communication. In this study, we conduct multistate analyses,
  exploring associations between heat and all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations,
  to inform the design and development of heat-health early warning systems. We used
  a two-stage analysis to estimate heat-health risk relationships between heat index
  and hospitalizations in 1,617 counties in the United States for 2003-2012. The first
  stage involved a county-level time series quasi-Poisson regression, using a distributed
  lag nonlinear model, to estimate heat-health associations. The second stage involved
  a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to pool county-specific exposure-response
  associations across larger geographic scales, such as by state or climate region.
  Using results from this two-stage analysis, we identified heat index ranges that
  correspond with significant heat-attributable burden. We then compared those with
  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service (NWS)
  heat alert criteria used during the same time period. Associations between heat
  index and cause-specific hospitalizations vary widely by geography and health outcome.
  Heat-attributable burden starts to occur at moderately hot heat index values, which
  in some regions are below the alert ranges used by the NWS during the study time
  period. Locally specific health evidence can beneficially inform and calibrate heat
  alert criteria. A synchronization of health findings with traditional weather forecasting
  efforts could be critical in the development of effective heat-health early warning
  systems. public health | extreme heat | public policy | evidence-based decision
  making | early warning systems E xtreme heat is an established hazard. Risk for
  a range of conditions is associated with extreme heat exposure (1, 2), including
  morbidity from heat illness (3), electrolyte and renal dysfunction (4, 5), and exacerbations
  of chronic respiratory (6) and cardiovascular (7) disease, as well as all-cause
  mortality (3). The association between the particular temperatures at which risks
  are manifested and the magnitude of the effects vary regionally due to acclimatization,
  air conditioning prevalence, demography , and other factors (8). Successful risk
  management varies by setting and includes prevention strategies ranging from engineering
  controls such as air conditioning, management controls such as shifts in work schedules
  and activity restrictions, and behavioral controls encouraged through heat early
  warning systems and action plans (9). These systems and plans are activities that
  link forecasts of heat exposure with risk communication and risk reduction activities
  aimed at reducing exposure and limiting adverse health impacts among the exposed
  such as cooling centers, neighbor check-ins, and maintenance of air conditioning
  availability (10), which have been linked with reduced morbidity and mortality.
  Given variability in temperature thresholds at which risks increase , one central
  consideration in heat early warning systems is the threshold at which warnings should
  be issued (11). Guidance recommends setting thresholds based on analysis of associations
  between heat exposure (measured using a variety of metrics) and adverse health effects
  (9). In the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
  National Weather Service (NWS) issues excessive heat watch, warning, and heat advisory
  alerts as weather conditions warrant. While NWS provides guidance to its Weather
  Forecast Offices (WFOs) on appropriate thresholds for issuing these alerts, WFOs
  are encouraged to work with local officials to define locally appropriate alert
  thresholds (12). There is no standard protocol for incorporating local epidemiological
  analyses, as relevant data and expertise may not be locally available. In addition
  to these constraints, risk assessment has been complicated by a lack of consensus
  regarding exposure assessment (e.g., which temperature metrics to use), standardization
  of heat-sensitive health outcomes (e.g., morbidity measures or mortality) and resulting
  heat attributable health impacts, and standard analytical approaches , despite emerging
  consensus in the field that best practices include basing thresholds on recent time-series
  analyses of the relationship between temperature and the best available local health
  data (9, 13). Recent analyses have demonstrated Significance Heat early warning
  systems and action plans have been shown to reduce risks of heat exposure, and best
  practice recommends that plans be built around local epidemiologic evidence and
  emergency management capacity. This evaluation provides useful information for heat
  early warning system and action plan administrators regarding the temperature ranges
  at which health impacts are manifest, the morbidity outcomes most sensitive to heat,
  and alignment between alert thresholds and temperatures at which disease burden
  is most pronounced. The results suggest opportunities for improvement and for refinement
  of prevention messaging as well as coordination between meteorological and public
  health authorities at multiple levels before, during, and after periods of extreme
  heat.
