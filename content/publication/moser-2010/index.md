abstract: This article presents a systematic framework to identify barriers that may
  impede the process of adaptation to climate change. The framework targets the process
  of planned adaptation and focuses on potentially challenging but malleable barriers.
  Three key sets of components create the architecture for the framework. First, a
  staged depiction of an idealized, rational approach to adaptation decision-making
  makes up the process component. Second, a set of interconnected structural elements
  includes the actors, the larger context in which they function (e.g., governance),
  and the object on which they act (the system of concern that is exposed to climate
  change). At each of these stages, we ask (i) what could impede the adaptation process
  and (ii) how do the actors, context, and system of concern contribute to the barrier.
  To facilitate the identification of barriers, we provide a series of diagnostic
  questions. Third, the framework is completed by a simple matrix to help locate points
  of intervention to overcome a given barrier. It provides a systematic starting point
  for answering critical questions about how to support climate change adaptation
  at all levels of decision-making.
