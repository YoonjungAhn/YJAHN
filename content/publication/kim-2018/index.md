abstract: "A typology of urban vacant land was developed, using Roanoke, Virginia,
  as the study area. A comprehensive literature review, field measurements and observations,
  including photographs, and quantitative based approach to assessing vacant land
  forest structure and values (i-Tree Eco sampling) were utilized, along with aerial
  photo interpretation, and ground-truthing methods, to identify and catalog vacant
  parcels of land.; The following types of urban vacant land were identified: post-industrial
  (3.34 km²), derelict (4.01 km²), unattended with vegetation (17.3 km²), natural
  (2.78 km²), and transportation-related (5.01 km²). Unattended with vegetation sites
  can be important resources that support urban ecosystem health; the most effective
  ecosystem benefits occur in natural sites based on their per-ha value. The redesign
  of post-industrial sites could build a city's image, while transportation-related
  sites can contribute a green infrastructure network of open spaces across a city.
  This typological study could have significant implications for policy development,
  and for planners and designers seeking to utilize urban vacant land to the best
  advantage."
