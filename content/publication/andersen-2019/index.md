abstract: In 2016, an intense drought occurred in the southeastern U.S. Dry conditions
  resulted in unprecedented wildfires throughout the southern Appalachian Mountains,
  especially in western North Carolina (WNC). Future climate change is expected to
  increase temperatures, alter precipitation, and stress water resources in the region,
  which could lead to more frequent drought and wildfire. The increasing threat of
  destructive wildfires combined with a growing wildland-urban interface indicate
  a need for a comprehensive assessment of wildfire vulnerability in WNC, while recent
  wildfires offer an opportunity to evaluate assessment accuracy. The study identifies
  locations vulnerable to wildfire in WNC based on wildfires from 1985 through 2016.
  By combining tract-level socioeconomic and physical data in a geographic information
  system, specific locations of vulnerability were identified and validated using
  wildfire perimeters from 2016. Unlike previous vulnerability research, this study
  integrates novel methods in GIS, including analytical hierarchical processing, validation,
  and GIS multi-decision criteria decision making to ensure vulnerability is accurately
  calculated. The vulnerability index indicates that social vulnerability varies greatly
  throughout the region, while physical and overall wildfire vulnerability is greatest
  in rural, mountainous portions of the region, which are less equipped for mitigation.
  Based on the results, the impacts of future wildfires on quality of life will vary
  across the region, so targeted responses are needed. The vulnerability index provides
  transparency to vulnerable communities, enabling policymakers to identify opportunities
  to prepare for resilience by targeting vulnerability hotspots.
