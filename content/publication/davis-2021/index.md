abstract: As global temperatures go up and incomes rise, air conditioner sales are
  poised to increase dramatically. Recent studies explore the potential economic and
  environmental impacts of this growth, but relatively little attention has been paid
  to the implications for inequality. In this paper we use household-level microdata
  from 16 countries to characterize empirically the relationship between climate,
  income, and residential air conditioning. We show that both current and future air
  conditioner usage is concentrated among high-income households. Not only do richer
  countries have much more air conditioning than poorer countries, but within countries
  adoption is highly concentrated among high-income households. The pattern of adoption
  is particularly stark in relatively low-income countries such as Pakistan, where
  we show that the vast majority of adoption between now and 2050 will be concentrated
  among the upper income tercile. We use our model to forecast future adoption, show
  how patterns vary across countries and income levels, and discuss what these patterns
  mean for health, productivity, and educational inequality.
