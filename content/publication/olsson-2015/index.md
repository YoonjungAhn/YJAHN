abstract: 'Scope, Delineations, and Definitions: Livelihoods, Poverty, and Inequality
  Understanding the impacts of climate change on livelihoods and poverty requires
  examining the complexities of poverty and the lives of poor and non-poor people,
  as well as the multifaceted and cross-scalar intersections of poverty and livelihoods
  with climate change. This chapter is devoted to exploring poverty in relation to
  climate change, a novelty in the IPCC. It uses a livelihood lens to assess the interactions
  between climate change and multiple dimensions of poverty. We use the term \"the
  poor,\" not to homogenize, but to describe people living in poverty, people facing
  multiple deprivations, and the socially and economically disadvantaged, as part
  of a conceptualization broader than income-based measures of poverty, acknowledging
  gradients of prosperity and poverty. This livelihood lens also reveals how inequalities
  perpetuate poverty to shape differential vulnerabilities and in turn the differentiated
  impacts of climate change on individuals and societies. The chapter first presents
  the concepts of livelihoods, poverty, and inequality, and their relationships to
  each other and to climate change. Second, it describes observed impacts of weather
  events and climate on livelihoods and rural and urban poor people as well as projected
  impacts up to 2100. We use \"weather events and climate\" as an umbrella term for
  climate change, climate variability, and extreme events, and also highlight subtle
  shifts in precipitation and localized weather events. Third, this chapter discusses
  impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation responses on livelihoods and
  poverty. Finally, it outlines implications for poverty alleviation efforts and climate-resilient
  development pathways. Livelihoods and Poverty is a new chapter in the AR5. Although
  the WGII AR4 contributions mentioned poverty, as one of several non-climatic factors
  contributing to vulnerability, as a serious obstacle to effective adaptation, and
  in the context of endemic poverty in Africa (Chapters 7, 8, 18, 20), no systematic
  assessment was undertaken.'
