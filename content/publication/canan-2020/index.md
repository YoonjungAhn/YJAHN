abstract: This study presents an analysis of the thermo-hygrometric conditions in
  the city of Konya (Turkey). A one-year transversal field survey was carried out
  in the Selçuk University campus and 2295 valid questionnaires were collected. In
  each questionnaire, randomly selected interviewees provided personal information
  and judged their perception and thermal preference according to the ASHRAE 7-point
  and McIntyre scales, respectively. For each interviewee, a value of the Physiological
  Equivalent Temperature (PET) was calculated based on the values of operational variables
  obtained from the questionnaires and the environmental variables measured during
  the survey. This allowed to calculate the seasonal preferred and neutral PETs and
  the annual PET comfort range. Also, the scale of the PET thermal perception was
  determined for the Konya population and, more generally, for the inhabitants of
  the BSk Köppen-Geiger climate zone. Statistical analyzes carried out in terms of
  Variance Inflationary Factor, multicollinearity assessment and Best Subsets Analysis
  led to the identification of the Turkish Outdoor Comfort Index, an empirical index
  able to predict the average value of the thermal perception of a large group of
  individuals living in the aforementioned climate zone. Moreover, the equations of
  the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) were obtained for each season.
