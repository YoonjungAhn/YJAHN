abstract: 'Given the growing interest in community air quality monitoring using low-cost
  sensors, 30 PurpleAir II sensors (12 outdoor and 18 indoor) were deployed in partnership
  with community members living adjacent to a major interstate freeway from December
  2017- June 2019. Established quality assurance/quality control techniques for data
  processing were used and sensor data quality was evaluated by calculating data completeness
  and summarizing PM2.5 measurements. To evaluate outdoor sensor performance, correlation
  coefficients (r) and coefficients of divergence (CoD) were used to assess temporal
  and spatial variability of PM2.5 between sensors. PM2.5 concentrations were also
  compared to traffic levels to assess the sensorsâ€™ ability to detect traffic pollution.
  To evaluate indoor sensors, indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios during resident-reported
  activities were calculated and compared, and a linear mixed-effects regression model
  was developed to quantify the impacts of ambient air quality, microclimatic factors,
  and indoor human activities on indoor PM2.5. In general, indoor sensors performed
  more reliably than outdoor sensors (completeness: 73% versus 54%). All outdoor sensors
  were highly temporally correlated (r > 0.98) and spatially homogeneous (CoD<0.06).
  The observed I/O ratios were consistent with existing literature, and the mixed-effects
  model explains >85% of the variation in indoor PM2.5 levels, indicating that indoor
  sensors detected PM2.5 from various sources. Overall, this study finds that community-maintained
  sensors can effectively monitor PM2.5, with main data quality concerns resulting
  from outdoor sensor data incompleteness.'
