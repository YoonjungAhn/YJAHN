abstract: In 1955 fewer than 2% of the nation's residences had air conditioning; by
  1980 over half were air conditioned, and over a quarter had central air. This paper
  attempts to explain the growth and the geographic differences in the prevalence
  of residential air conditioning from the mid fifties to 1980. Census data and data
  on climate and relevant prices are combined to estimate a model that focuses on
  the role of economic factors, that is, geographic differences and changes over time
  in incomes and prices, in affecting the pattern of diffusion of residential air
  conditioning. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
