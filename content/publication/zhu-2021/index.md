abstract: 'Background: The COVID-19 has caused a sizeable global outbreak and has
  been declared as a public health emergency of international concern. Sufficient
  evidence shows that temperature has an essential link with respiratory infectious
  diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the exposure-response relationship
  between ambient temperature, including extreme temperatures, and mortality of COVID-19.
  Methods: The Poisson distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was constructed to
  evaluate the non-linear delayed effects of ambient temperature on death, by using
  the daily new death of COVID-19 and ambient temperature data from January 10 to
  March 31, 2020, in Wuhan, China. Results: During the period mentioned above, the
  average daily number of COVID-19 deaths was approximately 45.2. Poisson distributed
  lag non-linear model showed that there was a non-linear relationship (U-shape) between
  the effect of ambient temperature and mortality. With confounding factors controlled,
  the daily cumulative relative death risk decreased by 12.3% (95% CI [3.4, 20.4%])
  for every 1.0 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, the delayed effects of the low
  temperature are acute and short-term, with the most considerable risk occurring
  in 5–7 days of exposure. The delayed effects of the high temperature appeared quickly,
  then decrease rapidly, and increased sharply 15 days of exposure, mainly manifested
  as acute and long-term effects. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated that the
  results were robust. Conclusions: The relationship between ambient temperature and
  COVID-19 mortality was non-linear. There was a negative correlation between the
  cumulative relative risk of death and temperature. Additionally, exposure to high
  and low temperatures had divergent impacts on mortality.'
