abstract: Population numbers at local levels are fundamental data for many applications,
  including the delivery and planning of services, election preparation, and response
  to disasters. In resource-poor settings, recent and reliable demographic data at
  subnational scales can often be lacking. National population and housing census
  data can be outdated, inaccurate, or missing key groups or areas, while registry
  data are generally lacking or incomplete. Moreover, at local scales accurate boundary
  data are often limited, and high rates of migration and urban growth make existing
  data quickly outdated. Here we review past and ongoing work aimed at producing spatially
  disaggregated local-scale population estimates, and discuss how new technologies
  are now enabling robust and cost-effective solutions. Recent advances in the availability
  of detailed satellite imagery, geopositioning tools for field surveys, statistical
  methods, and computational power are enabling the development and application of
  approaches that can estimate population distributions at fine spatial scales across
  entire countries in the absence of census data. We outline the potential of such
  approaches as well as their limitations, emphasizing the political and operational
  hurdles for acceptance and sustainable implementation of new approaches, and the
  continued importance of traditional sources of national statistical data.
