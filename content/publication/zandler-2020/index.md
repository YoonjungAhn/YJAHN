abstract: Global environmental research requires long-term climate data. Yet, meteorological
  infrastructure is missing in the vast majority of the world’s protected areas. Therefore,
  gridded products are frequently used as the only available climate data source in
  peripheral regions. However, associated evaluations are commonly biased towards
  well observed areas and consequently, station-based datasets. As evaluations on
  vegetation monitoring abilities are lacking for regions with poor data availability,
  we analyzed the potential of several state-of-the-art climate datasets (CHIRPS,
  CRU, ERA5-Land, GPCC-Monitoring-Product, IMERG-GPM, MERRA-2, MODIS-MOD10A1) for
  assessing NDVI anomalies (MODIS-MOD13Q1) in two particularly suitable remote conservation
  areas. We calculated anomalies of 156 climate variables and seasonal periods during
  2001–2018, correlated these with vegetation anomalies while taking the multiple
  comparison problem into consideration, and computed their spatial performance to
  derive suitable parameters. Our results showed that four datasets (MERRA-2, ERA5-Land,
  MOD10A1, CRU) were suitable for vegetation analysis in both regions, by showing
  significant correlations controlled at a false discovery rate < 5% and in more than
  half of the analyzed areas. Cross-validated variable selection and importance assessment
  based on the Boruta algorithm indicated high importance of the reanalysis datasets
  ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 in both areas but higher differences and variability between
  the regions with all other products. CHIRPS, GPCC and the bias-corrected version
  of MERRA-2 were unsuitable and not important in both regions. We provide evidence
  that reanalysis datasets are most suitable for spatiotemporally consistent environmental
  analysis whereas gauge- or satellite-based products and their combinations are highly
  variable and may not be applicable in peripheral areas.
