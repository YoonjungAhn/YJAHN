abstract: 'Modern data linkage and technologies provide a way to reconstruct detailed
  longitudinal profiles of health outcomes and predictors at the individual or small-area
  level. Although these rich data resources offer the possibility to address epidemiologic
  questions that could not be feasibly examined using traditional studies, they require
  innovative analytical approaches. Here we present a new study design, called case
  time series, for epidemiologic investigations of transient health risks associated
  with time-varying exposures. This design combines a longitudinal structure and flexible
  control of time-varying confounders, typical of aggregated time series, with individual-level
  analysis and control-by-design of time-invariant between-subject differences, typical
  of self-matched methods such as case-crossover and self-controlled case series.
  The modeling framework is highly adaptable to various outcome and exposure definitions,
  and it is based on efficient estimation and computational methods that make it suitable
  for the analysis of highly informative longitudinal data resources. We assess the
  methodology in a simulation study that demonstrates its validity under defined assumptions
  in a wide range of data settings. We then illustrate the design in real-data examples:
  a first case study replicates an analysis on influenza infections and the risk of
  myocardial infarction using linked clinical datasets, while a second case study
  assesses the association between environmental exposures and respiratory symptoms
  using real-time measurements from a smartphone study. The case time series design
  represents a general and flexible tool, applicable in different epidemiologic areas
  for investigating transient associations with environmental factors, clinical conditions,
  or medications.'
