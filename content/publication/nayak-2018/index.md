abstract: "Objectives: The frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are increasing
  in New York State (NYS) and have been linked with increased heat-related morbidity
  and mortality. But these effects are not uniform across the state and can vary across
  large regions due to regional sociodemographic and environmental factors which impact
  an individual's response or adaptive capacity to heat and in turn contribute to
  vulnerability among certain populations. We developed a heat vulnerability index
  (HVI) to identify heat-vulnerable populations and regions in NYS. Study design:
  Census tract level environmental and sociodemographic heat-vulnerability variables
  were used to develop the HVI to identify heat-vulnerable populations and areas.
  Methods: Variables were identified from a comprehensive literature review and climate-health
  research in NYS. We obtained data from 2010 US Census Bureau and 2011 National Land
  Cover Database. We used principal component analysis to reduce correlated variables
  to fewer uncorrelated components, and then calculated the cumulative HVI for each
  census tract by summing up the scores across the components. The HVI was then mapped
  across NYS (excluding New York City) to display spatial vulnerability. The prevalence
  rates of heat stress were compared across HVI score categories. Results: Thirteen
  variables were reduced to four meaningful components representing 1) social/language
  vulnerability; 2) socioeconomic vulnerability; 3) environmental/urban vulnerability;
  and 4) elderly/ social isolation. Vulnerability to heat varied spatially in NYS
  with the HVI showing that metropolitan areas were most vulnerable, with language
  barriers and socioeconomic disadvantage contributing to the most vulnerability.
  Reliability of the HVI was supported by preliminary results where higher rates of
  heat stress were collocated in the regions with the highest HVI. Conclusions: The
  NYS HVI showed spatial variability in heat vulnerability across the state. Mapping
  the HVI allows quick identification of regions in NYS that could benefit from targeted
  interventions. The HVI will be used as a planning tool to help allocate appropriate
  adaptation measures like cooling centers and issue heat alerts to mitigate effects
  of heat in vulnerable areas."
