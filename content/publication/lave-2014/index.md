abstract: "A recent opinion piece rekindled debate as to whether geography's current
  interdisciplinary make-up is a historical relic or an actual and potential source
  of intellectual vitality. Taking the latter position, we argue here for the benefits
  of sustained integration of physical and critical human geography. For reasons both
  political and pragmatic, we term this area of intermingled research and practice
  critical physical geography (CPG). CPG combines critical attention to power relations
  with deep knowledge of biophysical science or technology in the service of social
  and environmental transformation. We argue that whether practiced by individuals
  or teams, CPG research can improve the intellectual quality and expand the political
  relevance of both physical and critical human geography because it is increasingly
  impractical to separate analysis of natural and social systems: socio-biophysical
  landscapes are as much the product of unequal power relations, histories of colonialism,
  and racial and gender disparities as they are of hydrology, ecology, and climate
  change. Here, we review existing CPG work; discuss the primary benefits of critically
  engaged integrative research, teaching, and practice; and offer our collective thoughts
  on how to make CPG work. © 2013 Canadian Association of Geographers / L' Association
