abstract: Protecting health from rising temperatures and extreme heat Key facts 
  Population exposure to heat is increasing due to climate change, and this trend
  will continue. Globally, extreme temperature events are observed to be increasing
  in their frequency, duration, and magnitude. Between 2000 and 2016, the number of
  people exposed to heat waves increased by around 125 million. In 2015 alone, 175
  million additional people were exposed to heat waves compared to average years.
   Single events can last weeks, occur consecutively, and result in significant excess
  mortality. In 2003, 70,000 people in Europe died as a result of the June-August
  event, in 2010, 56,000 excess deaths occurred during a 44-day heatwave in the Russian
  Federation.  Exposure to excessive heat has wide ranging physiological impacts
  for all humans, often amplifying existing conditions and resulting in premature
  death and disability.  The negative health impacts of heat are predictable and
  largely preventable with specific public health actions. WHO has issued public health
  guidance for the general public and medical professionals on coping with extreme
  heat. Overview Global temperatures and the frequency and intensity of heatwaves
  will rise in the 21st century as a result of climate change. Extended periods of
  high day and nighttime temperatures create cumulative physiological stress on the
  human body which exacerbates the top causes of death globally, including respiratory
  and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and renal disease. Heatwaves can
  acutely impact large populations for short periods of time, often trigger public
  health emergencies, and result in excess mortality, and cascading socioeconomic
  impacts (e.g. lost work capacity and labor productivity). They can also cause loss
  of health service delivery capacity, where power-shortages which often accompany
  heatwaves disrupt health facilities, transport, and water infrastructure. Awareness
  remains insufficient of the health risks posed by heatwaves and prolonged exposure
  to increased temperatures. Health professionals must adjust their planning and interventions
  to account for increasing temperatures and heatwaves. Practical, feasible, and often
  low-cost interventions at the individual, community, organizational, governmental
  and societal levels, can save lives. Who is affected? Rising global ambient temperatures
  affect all populations. However, some populations are more exposed to, or more physiologically
  or socioeconomically vulnerable to physiological stress, exacerbated illness, and
  an increased risk of death from exposure to excess heat. These include the elderly,
  infants and children, pregnant women, outdoor and manual workers, athletes, and
  the poor. Gender can play an important role in determining heat exposure. How does
  heat impact health? Heat gain in the human body can be caused by a combination of
  external heat from the environment and internal body heat generated from metabolic
  processes. Rapid rises in heat gain due to exposure to hotter than average conditions
  compromises the body's ability to regulate temperature and can result in a cascade
  of illnesses, including heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and hyperthermia.
