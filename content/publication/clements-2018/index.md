abstract: Aerosol measurements were collected at fifteen homes over the course of
  one year in Colorado (USA) to understand the temporal variability of indoor air
  particulate matter and bacterial concentrations and their relationship with home
  characteristics, inhabitant activities, and outdoor air particulate matter (PM).
  Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations averaged (±st. dev.) 8.1 ± 8.1 μg/m3 and
  6.8 ± 4.5 μg/m3, respectively. Indoor PM2.5 was statistically significantly higher
  during summer compared to spring and winter; outdoor PM2.5 was significantly higher
  for summer compared to spring and fall. The PM2.5 I/O ratio was 1.6 ± 2.4 averaged
  across all homes and seasons and was not statistically significantly different across
  the seasons. Average indoor PM10 was 15.4 ± 18.3 μg/m3 and was significantly higher
  during summer compared to all other seasons. Total suspended particulate bacterial
  biomass, as determined by qPCR, revealed very little seasonal differences across
  and within the homes. The qPCR I/O ratio was statistically different across seasons,
  with the highest I/O ratio in the spring and lowest in the summer. Using one-minute
  indoor PM10 data and activity logs, it was observed that elevated particulate concentrations
  commonly occurred when inhabitants were cooking and during periods with elevated
  outdoor concentrations.
