abstract: This article aims studying the course held by Michel Foucault at the Collège
  de France in 1973-1974. The records of this course were published in 2003 under
  the name Psychiatric power' . The objective was to compare the different ways in
  which Foucault analyzes the question of madness in Psychiatric power' and in History
  of Madness in the Classical Age' (1961). It is a comparative study about the different
  ways of analyzing madness developed by Michel Foucault during the archeological
  and genealogic periods of his work. The absence of the body; binary diagnosis; the
  description of the surface of symptoms; the classification of diseases more similar
  to the botanical classification than to pathology; the process of cure directly
  linked to restitution of behaviors and moral values; as well as the over-power of
  the psychiatrist, seem to speak about the persistence of an old model of power,
  a pre-modern and pre-capitalist model, a residue of the old sovereign power.
