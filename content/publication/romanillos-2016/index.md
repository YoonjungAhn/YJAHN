abstract: Maps are currently experiencing a paradigm shift from static representations
  to dynamic platforms that capture, visualize and analyse new data, bringing different
  possibilities for exploration and research. The first objective of this paper is
  to present a map that illustrates, for the first time, the real flow of casual cyclists
  and bike messengers in the city of Madrid. The second objective is to describe the
  development and results of the Madrid Cycle Track initiative, an online platform
  launched with the aim of collecting cycling routes and other information from volunteers.
  In the framework of this initiative, different online maps are presented and their
  functionalities described. Finally, a supplemental video visualizes the cyclist
  flow over the course of a day. ARTICLE HISTORY
