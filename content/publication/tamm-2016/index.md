abstract: "The question of truth stands at the core of Foucault's philosophy. He was
  interested in how different pieces of knowledge had attained truth status over the
  course of history, how power had legitimated itself through truth, how people had
  shaped themselves via producing truth. The multivolume History of Sexuality, conceived
  in the 1970s, was originally intended as a study of the relationship between sex
  and truth. This project that spread over almost ten years constituted Foucault's
  main laboratory of the history of truth, where he could test new concepts, ideas,
  and materials. The project went through a very important transformation in time:
  while in 1970s, Foucault was primarily interested in the relations between truth,
  sex and power, in the 1980s he mainly studies the relations between truth, sex and
  the subject. Looking back at the evolution of his thought in the second volume of
  his History of Sexuality, Foucault admits to realising that all of his work has
  in fact been dealing with the history of truth: “I seem to have gained a better
  perspective on the way I worked – gropingly, and by means of different or successive
  fragments – on this project, whose goal is a history of truth.”"
