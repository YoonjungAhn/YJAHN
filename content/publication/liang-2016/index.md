abstract: Recently, PM2.5 (atmospheric fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter
  ≤2.5μm) have received so much attention that the observations, source appointment
  and countermeasures of it have been widely studied due to its harmful impacts on
  visibility, mood (mental health), physical health, traffic safety, construction,
  economy and nature, as well as its complex interaction with climate. A review on
  the PM2.5 related research is necessary. We start with summary of chemical composition
  and characteristics of PM2.5 that contains both macro and micro observation results
  and analysis, wherein the temporal variability of concentrations of PM2.5 and major
  components in many recent reports is embraced. This is closely followed by an overview
  of source appointment, including the composition and sources of PM2.5 in different
  countries in the six inhabitable continents based on the best available results.
  Besides summarizing PM2.5 pollution countermeasures by policy, planning, technology
  and ideology, the World Air Day is proposed to be established to inspire and promote
  the crucial social action in energy-saving and emission-reduction. Some updated
  knowledge of the important topics (such as formation and evolution mechanisms of
  hazes, secondary aerosols, aerosol mass spectrometer, organic tracers, radiocarbon,
  emissions, solutions for air pollution problems, etc.) is also included in the present
  review by logically synthesizing the studies. In addition, the key research challenges
  and future directions are put forward. Despite our efforts, our understanding of
  the recent reported observations, source identifications and countermeasures of
  PM2.5 is limited, and subsequent efforts both of the authors and readers are needed.
