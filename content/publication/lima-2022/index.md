abstract: <p>Housing quality is a well-established determinant for health and its
  relevance has been increasing in the context of sustainable development. Prior research
  has emphasized the importance of adequate housing for the health and comfort of
  householders. However, this link is still poorly characterized and understood regarding
  the vulnerable segments of the population. In this study, a mediation analysis is
  proposed to test and identify the role of energy affordability in the relationship
  between poor housing and health status. It resorts to microdata from the European
  Union—Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) database, focusing on
  the analysis of Portugal as the case study. Research findings confirm the role of
  energy affordability as a mediator. The research findings supported the energy efficiency
  as a direct pathway with protective and preventive effect for poor health, followed
  by energy affordability as a mediated or indirect pathway. A complementary approach
  that addresses energy efficiency and energy poverty should be pursued to maximize
  health risk reduction.</p>
