## Overview

1. **COURSE PURPOSE** This course will introduce the statistical concepts underpinning and methods used in the analyses of geographical data. Topics include descriptive and inferential statistics, fundamental conepts in probability, including probability distributions and hypothesis testing, contingency tables, analyses of time series data, point, and area pattern analyses, measures of autocorrelation, sampling, parametric and non-parametric analyses, correlation, and regression. In addition, this course will provide an introduction to the powerful and open-source R scripting language useful for geographical data analyses.
2. **RESEARCH INTENSIVE COURSE** In revising GEOG 316 to include a more comprehensive research and creative component, I plan to enhance the research methodologies taught through active learning strategies. Throughout the course, students will work collaboratively on research projects, developing presentations where they will share their findings. This aims not only to improve their research capabilities but also to enhance their presentation and dissemination skills.
